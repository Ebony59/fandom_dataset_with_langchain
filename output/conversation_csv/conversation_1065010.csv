0,1065010,Harry,Healer,"Harry: It's hard going. You should contact his family, just to be on the safe side.
Healer: There's no one to contact.
Harry: He doesn't have a niece. He doesn't have any immediate family. Everyone's dead.
Healer: That's odd... He kept saying 'my niece, get her, my niece'.
Harry: Hermione. Fuck, that's who she's been-- I know who he meant. I'll, er. God, this is.... I'll get her.
Healer: You may want to be quick about it. He lost a lot of blood. We can't make any promises.

Harry: They haven't said... That's good, though. That's good. If the Healers haven't said anything, that means there's nothing to say, right? I mean, if it was bad news, they'd have told us.
Ron: *rolls his eyes and mouths an insult at Harry*
Hermione: He should have been with me... He was supposed to be with me. That's what I asked for. My Christmas present. It was the only thing I asked him for. To come to dinner at the Burrow so we could-could announce.... So we could tell everyone.
Hermione: We were going to tell everyone about us. We were ready. It was going to be my present. All of us, everyone I love in the wizarding world, all together.
Harry: *strokes her hair and exhales slowly*

Mediwitch: Mrs Malfoy?
Hermione: *looks up, her hand locked tight around Harry's*
Mediwitch: Come with me.

Harry: Everything under control, Frank?
Frank Lambswool: Nothing to worry about... Usually quiet right before Christmas. Seems like even the criminals want to behave just so's they don't lose out on presents."
1,1065010,Frank,Harry,"Frank: Nothing to worry about. Usually quiet right before Christmas. Seems like even the criminals want to behave just so's they don't lose out on presents. Never you mind me. I like seeing the young'uns have a good time with their families. Gupta will be in later and she'll thrash me at checkers again. Holiday tradition and all. Go on and have your fun. We'll hold the fort.
Harry: All right, then. *points to the silver badge pinned to his coat* Don't forget to call if you need.
Frank: If it had teeth, it would've bit--
Harry: Auror down, Auror down! Assistance! Dammit, somebody help!
Anthony: Auror down! Potter, Lambswool, Gupta, whoever's in the office, hurry! Malfoy's down! *Harry slaps his badge, silencing the alarm* Anthony, we're on our way.

Harry: Is he--
Hermione: They don't know. They said, they said. They did everything they could. The blood loss, the shock. They don't.... Wait until morning, they said. See if he lives through the night.
Harry: Is there anything I can do? Want me to go back to yours, get a change of clothes? Any messages for anyone? Practically every Weasley in the world is out in the waiting room.
Hermione: Tell them I'm sorry. And tell them to go home. They shouldn't miss out on everything for me. And-and make sure Ron doesn't eat all the apple pie. I bribed Draco with it to get him to come to the party. We have to save a piece for him.

Hermione: I'm here, love. Stay with me, Draco. I'm right here.
Harry: *slowly backs out of the room*

Mediwitch: You're here about Malfoy?
Harry: Sign here to collect his belongings."
2,1065010,Harry,Draco,"Harry: Sign here to collect his belongings.
Harry: An outrageous amount of money he was sure Draco thought of as nothing more than pocket change.
Harry: Hermione's influence, he thought.
Harry: There was no question who the ring was for, not now that he knew.
Harry: What box? he said. I didn't see Malfoy's gift for his girlfriend in there, did you?
Frank: Don't have my glasses, he said. Didn't see a thing.
Harry: He's looking good this morning.
Hermione: He is, Hermione said. Look at that. He's been doing that for the past few hours. He might.... He might come back today. Wouldn't that be a wonderful present, Harry? Don't you think?
Harry: Speaking of presents, he said. I, er. It's a good thing this is rather a large room. Because--
Molly: Oh, for goodness' sake, Harry, move out of the way. We're blocking traffic out here.
Hermione: What's going on?
Ron: Don't blame us, he mumbled. It was Harry's idea. He told us what you wanted for Christmas - y'know, everyone around with Malfoy there and all. Since he can't bloody well come to the Burrow....
Fleur: We 'ave brought ze Burrow to 'im, Fleur said.
Molly: Oh, dear, she said, frowning. It's far too big. Well, I didn't have much time to make it smaller."
3,1065010,Harry,Hermione,"Harry: I want to talk to you, *Harry had to cover his mouth to keep from laughing at the shock on Hermione's face.*
Hermione: *She tried to speak and couldn't. Her mouth moved, but no sound emerged, not then, and not for any of the other presents that the Weasleys brought forth.*
Harry: You got him something too?
Hermione: Nah, it's not for him, *Hermione asked as she wiped tears off her face.*
Harry: It's from him. It was in his things when we brought him in. Fairly certain it's for you.
Hermione: 'Thank you,' she read in a whisper. 'For giving me another chance at life.'
Hermione: I love you, she said. Please come back. That's what I really want for Christmas, Draco. Another chance at life.
Draco: He'ne, he croaked. His brows slowly knotted and he gave a soft grunt. Po'er?
Harry: Look, Malfoy, he said, shaking his head. There's no way of getting out of a Weasley Christmas, even by getting shot.
Harry: Later, he said. Much later. Hermione, kiss your damn boyfriend, would you?
Harry: *He slipped out of the hospital room and slumped against the wall in the hallway, swearing and muttering gratitudes to whoever might be listening.*
Harry: Draco was going to live.
Harry: *Harry stepped aside for a Healer rushing to Draco's room, and he went to tell the Weasleys that Hermione had got her Christmas present after all.*"
