0,10741320,Draco,Pansy,"Draco: Isn't she lovely? What wonderful manners she has! But her family has always had impeccable breeding.
Draco's Mother: And how is dear Pansy doing?
Draco: Pansy was a particular favorite of Draco's mother. The Parkinson family had been very close to the Malfoy family. Both heads of the house were currently widows who had lost their husbands in the Wizarding War, and so Draco and Pansy had grown up closely together. Draco didn't quite have the heart to reveal to his mother that Pansy was becoming more and more intolerable every year. Her possessive attitude grated his nerves, her lack of attention to her own schoolwork irritated him, and, he was sorry to agree with the prevailing opinion, but her face really did resemble a pug. But whenever his mother asked, he always told her that Pansy was doing well in school, she was well-regarded, and she was growing lovelier every day. It was only the slightest stretch of the truth, and Slytherins had no compunction about sometimes slightly stretching the truth.
Draco's Mother: *asks about the girls he likes and the ones he doesn't like*
Draco: She didn't particularly seem interested in the girls whose names he couldn't remember.
Draco: If there was one topic his mother absolutely hated, though, it was the subject of Hermione Granger, the Muggle-born best friend of Harry Potter.
Draco: Draco had thought at first that he and Harry Potter ought to be the best of friends. After all, both of them had lost parents during the defeat of the Dark Lord. Being as how Potter was also distantly related to the House of Black, Draco had considered that they would get on quite famously. But instead Potter had taken up with the insufferable Weasley family—pureblood but poor, and completely unacceptable as appropriate companionship. Then to make it worse, he'd befriended the Muggle-born, and Draco had been glad that they were not friends after all.
Draco: She was irritating, Granger was; she thought she knew everything, and her not even coming from a respectable Wizarding family! Seeing her hand shooting up in the air to answer every question, and seeing her bushy hair bouncing as she nodded rapidly along to everything the professor said, only served to irritate him past all his patience.
Draco: Whenever he mentioned to his mother about what she had done, or more to the point, what he and his cronies had done to her and her friends, she always changed the subject rapidly. The first few times he told her about his latest prank, he was surprised that she offered no censure, such as she usually would when he regaled her with stories of how they had brought low some student or other. She was Slytherin enough to appreciate the tactics, but motherly enough to remind her son of appropriate behavior.
Draco: But when Draco did something to Granger, like when he switched her pot of ink with combustible jelly and everything she wrote on her parchment smoked and sparked, his mother simply switched topics. Not a single word would she comment about the Muggle-born, as if Draco hadn't even spoken. And she invariably turned the topic to a different girl."
1,10741320,Draco,Daphne,"Draco: How are Daphne's grades? I saw Milicent's mother while shopping last week. How is dear Pansy doing?
Draco's mother: *switched topics* How are Daphne's grades? I saw Milicent's mother while shopping last week. How is dear Pansy doing?
Draco: I had always thought that my mother was doing what every pureblood mother was doing: vetting the current generation for a future bride for her son.
Draco's mother: *revealed a secret* A Veela had once married into the Black family, her heritage hushed up to protect their status as pureblood.
Draco: To say I was surprised was an understatement. Distressed, I listened as she explained my hidden heritage and that having reached my majority I would begin to sense stirrings inside myself that were the presence of my mate.
Draco: To say I was angry was an overstatement. I had always assumed that I would choose a wife, or have one pre-chosen for me, based on an inflexible set of criteria.
Draco's mother: *cautioned him* Should you find your mate, you must not reveal to her the knowledge of what she was to you. In time, your Veela heritage may become obvious, especially while you were not yet bonded, but it was imperative that the Veela mate not feel pressured or obligated to bond with her Veela."
2,10741320,Draco,Veela,"Draco: Perhaps he wasn't Veela. After all, a male Veela was highly unusual. Or, without discounting his mother's Veela intuition, perhaps his mate simply wasn't at Hogwarts and he had at least another year before he had to worry about finding her.
Draco: He captained his Quidditch team, and though he didn't win as many matches as he'd once originally thought he would, he rather thought he found a measure of glory in the famous rivalry between him and the Gryffindor captain. If he didn't catch the snitch but ran Potter into the ground a time or two, he considered his playing to be quite successful.
Draco: Late at night, he'd lie in his bed, thinking over the lines that had already been penned in the book of his life. He'd once had it mapped out as far into the future as his mind's eye could see. But lately all he'd been able to see was the next week's quiz that he was sure to ace, or the next day's game of Quidditch.
Draco: He tried to write a future that encompassed his new, unidentified Veela mate. He tried to fit her into the plans he'd had, but somehow the picture could never come clear. Was she intelligent and kind?"
3,10741320,Alice,Bob,
4,10741320,Draco,Veela,"Draco: The world felt different. The colors perhaps a little brighter. The freshness of the wind perhaps a bit sharper. *He chalked it up to the change of the seasons.*
Draco: But whatever he had felt in the night, he was certain it was the sign he had been waiting for. *He went through the day mechanically, absorbed with contemplating this new turn of events, and periodically taking time to attempt, with no success, to recreate the incident of the night before.*
Draco: And when he finally went to bed, earlier than normal, he lay awake searching for his Veela. In the quiet, and in the dark, he waited for that beating he still wasnâ€™t sure he hadnâ€™t imagined.
Draco: Finally, late into the night, he was rewarded by that flickering sensation suddenly echoing in his breast again. This time his heartbeat slowed to match it immediately. *He sighed. The feeling was clearer this time. It thump-thumped precisely as his heart did. But it was so slow that it made him sleepy.*
Draco: No. Her heart. He was suddenly very sure that he could feel her heart. That empty space he envisioned as the place his mate would occupy was no longer empty. It was loud and vibrant, echoing with the sounds of her heartbeat, slow and steady. She must be sleeping, this late at night. That explained why it was always so slow. He could only connect with her when everything was very quiet, and he was very still, and both of them were near sleep.
Draco: He had a mate! And she must be at Hogwarts. Andâ€¦wellâ€¦the sum total of his knowledge was that she had a very healthy heartbeat. She also did not appear to suffer from insomnia. *Far from being discouraging, it actually made him feel almost giddy. His life was connected to anotherâ€™sâ€”a mate that would belong only to him, and he to her! A warmth spread through his body, like the pleasant low humming in the blood that comes after drinking a couple of butterbeers, if butterbeers were made of rainbows.*
Draco: He thought he felt the rumbling of his Veela, content and pleased. His mate was safe and she was sleeping."
5,10741320,Draco,Veela,"Draco: He thought he felt the rumbling of his Veela, content and pleased. His mate was safe and she was sleeping.
Draco: The next morning he woke up feeling excited and energized. Despite being far below ground in the dungeons, it felt very bright and sunny to him. For the first time, he was certain, absolutely certain, that he was Veela and that he had a mate. And that she was here somewhere in the school!
Draco: In a quiet corner of his soul, he could almost feel his Veela still slumbering. He didn’t know how else to describe the new, but strangely familiar sensation of Veela thoughts and instincts surfacing now that he’d connected with his mate.
Draco: The idea of such a loss of control would normally have been distasteful to him. Malfoys usually prided themselves on being in control of everything. Perhaps it was his Veela side already beginning to work on him, but he felt only a calming sense of assurance.
Draco: At the thought of her, and the memory of her heartbeat from the night before, he felt his Veela stir. For a moment, Draco could almost see the world around him awash in bright yellows and pale pinks. Almost like the first blush of sunrise. He blinked, and then it was gone, but the alert presence in his mind, remained. His Veela wanted his mate. No, he wanted his mate.
Draco: Could he reach her in the daylight? He’d tried and failed the day before, but he was certain their connection was stronger now.
Draco: His hands only slightly trembled with anxiety and excitement, as he closed his eyes and laid back against his pillows, trying to find that tiny light inside of him that was their shared destiny and follow it back to her.
Draco: He sat up and shook his head trying to clear it. He knew she was there; he only had to find her.
Draco: He closed his eyes again, his hands clenched around his large quilted blanket, and concentrated on the pale yellow and pink sensation he’d had when he’d first awoken. It had felt light and happy like laughter floating on a summer breeze, like that moment before you open up a gift, like your first bite of your favorite ice cream."
6,10741320,Draco,her,"Draco: He reminded himself to pay more attention next time, as it could have been a clue to her identity.
Draco: Late at night he still stayed up for hours listening to the steady drumming of her heart, and spinning crazy ideas of what it would be like for the two of them as a bonded Veela pair.
Draco: He was starting to get the hang of his new color-coded Veela senses.
Draco: Then there were the lovely shades of yellows and pinks and purples and orange-golds that were her.
Draco: Heâ€™d see a lilting stream of violet go by, and heâ€™d stop and look around frantically trying to figure out where she was.
Draco: A few of his friends were beginning to look askance at his unusual behavior.
Draco: Draco didnâ€™t bother explaining himself as there was no sense telling him that the 5th year had the most beautiful brown eyes.
Draco: The Veela part of him refused to get on that up-and-down emotional broom ride, and was perpetually hopeful.
Draco: His biggest clue came one day as he was walking through the courtyard, lost in thought."
7,10741320,Granger,Malfoy,"Granger: Run along, Calliope. *pats the girl on the head* Hogwarts: A History is my favorite book, I'm sure you'll enjoy it.
Malfoy: *scowls at her*
Granger: You've been acting strange lately, Malfoy. I've been getting weird reports from people saying you've been uncharacteristically nice.
Malfoy: I'm nice!
Granger: I said 'uncharacteristically.' You've been picking up books, opening doors, helping people get things off tall shelves, passing the potatoes without complaint. It's beginning to scare people. Particularly the little ones. So try not to act too weird, okay? *hides a laugh as she walks away*
Malfoy: *stomps off to his next class, feeling 'uncharacteristically' cross*
Malfoy: *carefully pulls out from the corner of his mind the cherished picture of his mate* Her heartbeat drummed ever firm and steady. He could almost, almost make out the darkness of her eyes. And shining around it all, he saw a halo of golden brown curls, shifting and shimmering. He watched it as it curled and uncurled through his mind, an ache forming deep inside his heart as his fingers twitched to touch. The Veela inside of him was a lonely grey-blue, longing to reach out to its mate, to be able to hold her and cradle her in his arms. To look into her eyes, to rest his head against her heartbeat, to touch her precious hair. The greys almost felt like they could swallow him alive."
8,10741320,Draco,Veela,"Draco: The Veela inside of him was a lonely grey-blue, longing to reach out to its mate, to be able to hold her and cradle her in his arms. To look into her eyes, to rest his head against her heartbeat, to touch her precious hair. The greys almost felt like they could swallow him alive. He was close to discovering her identity, he knew it. He should be feeling more hopeful, not less. But the stormy grey of dread hovered in the back of his mind. As he finally drifted off to sleep, he thought he heard the faintest echo of a rose-colored laugh.
Draco: The Yule ball was a highlight for most of the school, a reason to dress up in fancy robes, and a pre-celebration of the holiday to come. Draco had been particularly excited all day as he knew that at least all of the 5th years and above would be gathered together in one place. He'd be able to test several of the girls, possibly all of them if he was particularly observant and cunning. As he descended the staircase into the ballroom, he was nearly giddy with the thought that he could find her today. He could really find her today. His inner Veela was excited with strangely appropriate swirls of festive scarlets and emeralds.
Draco: As he looked around at the clumps of people gathered together, he saw a flash of brown curl that almost stopped his heart. It was long and cascading from an intricate mass at the top of her head, covering the back of a periwinkle dress. Draco had gotten particularly good at naming shades of color.
Draco: There was something about looking at that hair that made him feel all the air had rushed out of his lungs. It wasn't a plain brown. It was chestnut and gold and warm and alive and it was her, it had to be her.
Draco: And it was...familiar? He thought he knew that hair. Something tickled in the back of his mind. That empty space that had filled with things about his mate seemed to swell until it tingled in his veins. His heart beat quick and light, but it was so loud in his ears he wondered if it was because it was matched with hers.
Draco: Even before she turned, intuition seized him, and the moment of clarity illuminated all of the clues he had been painstakingly piecing together...and apparently simultaneously ignoring. Because he definitely knew that hair.
Draco: He'd always known that hair. He'd stared at it, he'd jinxed it, one memorable day he'd gotten his wand, his hand, and a good portion of his arm, stuck in it. But for the first time he was overcome with a longing to touch it. To touch her. To reach out to her and pull her towards him.
Draco: And as he had this revelation—the once-empty space suddenly filling in brightly with colors and sounds and thoughts and feelings, creating a picture so bright and vivid he had to blink to make sure he was still seeing what was in front of him—her face turned towards him, showing him the exact match to the image suddenly emblazoned on his soul.
Draco: She laughed at something someone in her circle said, and it was yellows and golds and corals that circled..."
9,10741320,Draco,Veela,"Draco: His Veela was awake—squawking, crowing, roaring—whatever explained this overwhelming feeling of needing to laugh and cry and dance and fly all at the same time. But he didn’t move a muscle. Because there was still a tiny part of him that was just Draco, and it knew what the Veela would shortly learn.

Draco: Fury! Crimsons and ugly, sharp blacks! How dare he! How dare this interloper lay hands and lips on his mate! Hermione Granger had a boyfriend. Hermione Granger was as good as married off to the Weasel in the eyes of the population of Hogwarts. Hermione Granger…had chosen a mate.

Draco: Despair! Soggy greys. Slushy, muddy, suffocating browns. It was inconceivable to his Veela. He almost panted with the need to run talons across the smiling freckly face and cry Challenge. But the despair was like a tidal wave overwhelming the fury. He could not win. She would never choose him. Even if there was no Ron Weasley, she would never choose him. She was forever lost to him.

Draco: The pain was blinding. He didn’t see where he was going, only that he needed to get out of the Great Hall. He needed to breathe, he needed the air across his face. He was down the stairs and into the courtyard, and then past the courtyard and into the darkness, before he realized where he was. He stood on the edge of the path to the forest, breathing hard, his heart pounding erratically, a cruel reminder of the steady, soft beating he could still feel in his chest.

Draco: He needed a broom. He needed to stretch his wings and fly hard and fast into the blackness. But he didn’t move, because the part of him that was still just Draco was afraid of what would happen if he let the Veela control him. So he..."
10,10741320,Draco,Narcissa,"Draco: Is it supposed to be like this? *voice trembled, painfully unsure* Have you found her, then?
Narcissa: But that's wonderful, Draco! Truly, I had hoped you'd find her at school, and wouldn't have to conduct a long search!
Draco: It's horrible, Mother. She'll never have me.
Narcissa: Nonsense. We'll start by inviting her over to the Manor for brunch! Won't that be lovely?
Draco: Mother, she's chosen a mate already.
Narcissa: What? That can't be! So soon? It shouldn't be possible!"
11,10741320,Draco,Narcissa,"Draco: What? That can't be! So soon? It shouldn't be possible!
Draco: So soon? You mean it is possible for her to choose a mate other than her Veela?
Narcissa: Yes. In some instances where it took a very long time for the Veela to find and claim her mate, the mate had already started a family with someone else. It's very rare, as the mate of a Veela usually instinctively knows that they belong to someone already. I've never heard of a young Veela's mate having already been claimed by another. Are you quite sure? Perhaps you are mistaken.
Draco: She has a boyfriend.
Narcissa: Oh! Well if that's all, you can steal her away with a very minimum of difficulty. Her soul is matched to yours and the heart will follow.
Draco: It's not that easy, Mother. Even if I told her she was my mate—
Narcissa: Oh no, you mustn't do that. It will eventually become easily apparent that you are a Veela, but you cannot tell her she's your mate. It's extremely important that she come to you entirely of her own free will.
Draco: I know, but I'm saying that even if I told her, even her do-gooder heart wouldn't feel inclined to be my mate simply to save me from a lifetime of loneliness."
12,10741320,Draco,Draco's Veela,"Draco: Mother? Your grandmother always said I would destroy this family. She urged Lucius not to marry me. He may have been my mate, but he didn’t have to choose me. Or he could have mated me and still married another to bear his heir, someone of truly pure wizarding blood.
Draco's Veela: *protested* How unthinkable! To share one’s mate seemed like it would be an even worse fate than not knowing or not having.
Draco: Like my family, they kept the secret of the Veela blood, hoping that they could keep their pureblood status untarnished. But she never let me forget that I was less than pure, less than ideal. Even her portrait used to hiss at me sometimes in the corridors that I had tainted the Malfoy family line. That my Veela blood indicated the beginning of the end of the prestigious Malfoy family lineage. I never wanted to believe that.
Draco's Veela: Mother, that’s ridiculous! Your pureblood lineage is just as pure as father’s. The Veela blood only makes it more magical.
Draco: *half-smiled* But your mate’s is not.
Draco: What’s done is done. It’s certainly not your fault that your mate is not a pureblood. Although I’d tried to… *trailed off* Not enough, I suppose.
Draco: *thought about her words* How a Veela chose a mate? Was it simply fated from birth? Was there a binding that had happened and he’d missed it? Was there even a choice?
Narcissa: *looked at him with steady eyes* There is no sure formula, but it is believed that a Veela’s preference is taken into account. It is extremely rare that a Veela is mated to a person they’ve never met or interacted with before. It’s much more common that Veela mate with someone who they’ve expressed strong feelings for."
13,10741320,Draco,Draco's mother,"Draco: Itâ€™s not as simple as perhaps feeling the blossoming of youthful love. If that were true, every Veela would be mated to her first crush, or her first boyfriend. A Veela mating is a true match of the soul but spending time with someone and growing together is much more likely to yield a compatible mate than someone completely unknown. When I was mated to your father, it seemed to me a bit like there were threads spun between us. There was a web of strings connecting me to everyone. Some for good, some for bad. The Veela responds to passion and excitement, which is sometimes like love and sometimes like hate; the two are not as far apart as people often think. But over the years as we spoke and talked and fought and flirted, more and more threads connected me to my Lucius. *she smiled as she remembered those early days at Hogwarts* And when my Veela finally awoke, it wasnâ€™t long at all before I realized that he was the one for me. Convincing him took a little bit longer, but I think heâ€™d always known what was growing between us.
Draco's mother: *there was a sheen in her eyes as she spoke of her husband that caused a little catch in Dracoâ€™s throat* His Veela crooned softly, a minty green expression of grief for his father and for his motherâ€™s loneliness.
Draco: *later, as he laid awake missing the sound of his mateâ€™s heartbeat* He understood now why sheâ€™d always pushed him to build relationships with the pureblood girls at school. Beyond the regular designs of a pureblood mother, the Veela mother was trying to direct her sonâ€™s choice of a mate. Sheâ€™d hoped if he spent time with Pansy or Millicent or Tracy, heâ€™d develop a tie to one of them. And sheâ€™d hoped if she avoided discussion about any of the young women who were not appropriate choices, that they could avoid his Veela spinning â€˜threadsâ€™ of closeness to anyone without the proper blood status. *how strange that the very girl who was at the bottom of his motherâ€™s list was the one that his Veela had chosen! He felt a tiny bit of guilt. His mother had been counting on him to continue the Malfoy traditions, despite the Veela blood that ran through his veins. Somehow heâ€™d chosen the very girl to break them all.*
Draco: *he searched into the night for her heartbeat, thinking about her suddenly making him miss her something terrible* But no matter how far he stretched his senses, it wasnâ€™t enough for him to find her. There was just blackness, with the occasional pinpricks of light, but nothing like the bright beacon that usually called to him.
Draco: *he thought back through all of the years they spent at Hogwarts together* From the very first day when heâ€™d seen her bushy head, heâ€™d felt something. It was something like irritation. Especially when classes began and she was constantly raising her swotty hand and not allowing anyone else even half of a chance to answer the professorsâ€™ questions. That buzzing, tickling feeling kept pushing him to do something. Heâ€™d yelled at her, hexed her, made fun of her, pranked her mercilessly, and never once stopped to ask himself why."
14,10741320,Draco,Draco's mother,"Draco: Everything is just so empty. I miss her so much. I feel like I might die without her.
Draco's mother: Nonsense! You won't die.
Draco: How do you live with it?
Draco's mother: You still have hope, Draco. She is out there waiting for you to win her.
Draco: She's not waiting for me, she has someone already."
15,10741320,Narcissa,Draco,"Narcissa: She's not waiting for me, she has someone already, *tut-tutted* She has someone. But he's not the other half of her soul. She'll realize it soon, and the strings that bind you together will soon be clear to her. You need to be patient and not give up so soon. You are a Malfoy after all, and she cannot do better.
Draco: I think that's probably a point against me. I have done little to recommend myself to her, *cringed* And she has no use for the status of the old families.
Narcissa: *laughed quietly* That she has feelings for you at all is only to your benefit. It is much easier to woo a girl who has given you attention than it is one who has never noticed you.
Draco: *sighed* She's noticed me all right.
Narcissa: It does take a bit longer when you need to win her respect in addition to her love. But you have plenty of time, my son. And you have the advantage of knowing her like no one else ever could.
Draco: *thought on that as he chewed* It was true that he could sense things about her, from her heartbeat and from his Veela's color senses, but he didn't know how knowing those things could help him.
Narcissa: Insight into your beloved is a wonderful gift, and a great advantage when courting, *sensing his doubts* I will teach you. You must learn not just how to use your Veela senses, but how to control that part of yourself. It is clear you've allowed your Veela to overwhelm you, something common among young Veela. But while you are here, we will practice and strengthen your control and your understanding.
Narcissa: *nodded as she called a house elf to clear Draco's now empty plate* When you've learned to accept all the parts of yourself, it will be that much easier for your mate to see and accept you for who you are."
16,10741320,Draco,Hermione Granger,"Draco: The return back to Hogwarts after the holidays caused Draco conflicting reactions. On the one hand, his Veela was anxious and excited to be back within the vicinity of his mate. On the other hand, the intolerable situation of his mate being romantically involved with another was making him feel sick to his stomach. He didnâ€™t know how he was supposed to get through school and just act normally as if his entire future wasnâ€™t being hijacked by a freckly-faced Weasel. *descriptions of Draco's feelings*
Draco: His mother refused to give up hope. She was convinced that his mate would come around, although he still hadnâ€™t consented to give her the girlâ€™s identity. He imagined that if she knew his mate was the one and only Hermione Granger, Muggle-born extraordinaire, she would feel very differently. She might even appreciate why Draco spent most of the hols lying abed imagining all the ways he was going to live and die alone and unloved. He didnâ€™t see how it could be any other way. *descriptions of Draco's thoughts*
Draco: Perhaps if he hadnâ€™t spent their school years purposely making life a misery for Hermione and her Gryffindor friends, there might have been a tiny bit of a chance for him. Like maybe if he hadnâ€™t slipped that extra pinch of ground up flobberworm into her cauldron during exams in fifth year, causing it to explode, and causing her to almost fail a Potions class. And maybe if he hadnâ€™t hexed her teeth to grow enormously large in front of the entire school during second year. And maybe if he hadnâ€™t said her name with a sneer every time it had crossed his lips during the last six years. And especially maybe if he hadnâ€™t called her that dirty M-word during third year. Never mind that he never used it again, and that he regretted it almost immediately and not just because she had punched him square in the face. Heâ€™d never even told his mother about that episode because he rather thought sheâ€™d be ashamed of such uncouth behavior. *descriptions of Draco's regrets and actions towards Hermione*
Draco: Yes, maybe if it wasnâ€™t for those things, maybe then heâ€™d have something he could work with. *descriptions of Draco's thoughts*
Draco: Instead, he was sitting on the train in the prefectsâ€™ cabin trying not to think about the hopelessness of his situation. *description of Draco's current situation*
Draco: And trying to ignore the fact that he knew the exact minute when she appeared in Kingâ€™s Cross. His own heart was thrumming frazzled and erratic, anxiety over seeing her again causing him to breathe unevenly. Then suddenly her heartbeat was there, a bit faster than normal, as she was clearly excited about returning to school. The echo of it filled his heart, drowning out the feelings of mild distress, and calming him. *descriptions of Draco's feelings and connection to Hermione*
Draco: Since recognizing her the night of the Yule ball, it seemed his connection to her had grown stronger. He could almost feel her moving through the cabins. If he closed his eyes, he imagined heâ€™d be able to see her like a blinding light heading straight towards him. His perception of her location was unerring. *descriptions of Draco's connection to Hermione*
Draco: He looked up just a moment before she slid open the door and stepped in. *description of Draco's actions*"
17,10741320,Draco,Hermione Granger,"Draco: He learned what her fear felt like. It was a loud thrumming, like the frenzied flapping wings of a trapped bird. His Veela had been upset, squawking in his mind and frantic. His mate was afraid! She was in danger! *descriptions of Draco's emotions and actions*
Draco: If anyone noticed his sudden white-knuckled grip on his robes they never said anything. From where he was sitting he could easily see her, that she was safe, and so it took all his self-control, ropes and ropes of the blues and greens, to restrain himself from leaping to her side. And when his Veela finally settled, he took deep breaths to ward off the cloudy greys with angry red streaks that were like lightning in a storm, trying to ignore the fact that his mate was distressed over another man.
Draco: One night, he was lying in bed trying to will himself to fall asleep when her heart tapped out a completely new rhythm. It was still a bit earlier than his normal bedtime, but he was tired and exhausted from all of his pretending during the day. Pretending he wasn't watching Hermione Granger. Pretending he was still the same person that he'd been before. Pretending that seeing her with the Weasel every day wasn't tearing a hole into him.
Draco: But he couldn't sleep until she had gone to bed. It was her turn to patrol, and she was out doing rounds with Susan Bones. Her heart normally beat the patterns of a brisk walk, punctuated with the occasional irritation.
Draco: But this night his eyes shot open as her heart began pounding hard and fast. It was going so fast he didn't see how any oxygen could be getting to her brain. His Veela was not unduly distressed, but it was alert and demanding some kind of action, and he was on his feet before he realized it.
Draco: He had enough presence of mind to put a shirt on along with his trousers, and then he was standing outside of the dungeons wondering if he was acting crazy. But her heartbeat hadn't slowed. It was irregular and all over the place, loud and hammering in his mind.
Draco: He had no idea what he was doing. He knew where she was, up a level, and several corridors to the west. But what was he supposed to do, just come running up to her and asking why her heart was beating so fast? He couldn't do that, it was ridiculous. He ought to just turn around and march back down to his lonely little dungeon.
Draco: But what if she was in trouble? What if there was something wrong? Even if he had no right to come rushing to her side, he didn't see how he could possibly stand there so far away while she was in danger.
Draco: His feet were moving before he realized he'd finished convincing himself. He just barely managed to slow down before he approached the dark corner that he knew she was behind.
Draco: The shock of what he saw reverberated all the way down into his toes. His mate was up against a wall, her wand arm limp at her side while a large body held her immobile. His Veela screamed angry and murderous scarlets and crimsons that only he could hear."
18,10741320,Draco,Hermione,"Draco: The shock of what he saw reverberated all the way down into his toes. His mate was up against a wall, her wand arm limp at her side while a large body held her immobile. His Veela screamed angry and murderous scarlets and crimsons that only he could hear. *realizing it was Weasley engaging Granger in a rather passionate snog did nothing to appease his Veela, who only screamed more agitatedly in anger and rage* The need to feel Weasel's blood running down his fingertips was overwhelming, but he was becoming a master of self-control and it was clear that she was in no danger from her boyfriend. And, as he'd suspected, he had no right to come rushing to her side. *he lowered his wand, and tried to leave before they saw him, overruling the Veela's driving desire to take his mate and fly away* But perhaps she'd sensed something, because there was a squeak as the couple suddenly disengaged. *as he moved to turn the corner and flee back to his dungeon, her eyes flashed to his for an instant*

Draco: Later, as he lay in bed, a pillow over his face as if it could block out what he'd seen, he tried to ignore the feeling of her eyes on him, and the way he'd felt her heart jump when she'd seen him, probably scared and embarrassed to have been caught snogging her boyfriend while she was supposed to be on patrol. *but he still couldn't sleep until she'd returned safely back to her dorm and her heart settled into its nightly rhythms* It was only a small consolation that he didn't feel that rapid, capricious pulsing again.

Draco: The next time it happened, he'd had a little more practice at sussing out her moods. He was beginning to think he could discern a little about how she felt beyond just that beating of her heart with which he was now intimately familiar. *one day in Potions he'd noticed how she'd forgotten to add one of her ingredients. Carefully chopped up and set aside, it was half-hidden by her cauldron. She'd find it as she was cleaning up, but by the time she did, she'd be too late to add it in before the potion bubbled* If you're not going to use all those bloodroot leaves, Granger, you might as well give 'em here. It'll only make mine stronger. *her embarrassment had been amber and olive green as her eyes opened wide and she realized her mistake* Quickly fixing it, her heart set a rapid clipping pace as she waited to see if she was too late. When it was clear the crisis had passed, her confusion had been a bright cornflower blue mottled with peachy pinks, as she observed him out of the corner of her eyes. He pretended not to notice.

Draco: The afternoon he'd seen the 2nd year with the big bag again, he hadn't realized Hermione was watching till he sensed her amusement drifting by on clouds of lavender and magenta. *the girl had tripped and Draco had once again helped her with her books* When she'd looked up at him..."
19,10741320,Draco,Hermione,"Draco: The afternoon heâ€™d seen the 2nd year with the big bag again, he hadnâ€™t realized Hermione was watching till he sensed her amusement drifting by on clouds of lavender and magenta. The girl had tripped and Draco had once again helped her with her books. When sheâ€™d looked up at him, her swotty self and long curly hair so like his own mate, heâ€™d taken pity on her and cast a stabilizing charm on her bag so it wouldnâ€™t overbalance her again. And thatâ€™s when heâ€™d felt the eyes on him, and saw the streaks of color on the air, and felt the light tripping of her heart and her breathing that told him she was laughing even though he couldnâ€™t hear her.
Hermione: *tripped and Draco had once again helped her with her books* Thank you, Draco.

Draco: And when the prefects got the news that the Head Girlâ€™s pet projectâ€”a Career Day hosted for the 5th years and aboveâ€”had been moved up an entire month, heâ€™d felt her anxiety as snowy greys and strong sea greens. The announcement straight from Dumbledore had caused her heart to stutter and her breathing to grow shallow; he could feel each dragging breath in his lungs. But when heâ€™d looked at her in alarm, sheâ€™d just responded with assurance to the headmaster that of course they would be ready.
Hermione: *responded with assurance to the headmaster* Of course we will be ready, Professor Dumbledore.

Draco: During the last-minute evening organizational sessions, he could always tell when she was feeling overwhelmed by the complicated decorations or the changing layout of the Great Hall to accommodate each representativeâ€™s unique magical requirements. So he would find a way to insert himself into the conversation, tell Hermione heâ€™d take care of it, review the situation, and then cut out the unnecessary time-consuming preparations in favor of what was really needed. The first couple of times she objected to his heavy-handed maneuvering, but as the project quickly took shape, she began to look over at him when it was clear she had a task that required better supervision. He learned her relief and her gratitude were pale pastels of buttercream and honeydew.
Hermione: *looked over at him* Draco, I think we should stick to the original plan.

Draco: When the Career Day went off without a hitch, and the excited students walked off chattering about how great the event was, her pride and excitement were sparks of fuchsia, plum, and cherry red.
Hermione: *excitedly* That was amazing, Draco! Everything went perfectly!

Draco: So yes, he was beginning to know what all of her moods felt likeâ€”the colors, the rhythm of her heart, the pattern of her breathing.
No engagement.

Draco: When all of those things suddenly changed forcefully late one night, he jolted up out of his bed where heâ€™d been lightly dozing waiting for her to return from her patrol so he could settle into sleep. Her heart was a slamming drum, her breathing was ragged with gasps like there were breaks where she wasnâ€™t breathing. He thought she might be screaming, but an unpleasant memory in the back of his mind suggested maybe she wasnâ€™t breathing because her mouth was occupied with Ron Weasleyâ€™s again.
No engagement.

Draco: The dungeons were too far away from where she was in her rounds for him to see the tell-tale colors, and he hesitated, deliberating with himself on whether he should run out after her again, after what had happened last time.
No engagement.

Draco: But his Veela was becoming more and more distressed; he could almost feel his mouth hard and sharp like a snapping beak and phantom wings at his back. The agitation was just too much for him and he was up and out of the room before heâ€™d had time for anymore doubts.
No engagement."
20,10741320,Draco,Hermione,"Draco: *charged at the giant with a yell and the fury of a Veela defending his mate* Hermione! Are you okay? Where's your wand?
Hermione: Malfoy, don't! He's just a child!
Draco: Hermione! *shouted, the concern for his mate squeezing his heart* Are you okay? Where's your wand?
Hermione: *answer drowned out by the wail from the giant*
Draco: *unable to reach Hermione due to the pounding of the giant*"
21,10741320,Hermione,Draco,"Hermione: Try a body bind! *called out to him*
Draco: *quickly cast the spell* Hermione!
Hermione: *tumbled over the debris on the ground* Hermione!
Draco: *climbed over the body of the giant* Hermione?
Hermione: *looked up at a point over his shoulders* Are those...wings, Malfoy?
Draco: *felt his heart stop* Hermione!
Hermione: *eyes rolled closed*
Draco: *gathered her in his arms* Pomfrey's office.
Mediwitch: Mr Malfoy! *exclaimed, shocked*
Draco: *pointed over his shoulder* A giant.
Draco: *gasped out* She hit...her head.
Mediwitch: A giant in the castle? I must notify the Headmaster at once!
Draco: *told her the location of the giant*"
22,10741320,Dumbledore,Draco,"Dumbledore: Merlin, *said under her breath*
Dumbledore: Mr Malfoy, *approaching him slowly as if he were a wild creature* Are you quite all right, Draco?
Draco: I—yes, I'm fine, *asserted* It's Hermione, she was injured.
Dumbledore: Yes, we heard. Young Grawp caused quite the mess, but he has been returned safely to his family and will not be causing trouble here at Hogwarts again. Miss Granger appears to be safe now, though.
Draco: *nodded, his hand still clenched tightly around Hermione's*
McGonagall: Poppy says that Miss Granger will be perfectly fine, and will likely wake soon, *offered*
Dumbledore: Draco, *soft and coaxing* Draco, don't you think it's time to put the wings away?
Draco: What? *shocked, vaguely remembering Hermione's words before she had fallen unconscious*
McGonagall: *quickly transfigured a large mirror for him, and held it suspended where he could see*"
23,10741320,McGonagall,Draco,"McGonagall: Draco, I assume your mother has revealed some family secrets to you recently.
Draco: She didn't say anything about wings. Am I-Is this...normal? For a male Veela?
McGonagall: Merlin, a male Veela.
Snape: No. But male Veela are extremely rare, and one of diluted Veela blood that can manifest physical Veela traits is also extremely rare. So there may be little record of others.
Draco: I think she saw them. Before-before she- After she was hit in the head. I think she saw them. Do you suppose she would know what that meant?
McGonagall: Well, she is very smart. She may well figure it out on her own. Perhaps you should tell her yourself.
Draco: No! I can't tell her! I can't take her choice away!"
24,10741320,Snape,McGonagall,"Snape: No! I can't tell her! I can't take her choice away!
McGonagall: *exchanged a knowing glance*
Dumbledore: *kept looking at him, his expression kind and a slight smile on his face* No, Mr Malfoy, of course not. All in its own time. You can trust us to remain discreet while you finish your courtship of Miss Granger.
Draco: *relieved to hear that* But Draco, if you don't want her to learn of your true nature, perhaps you should put the wings away now.
Draco: I don't know how. I don't know how they came out in the first place.
Snape: *provided the answer* Veela respond to intense emotional circumstances. You were no doubt worried over your mate's safety, and the Veela protective instinct manifested. But she is clearly safe now. Perhaps if you concentrate on those feelings of safety and security you can control the Veela's distress.
Draco: *remembered the lessons with his mother on controlling his Veela emotions* He still held Hermione's hand in his, something he hadn't had when he'd practiced before. He closed his eyes to concentrate on the feel of her warm skin. The flow of her blood beat gently against his palm, and he drew out the sound of her heartbeat from the corner of his mind to magnify it. It was strong and steady, and the sound of it drew his own heartbeat into a matching rhythm. He called to mind the exact hues of golds and pinks that made him think of her as vibrant and strong and happy, and he could tell he was growing calmer. He reminded himself and his Veela that she was safe and that he'd saved her.
Dumbledore: *praised him* Very good, Mr Malfoy. And just in time. If I'm not mistaken, Miss Granger's friends are due here any moment.
Draco: *reluctantly let go of Hermione's hand*"
25,10741320,Draco,Hermione,"Draco: As if his words conjured them, Draco could hear the raised voices of Potter and Weasley outside the door, and he reluctantly let go of Hermione’s hand. He’d just stepped away when the two Gryffindors came tumbling in, frantic for the safety of their friend. *reluctantly let go of Hermione's hand*
Weasley: The redheaded one went straight to her bedside, taking the hand Draco had just released, apologies spilling out of his mouth. *took the hand Draco had just released*
Draco: It was all Draco could do to restrain the sudden hissing fury of his Veela at seeing another man touch his mate when she was wounded. *restrain the sudden hissing fury of his Veela*
Snape: The sharp look Snape gave him made it clear that he needed to leave before he did anything to jeopardize his secret. *gave him a sharp look*
Weasley: “It’s all my fault,” Weasley moaned, “We’d had a fight and she left to patrol without me. I wasn’t going to make her go alone, but I was mad, and I was late…” *moaned*
Draco: The Gryffindor’s voice trailed off into words that Draco couldn’t hear over the violent squawking sounds in his head. *couldn't hear over the violent squawking sounds in his head*
Snape: Before he realized it, Snape had forcibly grabbed him by the arm, and manhandled him to just outside the door. The force in the Potions professor’s fingers as they clamped hard onto his forearm were belied by the calm, low voice with which he warned, “Control, Draco. Your temper will spark a certain fire if you are not careful.” *forcibly grabbed him by the arm* *warned him to control his temper*
Draco: With visible effort, Draco drew his eyes away from the room where his mate lay. He shook with the need to return to her side, but he knew his presence would be unwelcome and difficult to explain to her friends, or even to her if she should wake while he was there. *drew his eyes away from the room where his mate lay*
Snape: “Come, I will walk you back to the dungeons,” Snape ordered. “It seems we have much to discuss.” The vice-like grip on his arm didn’t loosen until they were well on their way. *ordered him to walk back to the dungeons*"
26,10741320,Hermione,Draco,"Hermione: Trouble in Paradise? *clammed up and stopped talking*
Draco: None of your business, Malfoy! *brushing an imaginary speck of lint off his robes*
Draco: Oh, don't mind me at all! But if it's not everyone's business, then I might suggest not shouting it out for everyone to hear. Even though I know loud and uncouth is your family's preferred method of communication.
Ron: *growled and took a step towards Draco*
Hermione: Malfoy, I'd appreciate it if you gave us some privacy. And Ron and I will take this discussion somewhere else, so we don't disturb anyone else.
Ron: There's nothing left to discuss, Hermione!
Hermione: *protested* Ron...
Draco: *finally turned around to leave*
Draco: *glared at Ron*
Draco: *walked away and made it a point not to look back at the couple in the middle of their argument*
Draco: *upset that he couldn't do anything to alleviate her distress*
Draco: *upset that he couldn't have just stayed in his dorm and followed Snape's advice to not get involved*
Hermione: *breathing ragged and shallow, crying and taking little sobbing breaths*"
27,10741320,Hermione,Draco,"Hermione: What do you want, Malfoy?
Draco: *worried for a moment that she could sense him* I don't really want company right now.
Hermione: *with the stiff politeness she often adopted around him* I'm sure Weasley will come around, Granger. I've seen far worse fights than that.
Draco: Actually, Malfoy, we broke up. And I don't want to talk about it.
Draco: *snorted derisively, and shook his head* Weasley is such a fool.
Hermione: *exasperated sigh*"
28,10741320,Malfoy,Weasley,"Malfoy: Weasley is such a fool.
Hermione: Not that it's any of your business, Malfoy, but I broke up with him.
Malfoy: Well, they all say you're the brightest witch of the age.
Hermione: I told you I didn't want to talk about it, Malfoy.
Malfoy: How's the head?
Malfoy: Really?
Hermione: My head is fine. Pomfrey healed it, and I took a couple of potions for the first few days just in case, but she said there was no lasting damage.
Hermione: I heard you took me to the medical ward after the problem with Grawp. And that you stayed with me until my friends arrived."
29,10741320,Draco,Grawp,"Draco: Is Grawp the name of that oaf who was intent on bringing down the castle that night?
Hermione: Yes, Grawp is Hagrid's brother. I had no idea he had a brother, and he wasn't supposed to bring him to the castle. But Grawp got out and went exploring. I think I scared him when I jumped out with my wand.
Draco: You scared him?
Hermione: He's really quite nice once you get to know him, if a little... high-spirited.
Draco: I'll pass, thanks.
Hermione: I never got to say thank you.
Draco: I didn't bring it up for your thanks, Granger.
Hermione: No, I know. But I should have thanked you earlier. For finding me and for helping me with Grawp.
Draco: *feeling a little awkward* They found my wand under his foot. That explains why it didn't come when I called it. He must have stepped on it after it was knocked out of my hand.
Draco: Keep your wand on you, Granger. I won't always be around to rescue you."
30,10741320,Draco,Hermione,"Draco: Keep your wand on you, Granger. I won't always be around to rescue you. *almost managed the tone of voice that he used to tease her with*
Draco: Merlin, forbid! *exaggerated a shudder*
Hermione: It was a one-time thing, Malfoy. I'm sure no one expects you to play hero again.
Draco: You thought I looked like an angel, Granger? A heavenly rescuer?
Draco: No, Malfoy, I just thought I saw— *stopped by Draco's grin*
Hermione: Oh, never mind!
Hermione: Malfoy— *about to say something*
Draco: *reaches over with his hand to catch the locks of hair before they fell back down*"
31,10741320,Draco,Her,"Draco: Why do you have this? *he asked, hearing the slightest quiver in his voice, and hoping she wouldn't notice.*
Her: Oh, that. It's a souvenir of the accident. Pomfrey said it wasn't unusual in stressful situations, especially blows to the head, for hair to magically whiten. *She shrugged.*
Draco: *nodded at her as if Pomfrey had given her a reasonable explanation.*
Draco: *He didn't know if he liked that, seeing her change, knowing she had no idea that it was because of him.*
Draco: *Thinking that the Veela charm or the Veela mate bond that was even now spinning stronger between them would eventually force her into his arms made him want to howl with guilt and shame.*
Draco: *He didn't want a mate who was forced or compelled, who couldn't resist the pull of the Veela. He wanted a mate who would love him for who he was, both man and Veela.*
Draco: *The feeling of fate crashing down on them both took him by surprise. Her magic was changing to match his, but he didn't know what to do next. He didn't know what he could do to win her heart before she found out the truth and despised him for it. And he didn't like the sudden feeling that everything was out of his control.*
Her: Draco, are you all right? *she heard her say, the concern evident in her voice.*
Draco: *But he just made an excuse and made his exit, anxious to leave before he revealed too much.*"
32,10741320,Hermione,Draco,"Hermione: Draco, are you all right? *concern evident in her voice*
Draco: *makes an excuse and makes his exit*

Draco: *avoids Hermione for the next several days*
Hermione: *watches Draco from across the classroom, considering look on her face*
Draco: *feels a jolt in his heart upon seeing the tell-tale streak in Hermione's hair*
Hermione's friends: They let you into the Old Witches Society early on account of how smart you are?
Hermione's friends: No, it's on account of how much she nags!
Hermione: Well, I wouldn't have to nag you so much, Harry, if you'd just do your homework properly like you're supposed to.
Harry: Yes, Granny.
Hermione: Oh! You prat! I'm going to let Ginny be the one to keep you in line from now on.
Harry: Don't put that on me, I barely keep up with my own work!
Hermione: If you must know, it's so that Grawp thinks I'm older than he is, and he respects me.
Harry: Haha, that's great! We should go see Grawp!
Hermione: Yes, let's!"
33,10741320,Draco,Granger,"Draco: When he saw his own name on the prefects list to patrol with Granger, he quietly asked for Zabini to cover for him, citing a previous meeting with Snape as his advisor. He knew Zabini wouldnâ€™t doubt him, and his godfather would uphold the story if asked. But he didnâ€™t think he could spend the whole evening with the Head Girl and her prying eyes and her insatiable curiosity.
Draco: So when late one night he felt her heart rate jolt and then start pounding rapidly, he once again considered not leaving the comfortable isolation of his dormitory to track her down.
Draco: But there was something confusing about the situation. Her heart rate stayed elevated with sudden hard slams, but her breathing seemed unpredictable and her emotions were all over the place. He felt streaks of what felt like fear and concern, followed by what might have been amusement or nervousness. He took several moments trying to make sense of what could possibly be happening to Granger late at night when she wasnâ€™t even supposed to be patrolling.
Draco: A quick close of his eyes and a search for the thread of light that linked him to her, and he located her in the castle in the same place where theyâ€™d had their misbegotten fight against Hagridâ€™s runty brother.
Draco: The location startled him enough to get up in anticipation of leaving. But then he felt a true jolt of terror streak through her emotions and he thought she might have been screaming.
Draco: He made it out of the dungeons and down the corridors in no time, uncertain of what he would find, still confused by the mixed signals he seemed to be getting.
Draco: Granger was standing against the wall, her wand thankfully in her hand, and aimed at where the Acromantula had been. He was beside her in a flash, checking her for injury.
Draco: â€œWhat happened? What was that?â€� His hands came up to cradle her face, examining it carefully for injury. He checked all over for signs of blood. Her eyes watching him were big and confused, but otherwise she was fine."
34,10741320,Hermione,Character 1,"Hermione: You came. *staring at him*
Character 1: I heard sounds and came rushing to see what was happening. Getting yourself into some kind of trouble again? One magic fight in this corner of the castle wasn't enough?
Hermione: You walked right through the concealment charms and the Notice-Me-Nots like you knew exactly where you were going.
Character 1: What's going on, Granger?
Hermione: I wondered if you would come. I thought...maybe...if I recreated that night...
Character 1: I don't know what you're involved in, Granger. If you're done playing games, you should go off to bed."
35,10741320,Draco,Hermione,"Draco: I don't know what you're involved in, Granger. If you're done playing games, you should go off to bed. *shakes head at the toy pieces still lying on the floor, and made to walk away*
Hermione: You feel sad. *says it quietly, the look in her eyes questioning* Draco, why is it that I can feel when you're sad?
Draco: What? *turns back to look at her again*
Hermione: I can feel it. *says it quietly, the look in her eyes questioning* Draco, why is it that I can feel when you're sad?
Draco: I don't feel sad, *denied* I haven't been able to figure it out. Sometimes I turn, and you're there. Or I feel your presence before you arrive. I tried to convince myself that I was being silly. I was making up a connection that wasn't there because you'd rescued me, and I couldn't make sense of it. I was sure I was imagining it. *rambling description followed by a short, deliberate breath* But you came.
Hermione: Am I? *asks, quietly, her tone somehow vulnerable like his answer held a power over her* Am I just imagining this?
Draco: *sighs, and looks at her waiting for his answer* No, Hermione..."
36,10741320,Draco,Malfoy,"Draco: Oh, good! Malfoy, you're here. *sidestepped around him and delicately placed her burden on the edge of the desk before sliding it across the surface to a more stable position* Working on a project, Granger? An extra-credit assignment? For which class?
Hermione: Of course not, Malfoy. *waved her hand at the books on the table* I'm trying to research what happened to us.
Draco: There are the books on Legilimency, *pointed at the bundle of booklets he'd already seen* But I've already looked through those, and I really don't think our experience is similar to how that spell works.
Hermione: You know, the part where you can find me when I'm in danger, *said* The part where I can read your feelings.
Draco: *laughed dismissively* We generally call that 'body language,' Granger. It doesn't require mind."
37,10741320,Draco,Hermione,"Draco: We have a connection, you and I. And somehow that leads to me being able to read your mind and what you're feeling. *laughs dismissively at her assertion* We generally call that 'body language,' Granger. It doesn't require mind-reading skills to figure out what's on the mind of a teenage boy.
Hermione: *scoffs at him, obviously unsure why he was being so difficult* Except I know that's not what you're thinking about.
Draco: *leans forward on the table, allowing his eyes to flick downwards and then travel leisurely back up to her face* No? *allows some of those pinks and deep purples to bleed through their Veela connection* Reading my mind, Granger? *his voice is a bit darker, a bit more playful* You must be on to something, then. That's quite the connection we've got. And it looks like your books taught you quite a bit in such a short amount of time. *reaches over to grab the big, ancient book, his arm casually brushing hers in the process* I ought to check this out, I suppose, see if I can figure out what's going on in that big brain of yours.
Hermione: *looks at him deeply, distracted*"
38,10741320,Draco,Hermione,"Draco: You've got a smudge just there on your nose, Granger.
Hermione: Come to bother me again, Malfoy?
Draco: I get you bothered, Granger?
Hermione: That's not what I meant. And of course you do not.
Draco: Still working on that mind-reading thing? I did read that last book. It was fascinating, if a little outdated once the skill of Legilimency had been developed.
Hermione: Yes, I thought perhaps I needed to look at older magic and some of the skills and traits that Legilimency had built upon.
Draco: And where did that get you?"
39,10741320,Draco,Hermione,"Draco: Well, *she answered his question*, I don't think they are remotely similar. Mind-reading as an early innate skill eventually developed into the skilled and teachable forms of Legilimency, but they still only focus on thoughts and not emotions. You might say emotions are more from the heart, rather than the mind. So heart-reading might be a better way to describe it.
Hermione: And have you found anything on this heart-reading?
Hermione: That's just it, Malfoy, *she said, excitedly*, I thought that at first, too, but I haven't found anything to support that idea. Magically whitening hair, yes. Emotional sensitivities lasting significantly beyond the 'traumatic magical experience', no.
Draco: I don't have any emotional sensitivities, Granger. *He lied about their connection again*. He almost thought it was getting easier."
40,10741320,Draco,Hermione,"Draco: I don’t have any emotional sensitivities, Granger. *lied about their connection again* You know what I mean. I have emotions. I just don’t have whatever you’re talking about.
Hermione: *giggled into her hand* Actually, I don’t know what you mean. Why don’t you describe the events as you remember them, and the days afterward? Then we can compare our symptoms.
Draco: *described the rescue from Grawp in vague terms* I could feel you watching me.
Hermione: *frowned as she looked down at her notes* Were you watching me, Granger?
Draco: *laughed* I don’t recall the particular moments you are talking about.
Hermione: What are you going to do after school?
Draco: *didn't answer right away*"
41,10741320,Draco,Hermione,"Draco: I see, *was all she said*. And then she was gone, head high in the air, and Draco didn't dare stop into her library sanctuary again.
Draco: *He didn't have to wonder long about what progress she was making in her research.* One afternoon, in their shared History of Magic class, he walked in and felt her staring straight at him. Though he was always hyper aware of her presence, there was something particularly intense about her gaze, as if she was deliberately daring him to look at her.
Draco: *When he did, he didn't see anything out of the ordinary.* She sat neatly as she normally did, her parchment and quill out on the table, ready to take notes she didn't need. There was slightly less room on her desk, as there were a couple of books sitting on the edge of it. The spines were turned outwards so he could see them clearly, even from where he was across the room.
Draco: *He glanced at the titles and scowled.* Blood Connections Vol 2: Effects of Light & Dark Magic was a thick blue book, whereas Magical Creatures & Their Magical Blood was a slim volume with red lettering.
Draco: *He took a breath and looked away*, unwilling to let her see that the titles had ruffled him. She was sending him a message that her research would not be stopped, and it would not be delayed by his unwillingness to help.
Draco: *For the rest of the class he was careful not to look her way*, though he felt her eyes on him.
Parvati Patil: Were we supposed to bring books today, Hermione?
Draco: *He didn't look at the two Gryffindors as he walked over to his seat at his desk.* But he heard her answer.
Hermione: Oh no, just some extra reading I'm doing at the moment.
Parvati Patil: A Comparative Analysis of the Anatomy of Giants, Veela, Werewolves and Centaurs. What in Merlin's name would you need that for?
Hermione: Oh, you never know.
Draco: *He pretended he didn't notice the books*, but his heart was hammering in his chest. She was too smart. Too focused. Too relentless. He rather thought he loved that about her, but it scared him. He could hear the ticking of a clock that told him his time was running short. What would the books say about Veela and their mating procedures? What would she think when she discovered evidence that pointed at him being Veela? What would she think when the evidence pointed at her as being his mate?"
42,10741320,Draco,Veela,"Draco: What would the books say about Veela and their mating procedures? What would she think when she discovered evidence that pointed at him being Veela? What would she think when the evidence pointed at her as being his mate? The thoughts made him sick. She would be disgusted at worst, disdainful at best. He’d barely managed an almost-friendship with her over the last couple of months, and even that nebulous foundation was shaky. He wasn’t sure if he’d ruined it with his flippant and rude comment.
Draco: At night, he listened to her heartbeat and told himself that the next day he would make an effort to talk to her, to get her to give him the chance to prove himself as more than just the bully he’d been for most of her time at Hogwarts. There was still time for him to gain a little of her regard. But each day he found he didn’t have the courage to face her. What if she’d already figured it out? What if she looked at him like a curious lesson from her Magical Creatures class? What if she looked at him with loathing or revulsion, and told him never to speak to her again? Or worse, what if she looked at him with pity, because she was determined that she would never—could never—bring herself to accept him as her mate?
Draco: He had an idea of what the books contained before the titles confirmed it for him. Veela & Their Mates: Half-Breeds Among Us was the title on the topmost book, an alarming orange and yellow color. But that title wasn’t quite as worrisome as the other one with the glossy black binding: Resisting Veela Charms. He knew it. She hated him.
Draco: He couldn’t stop the surge of emotion that swamped him. It was spotty and sludgy, a thick leaden grey that covered him and threatened to drag him downwards. He didn’t remember what else happened in class, though he made a show of taking notes, seemingly unaffected. But if anyone had happened to look at what he’d written, they would just see nonsense words and symbols.
Draco: It was silly for him to be upset. He’d known it was impossible from the very beginning. There was just too much between them for her to look at him as anything other than the spoiled, rich prat who had teased her and mocked her for years. And he was too much of a coward to step out and make her see him differently.
Draco: It occurred to him that he probably should have tried something from a traditional courtship. He could have sent her flowers. Or better, he could have sent her books. Books about Ve..."
43,10741320,character_name,her friends,"character_name: Her eyes found his and he thought the look on her face was one of wonder, though he didnâ€™t recognize the colors that shimmered between them., *her friends were calling to her, but she wasnâ€™t paying them any attention.*
character_name: He knew that for the moment she was connected to him, that heâ€™d foolishly unguarded his feelings and they were spilling out towards her. She took a single, hesitant step towards him, and there was something that might have been uncertainty or expectation in her bearing, but he couldnâ€™t bear the tension, the embarrassment. He turned and ran. Like the night of the Yule ball, overcome with the revelation that his mate was the one girl he could never have, he ran out onto the grounds, and kept running.
character_name: When he came upon the same tree heâ€™d found that night, he familiarly swung himself up into the branches, feeling the irrational need to hide among the fresh, green foliage. He could feel her coming closer, heading straight for him as if sheâ€™d zeroed in on his location. From high up in his perch, he saw her walking briskly to the edge of the forest where she stopped almost right underneath him. The shadows played on her hair, and made it look darker than it was, while he held perfectly still.
character_name: Her head swiveled back and forth, her hands on her hips, while she looked around confused. It was obvious she was looking for him. He felt his heart thump suddenly very loudly, knowing that the moment of truth had arrived. The lines of fate had all converged upon this moment, and his heart beat so fast he found it hard to breathe.
character_name: As if she could hear his heart, and perhaps she could, she suddenly looked straight up, her brown eyes boring straight into his. He regarded her steadily, not even bothering to feel silly at being caught up a tree.
character_name: She didnâ€™t say a word as she approached the tree trunk, a look of consideration on her face. After a few moments and a couple waves of her wand, the tree trunk was now covered with evenly spaced knots of wood that led straight up into the canopy where he sat watching her.
character_name: His eyes never wavered from her as she ascended into the tree and settled herself carefully onto the branch beside him. He didnâ€™t bother objecting. The feeling was heavy around him that time and blood and magic had been leading them both to just this moment, coinciding with the two of them high up in the tree.
character_name: She swung her feet as she looked down at the grass below, and then she finally turned to him.

44,10741320,Her,Him,"Her: I can find you, you know. *turns to him* Probably the same way you found me. Those nights when you seemed to stumble upon me at just the right or the wrong moment. You were following me, weren't you? Following this...this connection that we have.
Him: *doesn't respond*
Her: If I die, you'll be free to choose another.
Him: What!
Her: *looks at his back* I knew it! None of the books mentioned wings, but I knew I had seen them.
Him: *snarls at her in distress*
Her: Relax. I'm not planning to kill myself. I'm just saying it's not nearly as hopeless as all that. I might die quite young, considering my habit of sticking my nose into other people's business. And even if I die at a regular age, it seems Veela live considerably longer than the average witch or wizard. So you see, you have only to wait me out.
Him: *still gaping at her* Stop talking about dying.
Her: I just...I know you don't want me, and you didn't choose me. *looks down at her hand* I understand. I'm not offended. I know you can't actively plot my demise, but if you hoped to just wait until I d--

Draco: *growl* Stop talking about dying!
Hermione: I'm trying to tell you that it's okay! *shouted at him, exasperated* I just meant--
Draco: I don't want you to die, Granger.

Draco: I do want to be bound to you forever. *bright white words*"

Draco: I'm a coward, I suppose.
Hermione: *frowns*
Draco: It's because I don't know what comes next.
Hermione: Well, I didn't hate you your whole life. I didn't even meet you until we were eleven."
