0,1127771,Draco,Potter,"Draco: Malfoy. *Draco returned the nod and then hurried to grab his Nimbus before Potter could escape; he was already at the exit.* What's wrong with your broom?
Potter: What? Nothing. *Potter glanced between Draco and the Firebolt in obvious panic.* You're taking the piss, Malfoy. I don't see it.
Draco: Here. *Draco took out his wand and lit it up with a quick non-verbal Lumos. Potter raised the broom closer to the light.* It has a crack, Potter. Draco stepped forward; he was standing very close now. There, on the handle.
Potter: *Potter's fingers slid over the wood with enormous care.* You're... you're right, Malfoy. I didn't notice it before.
Draco: *Draco's stomach was doing somersaults.* I was just trying to... I needed a closer look and... It was merely an accidâ€” Oh, fuck it. Fuck explanations and fuck the whole thing. Draco jumped on his broom and shot out of the shed. His wand fell to the ground in the process, but he didn't even care.
Potter: *Potter stood down in the snow, his wand pointing at Draco, pulling him in.* What was that?
Draco: *Draco imagined he could see his green eyes burn with anger.* It's Christmas, Potter. I wanted to wish you a Merry Christmas. Obviously. He forced his lips to stretch into a smile. Merry Christmas, Potter."

Draco: I, er... It's Christmas, Potter. I wanted to wish you a Merry Christmas. Obviously. *He forced his lips to stretch into a smile.* Merry Christmas, Potter. *He thumped Potter's back, as hard as their proximity allowed it, and then air-kissed both of Potter's cheeks.*
Potter: I see. *He still held Draco trapped against him; the cold has pinked his cheeks.* Well, then. *He leaned in closer; Draco held his breath.*
Potter: Merry Christmas, *Potter said. His lips were wet; he was smiling.* He released Draco and stepped back. Two flicks of his wand delivered Draco's broom and wand to his hand. Potter sure knew how to summon the things he wanted. Or maybe everything and everyone was eager to end up in his hands.
Draco: Oi! Malfoy! *Draco turned to see Potter up in the air, staring down at him with a frown.* Are we flying or what? *Potter cocked his head.* You know I'll beat you in a race. I can't believe you're giving me a head start.
Draco: I can afford it! *Draco said, with a sudden burst of energy.* He could afford it. He was sure he didn't even need a broom to fly. He jumped on his Nimbus, nonetheless, and pulled up next to Potter. Winner gets a prize, right?
Potter: Hurry up and find out, *he said and soared towards the forest.*
Draco: *Draco gripped his broom, and hurried.*"
