0,11294718,Jacob,Queenie,"Jacob: Ah, good afternoon, miss, er, ma’am, *stumbling for his words over thoughts of oh jeez and she’s a real dame and I gotta know her name.*
Queenie: Good afternoon. You wouldn’t happen to be the Mr. Kowalski whose name is on the door?
Jacob: As it happens, I am, but you can call me Jacob if you like.
Queenie: *giggles* I’m Queenie, it’s real nice to meet you.
...
Tina: Oh, Queenie, what are you doing?
Queenie: I don’t know, Teen. I just… I couldn’t help it and then I saw all his pastries… We’re in there, in his memories, somewhere.
Tina: *sighs*"
1,11294718,Tina,Queenie,"Tina: Alright, Tina says at length. She drags her hand over her face in a very Percival move and drops her arms helplessly at her sides. Just... Be careful, please.
Queenie: I'm a big girl, says Queenie.
Tina: But you're also my little sister, says Tina softly in return.

Jacob: So, I had the craziest dream last night, says Jacob, breaking the peaceful quiet that had fallen over the kitchen.
Queenie: Again? Queenie asks, teasing.
Jacob: Yeah, yeah, says Jacob, chuckling. I don't know what it is, but ever since I got my collateral, I've been having the strangest dreams.
Queenie: Your life was changed, says Queenie, as she always does when this topic comes up. Now that you're not trapped in that cannery, your imagination is going wild.
Jacob: Hm, must be, Jacob agrees easily enough, but like always, he isn't fully convinced.
Queenie: So, tell me about this crazy dream, says Queenie, pulling Jacob back to a kinder topic—or at least a topic that doesn't make him quiet and confused.
Jacob: You'll like this one, you was in it, he tells her.
Queenie: Hot socks! she exclaims, giggling and wiggling a bit on spot.
Jacob: I dreamt we was at Macy's, he says, and we were... I don't know how I knew this, but you know how in dreams sometimes you just know things.
Queenie: Yeah, of course.
Jacob: So, we were looking for something we couldn't see and somehow I knew we had to be real sneaky-like. One of my flying snake monsters was up in the ceiling and we had to be careful not to spook it.
Queenie: Did we catch it? she asks.
Jacob: Yeah, in a teapot.
Queenie: A teapot! she repeats, thrilled by the detail of his memory.
Jacob: I found a bug, see, he goes on, turning to face her, cheeks pinked slightly with excitement and maybe a touch of embarrassment. There's a part of him that thinks his dreams are silly and that Queenie will spurn him for foolishness if he tells her too much. Queenie does her level best to encourage him in the hopes that the more he talks about his dreams, the more the memories will return to him. Queenie is ever hopeful that one day Jacob will look at her and she will see in his mind that he knows. He continues, And I threw it and you... I mean, it must'a been you. You caught the bug in a teapot and the flying snake chased it in. Bing bang boom. We caught the monster.
Queenie: Alright, I gotta question for you, Mr. Kowalski, says Queenie, turning now to face him. There's perhaps a foot of space between them and she's close enough to see the striation in his dark brown eyes."
2,11294718,Queenie,Jacob,"Queenie: and you… I mean, it must’a been you. You caught the bug in a teapot and the flying snake chased it in. Bing bang boom. We caught the monster.
Jacob: *opens his mouth and inhales to answer, but then stops. Stumped. He scratches his head and then jerks his hand back; his fingers are covered in flour and he’s just smeared it in his hair.*
Queenie: You’ve got some wild imagination, sweetie. *laughs and dabs more flour onto his nose.*
Jacob: Nah, baloney. Thanks for helping out again, Queenie. You’re the cat’s pajamas, you really are.
Queenie: It’s my pleasure. It’s nice to have a place to go sometimes that isn’t home and to have such sweet company.
Jacob: Aw, Queenie, you know you can come here any time you like.
Queenie: Thanks, honey.

Queenie: Hi, Teen. Is the Director in yet?
Tina: Yeah, he just got in a few minutes ago.
Franklin: Do you know why he was late?
Queenie: *glances at Tina and Tina raises her eyebrows in response.*
Tina: He also likes to keep his professional life and personal life separate. So, if we don’t know why he was late today, then it’s because it was for something personal.
Franklin: You’re a damn loyal friend, Goldstein.
Tina: I do my best."
3,11294718,Goldstein,Graves,"Franklin: You're a damn loyal friend, Goldstein.
Tina: I do my best.
Queenie: You got a bit of jelly on your lip.
Tina: *makes a squeaking sound in her throat and grabs a napkin*
Queenie: *grins toothily, spins on her heel, and flounces off to Percival's office*
Queenie: I know you got your own coffee, but I thought I'd bring you something sweet.
Percival: Thank you, Miss Goldstein.
Queenie: 'Fraid not. I think the house elves in the cafeteria would be heartbroken if we ordered pastries from an outside establishment.
Percival: Well, we mustn't upset the house elves.
Queenie: *asks while busying herself with preparing a perfect cup of coffee for Percival* So, how long 'til Newt comes back?
Percival: He was unable to give me a proper estimate. Merlin knows how long he'll be in Norway chasing hydras—
Queenie: Huldra.
Percival: Right. For all I know, he could spend a year in Norway living with a single species of magical beast and be quite content.
Queenie: You know he wouldn't now that he's got you.
Percival: I don't know about 'non-stop.'
Queenie: Well, whatever. You know what I mean!
Percival: I do. Thank you.
Queenie: Sure thing, honey. Have a nice day, Mr. Graves.
Percival: You, as well, Miss Goldstein.
Queenie: *shoots him a wink before she picks up her tray and strides out the door*"
4,11294718,Jacob,Queenie,"Jacob: Hi, Queenie. How's you doin' today?
Queenie: Everything's Jake.
Jacob: Ooh, har-har. I ain't ever heard that one before.
Queenie: Really, Queen.
Jacob: You're sweet.
Queenie: Thanks, honey.
Jacob: You're something sweet.
Queenie: It was just a long day, is all. I went outside my usual routine to bring Tina's boss a pastry. He's missing his sweetheart, see, so I thought he might like a little something sweet.
Jacob: You're something sweet.
Queenie: You're sweet.
Tina: *no engagement*
Queenie: *no engagement*"
5,11294718,Jacob,Tina,"Jacob: You must be Tina. Pleased to finally meet you, I'm Jacob. Queenie talks all about you.
Tina: Good things, I hope.
Jacob: Eh, sisterly things.
Tina: *laughs*

Jacob: So how do you make the erumpent loaves?
Queenie: That's the name I made up for your funny creature loaves. The ones that look kinda like a rhinoceros?
Jacob: Erumpent. Huh... I like that. It fits.
Queenie: Doesn't it?
Tina: Queenie's on a mission to come up with names for all your pastries. She's been bouncing all sorts of funny words off me all week.
Jacob: Oh, yeah? What else ya got for me?
Queenie: Well, we was thinking occamy would be nice for the Danishes.
Jacob: *pauses, brows pulling in confusion* Occamy... That sounds... I feel like I've heard that before?
Queenie: Maybe you've heard me say it."
6,11294718,Queenie,Jacob,"Queenie: That sounds... I feel like I've heard that before?
Jacob: *nods vaguely in agreement*
Queenie: Maybe you've heard me say it.
Queenie: *sees the turmoil inside Jacob* The fear that he has forgotten something vitally important.
Queenie: *worries about Jacob's fear and his memories being restored*
Tina: So, show me how to make a creature loaf.
Tina: *has flour dusted down her front and dough stuck under her fingernails and her eyes are shining*
Jacob: *throws himself wholeheartedly into his work, regaining his brightness as he goes*
Queenie: *knows it is only a matter of time before the wizarding world notices Kowalski's Quality Baked Goods*
Queenie: *can't think of a single thing she can do to stop the inevitable from happening*
Queenie: *waits and watches and anticipates*
Queenie: *opens her mind to the hum of thoughts around her, searching for a warning about Kowalski's being discovered*
Queenie: *doesn't know what she can do if Kowalski's is discovered*
Queenie: *waits for a warning, hoping some warning is better than no warning*
Queenie: *is surprised by the abrupt arrival of Director Percival Graves at Kowalski's Quality Baked Goods*
Queenie: *nearly drops the tray of fresh cookies she has just brought out*
Queenie: Oh, my. Oh, dear.
Queenie: *sets the tray aside and hurries around the counter*
Queenie: *feels wrong-footed and worried*
Queenie: *beams a little too widely* Funny seeing you here.
Percival: *narrows his eyes slightly at Queenie*
Queenie: *touches Percival's arm to regain his attention*
Queenie: So, uh, what brings you all the way out here during work hours?"
7,11294718,Percival,Queenie,"Percival: Funny seeing you here.
Queenie: Quite.
Percival: *eyes narrowing ever so slightly at her before shifting to take in the distinctly non-magical atmosphere of the establishment.*
Queenie: *flutters out to touch his arm and regain his attention* So, uh, what brings you all the way out here during work hours?
Percival: I received a top priority memo about a peculiar bakery. *nodding pointedly towards a three-tiered display of erumpent loaves* The last thing I expected was to find you, Miss Goldstein, already at the scene.
Queenie: *flinches at his use of formal title* Mr. Graves, I know this looks bad, but it’s Jacob and he—
Percival: Queenie, *he says heavily* Come to my office tomorrow morning. We’ll talk then.
Queenie: *stands rooted to the spot, arms crossed over her stomach, hands clutching her elbows, and squeezing tight as if to hold herself together.*
Jacob: *comes up beside her, scratching at the faint scar on his neck and staring after Percival with furrowed brows* Who was that, Queens?
Queenie: *glances at Jacob from the corner of her eye* That was Teenie’s boss, *she answers quietly* He’s our friend, too, but I think… I messed up and I think I made him real angry with me.
Jacob: No way, *Jacob says immediately* Who could ever be mad at you.
Jacob: You need cocoa.
Jacob: *sits her down in the back, guiding her into a cushioned chair at a little table in the corner with soft hands and a sweet smile.*
Jacob: *continues to send her little comforting glances throughout the long, non-magical process of heating milk and adding the chocolate, but quickly enough he is setting a steaming mug before her.*
Queenie: Thanks, honey.
Jacob: Now, then, *says Jacob, sitting across from her* Why would Tina’s boss be mad at you?
Queenie: *wraps her hands around the mug and bites her lip* It’s still office hours where we work and I’m not meant to be here.
Jacob: You said you was workin’ a half-shift today, *says Jacob, with a confused frown.*
Queenie: *lips twitch upward* I did. I am. Mr. Graves is a real stickler and he..."
8,11294718,Jacob,Queenie,"Jacob: You said you was workin' a half-shift today.
Queenie: I did. I am. Mr. Graves is a real stickler and he's been running himself ragged lately... Maybe he just forgot.
Jacob: There, that's an easy fix. You just gotta talk to him tomorrow and I'll bet he's gonna be real embarrassed when you explain things to him. In the meantime, drink your cocoa and hows about I teach you how to make kremówka when you're finished? It was my grandma's specialty.
Queenie: Thanks, honey. I'd like that.

Percival: Miss Goldstein. According to the reports, Mr. Kowalski was Obliviated nearly a year ago. Is that correct?
Queenie: *shakes her head, clears her throat* I really couldn't say, Mr. Graves. He was makin' those pastries and loaves before I...
Percival: You sought him out.
Queenie: Please, Mr. Graves. I love him, I love him so much, I... Teenie says he looks at me the same way you look at Newt.

Percival: Miss Goldstein. Queenie. You must understand that I am sympathetic to your plight, I truly am, but I cannot help you. If you want to fight this law— If you want to legitimize your relationship in the eyes of the government, then I cannot help you."
9,11294718,Percival,Queenie,"Percival: Queenie. You must understand that I am sympathetic to your plight, I truly am, but I cannot help you. *leans forward over his desk*
Queenie: *sniffles and scoots closer* If you want to fight this law— If you want to legitimize your relationship in the eyes of the government, then I cannot help you.
Percival: Tina will help you. It doesn’t even need saying. Or go to Abasi, he’s a decent man, very reasonable and open-minded. I’m certain he will help you as well.
Queenie: *nods and wipes the stray tears from her cheeks* Okay.
Percival: I will do everything in my power to keep you here and safe, should it come to that. But I’m sorry to say I cannot do the same for Jacob.
Queenie: *whispers* I understand.
Percival: And, of course, you don’t have to do anything at all if you don’t wish to. I haven’t filed a follow-up report on Kowalski’s yet, but for you, just this once, I’m willing to bend the rules. I saw no cause for alarm, just pastries shaped like animals.
Queenie: Thank you, but I think I should, do something that is, seein’ as I’m in a position that’ll make my voice heard.
Percival: *stands* You’re a strong woman. You’ll be just fine.
Queenie: *pulls back from the hug* Thanks, Mr. Graves.
Percival: Off you go, then, Miss Goldstein.
Queenie: *giggles, flickers a wink at Percival, and reaches out to tickle Daphne under the chin before making her exit.*

Queenie: So, Tina, say you wanted to change a law… How would you go about doin’ it?
Tina: *eyes Queenie with only the slightest bit of suspicion* Depends on if you want to change a state law or a national law.
Queenie: Oh. Yikes. State law."
10,11294718,Queenie,Tina,"Queenie: Depends on if you want to change a state law or a national law.
Tina: So, it’s a state law, that means you want to meet with a house representative or local councilor, someone in Picquery’s Cabinet. Percival would be your best option.
Queenie: I talked to him this morning. He says he can’t help me.
Tina: Oh… Did he say why?
Queenie: Not in words, no, but I understand why he can’t.
Tina: Then we’ll get Abasi to help. He’s a decent man, he’ll help.
Queenie: Percival said the same thing.
Tina: You should also write to Newt. His brother’s an Auror, he can tell you all about Britain’s laws for relationships with no-majs.
Queenie: That’s a great idea. Thanks, Teenie.
Tina: He’s worth it, right?
Queenie: He is. And even if it don’t work out for me, I gotta try for everyone who comes after.
Queenie: I’ve got a moment after I finish up here, if that’s okay?
Queenie: *breaks into a wide grin*
Red: *grumbles a greeting at her and jabs the button with his walking stick.*
Queenie: *steps into the department floor*
Franklin: *is particularly distressed and therefore an open book to Queenie*"
11,11294718,Graves,Daphne,"Queenie: He got hit by a no-maj car?
Tina: About an hour ago, near a no-maj corner of town. He was taken to a no-maj hospital before we even heard about what happened and then someone had to go get him...
Queenie: Where is he now? Is he okay? Is Daphne okay?
Tina: Director Graves is going to be fine.
Sadie Strenburg: Graves was walking past a known, no-maj-heavy area and no, I don’t know why. It wasn’t at the top of my priority list to ask. He was on foot when he was suddenly struck from behind by a vehicle, doing heavy damage to his pelvic bones and lower spine. According to witnesses, the vehicle swerved off the road to strike him, leading no-maj police to believe the hit was intentional.
Franklin: *gasps loudly*
Strenburg: The no-maj healers were contacted and brought him to their hospital. Director Graves told me he does not remember much of what happened between being hit and coming to in a hospital room. He struck his head during the incident and then the no-maj healers gave him a… Er, a shoot? A shoot of their medicine to make him numb. I transfigured my ID badge to pass as Graves’s sister and, well."
12,11294718,Percy,Graves,"Strenburg: The healers had a hell of a time trying to get ole Percy to cooperate. I don’t think they believed he’s deaf ‘cause he kept talkin’ at ‘em, trying to get them to look at him head-on. Poor saps, they was so confused. Anyway, before I left St. Agatha’s, Graves wanted me to tell you why he was there in that corner of the city. Said it’s important that you two know because he knows how the rumor mill works around here. He’s been learning sign language and the best teacher from our world is a squib who happens to live right on the edge of a no-maj neighborhood.
Queenie: Aw, wow. That’s just grand, good for him!
Tina: *nods in agreement* Did you find anything about the driver?
Strenburg: Not much. I talked to the no-maj bulls, played my concerned-and-demanding sister role, but they couldn’t tell me a whole lot. No trace of the driver, they said, almost like he vanished from the scene.
Tina: *blows out a gusty sigh* So, some witch or wizard used a no-maj car to attack Percival?
Strenburg: Seems like it, but after that hallway business are we really so surprised?
Tina: *says darkly* I suppose not."
13,11294718,Tina,Strenburg,"Tina: Well, we won't find out anything new by sitting here talking about it.
Strenburg: *rises from Tina's chair and heads off to her own desk*
Tina: *shifts down into her chair and scrubs her hands over her face* Weren't you on your way to see Abasi?
Queenie: Right, yeah, *musters up a smile before heading off*
Abasi: I was told that you're interested in changing a state law.
Queenie: Yeah, but with the Director injured, is now the right time?
Abasi: It's as good a time as any. If you wait for the right time, you'll never find it. There will always be something around here.
Queenie: *nods quietly* Miss Goldstein, I won't sugarcoat this for you. This is a monumental task to take on. Given the current state of affairs in the wizarding community, it will be immensely difficult to get anyone to listen to your plea. Many will write you off as a woman with a crush, some may even accuse you of being sympathetic to Grindelwald, and you won't be able to go to the Director for help.
Queenie: I know.
Abasi: Your best bet, I'm afraid, is to get the President on your side and she will likely be the most difficult to convince. You'll want to take time to decide your points, polish them, prepare for all possible arguments and counterpoints. You will have to face the entire Board of Directors as well, which I imagine will not be pleasant for you without Mr. Graves there.
Queenie: *alarmed*
Abasi: I'm not trying to frighten you, Miss Goldstein. I just want you to know exactly what you are getting into. If you are willing, I would be happy to do everything in my power to prepare you for that and future meetings.
Queenie: I'd sure appreciate that, Mr. Abasi.
Abasi: *smiles widely* President Emily Rappaport wanted to leave nothing to chance or uncertainty when she wrote this law. Take your time reading this, underline passages, take notes, dog-ear the pages. Whatever you need to do to learn the law backwards and forwards. I also recommend reading The Intricacies of Rappaport's..."
14,11294718,President Emily Rappaport,Tina,"Abasi: President Emily Rappaport wanted to leave nothing to chance or uncertainty when she wrote this law. Take your time reading this, underline passages, take notes, dog-ear the pages. Whatever you need to do to learn the law backwards and forwards. I also recommend reading The Intricacies of Rappaport’s Law, I believe your sister has a copy?
Queenie: She does.
Abasi: The first step is to read those books. Please don’t hesitate to come to me with questions or for clarification.
Queenie: I won’t. Thank you.
Queenie: Hi, honey. Come sit, have some cocoa.
Newt: Thank you, Queenie.
Newt: Rappaport’s Law. Tina mentioned you were researching muggle laws. I sent an owl to my brother, told him to forward you a detailed copy of our muggle laws for you to study.
Queenie: Thanks, hon. That was real sweet of you.
Tina: Percival’s going to be just fine. Strenburg was there when he got picked up by the no-maj healers and she made sure he got to St. Agatha’s in one piece.
Newt: I know… And thank you for sending for me so quickly.
Tina: Well, of course. You get some rest now. Go on and take my bed, I’ll bunk in here. Tomorrow I’ll bring you straight to St. Agatha’s to see Percival.
Newt: Yes, thank you."
15,11294718,Tina,Newt,"Tina: You get some rest now. Go on and take my bed, I’ll bunk in here. Tomorrow I’ll bring you straight to St. Agatha’s to see Percival.
Newt: Yes, thank you.
Queenie: I got it, sweetie.
Newt: Ah, right. Much appreciated.
Queenie: I’ll give you a few minutes to change and settle in.
Queenie: *leaves him to it and returns to the living room where she helps Tina transfigure the sofa and cushions into a cot and blankets.*
Queenie: *returns to the bedroom*
Newt: I know Percival is perfectly capable of taking care of himself. He didn’t get to where he is by chance, after all, but I still… I still worry.
Newt: This, today, getting run down by a muggle vehicle… We never could have imagined something like this.
Queenie: Shh, it’s okay, honey, it’s okay. He’s fine now and you’ll see him tomorrow. Perry’s okay and Daphne’s okay. Shh, sweetie, it’s okay.
Newt: Percival would be appalled if he ever heard you use that nickname.
Queenie: Then it’ll be our little secret.
Newt: That’s a lovely offer, but please don’t trouble yourself. I’ll be perfectly alright.
Queenie: If you’re sure…"
16,11294718,Newt,Queenie,"Newt: That’s a lovely offer, but please don’t trouble yourself. I’ll be perfectly alright.
Queenie: If you’re sure…
Newt: I’m sure.
Queenie: Well, how about I read you one of Teenie’s boring books to help you fall asleep. The sooner you fall asleep, the sooner you’ll wake up in the morning and see Perry.
Newt: Alright. Let’s hear it.
Queenie: In 1790, the fifteenth President of MACUSA, Emily Rappaport, instituted a law to create total segregation between the wizarding and No-Maj communities...
Queenie: She has just come across a name she did not expect to recognize. Barebone.
Tina: Will you be alright here on your own?
Newt: I appreciate your concern, but I’ll be just fine here. In all honesty, I’d make miserable company if I were anywhere else.
Tina: But if you change your mind...
Newt: I’ll come find you at MACUSA.
Queenie: *stays with Newt and conjures a pair of cozy chairs*
Newt: You’ve been fiddling with your purse all morning.
Queenie: *extracts The Intricacies of Rappaport’s Law from her beaded clutch*"
17,11294718,Credence,Tina,"Credence: Actually...
Tina: You gotta emphasize the benefits.
Strenburg: You don't want to start a war or nothing, you just want to be able to talk to the cute no-maj across the street without getting arrested.
Queenie: I'm basing a lot of my arguments off the letter I received from Theseus Scamander.
Queenie: British law obviously still complies with the Statute of Secrecy, but without banning interaction between wizards and no-majs.
Queenie: It really just means that Britain has a higher number of half-bloods and that students are allowed to bring their wands home during vacations.
Abasi: What are the stipulations for revealing the existence of magic to a non-magical person?
Queenie: Marriage.
Abasi: And should the relationship between parents turn sour?"
18,11294718,Queenie,Abasi,"Queenie: Because someone is going to ask. Of course, every witch or wizard who decides to start a relationship with a no-maj must understand that the decision is theirs alone and that they claim full responsibility for the consequences, whatever they may be. That said, should a relationship be terminated, it is the responsibility of the magical half to report the divorce to the appropriate department within MACUSA so that the non-magical half can be properly Obliviated.
Abasi: And what constitutes a proper Obliviation? Certainly, we cannot wipe what could likely be years of memories from a no-maj’s mind. Not to mention the amount of non-magical in-laws that also have memories involving the magical parent, even if they do not have any knowledge of magic itself.
Queenie: The divorced no-maj would not have his or her memories completely erased. It would be a selective Obliviation, which would entail blurring out memories and conversations concerning the existence of magic.
Abasi: And the children?
Queenie: *interrupted by a flurry of mental voices*
Queenie: Tina just got a big lead. I don’t think the Board of Directors is going to care what I have to say until this pans out.
Strenburg: Well, hey, you wasn’t working on a particular timeline, right? You won’t be letting anyone down if you have to wait a while longer to bring this to the Board."
19,11294718,Strenburg,Queenie,"Strenburg: Well, hey, *clasping Queenie's shoulder comfortingly*, you wasn't working on a particular timeline, right? You won't be letting anyone down if you have to wait a while longer to bring this to the Board.
Abasi: That's right, *encourages*, All this means is that you have more time to make your points airtight.
Queenie: *slumped in her seat*
Queenie: He don't remember all that much, *says quietly as they approach the shop*, and what he does, he writes off as funny dreams. But it's all in there, I know it is.
Newt: I'm sure it is, *agrees readily, honestly*, I know I don't need to tell you just how remarkable the mind is.
Queenie: *beams at him* and then presses open the door and glides inside, announced by the high tinkle of the bell.
Newt: Oh, these are wonderful, *says with feeling*, Simply fantastic. Look at the detail here.
Jacob: Aw, jeez, thanks, mister."
20,11294718,Jacob,Queenie,"Jacob: That is so clever!
Queenie: Aw, jeez, thanks, mister.
Jacob: Hi, honey.
Queenie: Haven't seen you in a while.
Jacob: I know, sugar. But I'm all freed up now, I promise.
Jacob: Now. You gonna introduce me to your friend?
Queenie: Hello.
Newt: Hey, mister, you dropped your... Egg?
Jacob: Jacob. S'real nice to meet you.
Newt: Really, it is a pleasure to meet the man behind all the delightful pastries Queenie is always bringing around.
Jacob: We've just escaped from Teenie and Mr. Graves. They brought work home and haven't been any fun at all this morning.
Jacob: You've come to just the right place.
Jacob: I was just about to make some pączki. You two interested in learning how?
Queenie: Yes, please!
Newt: Very much!
Queenie: This, Queenie thinks, more than anything, is what she wants: laughter and friendship and love. This, she realizes, is what she wants for everyone around her and everyone who may one day find themselves in her shoes. This, she vows, is what she is going to fight for and keep fighting for, for as long as it takes to make a change."
