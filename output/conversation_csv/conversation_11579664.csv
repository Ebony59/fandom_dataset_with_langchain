0,11579664,Peter,Tony,"Peter: I was in the neighborhood!
Tony: Likely story.
Peter: *swung by close enough to yell*
Tony: *patching through Peter's suit to talk to him directly instead of yelling*"

Tony: Likely story.
Peter: *swinging by close enough to yell*
Tony: *patching through Peter's suit to talk to him directly*
Peter: *using rapid-fire to shoot webs at some of the aliens' blasters*
Peter: *trying his best to minimize collateral damage*
Peter: *catching a bus full of people before it could crash into a building*
Thor: *doing some sort of space-magic*
Tony: *pushing Peter towards the jet*
Peter: *sitting on a plane with the Earth's Mightiest Heroes*
Peter: Wow guys did you know that my tenth birthday party was Avengers-themed.
Captain America: Are you alright?
Peter: *pointing at the hole burned into Cap's uniform*
Captain America: Just a minor burn. Already healed up.
Peter: That's really awesome.
Peter: *noticing Cap sliding his shield away from him*
Peter: I'm not gonna steal it again. That was one time!
Tony: *snickering at Peter*
Captain America: *looking slightly abashed*
Captain America: *not putting his shield back within Peter's reach*
Dr. Banner: *gesturing towards the spider on Peter's chest*
Dr. Banner: You were bit. By a radioactive spider?
Peter: Yeah? I mean. I'm admittedly using radioactive a little loosey-goosey, because I don't really know exactly what modifications and experiments it was exposed to, but it definitely gave me superpowers. It's pretty cool to be able to crawl on ceilings though.
Hawkeye: So the web-stuff, that's not coming out of you, right? Cuz that's been bothering me.
Peter: Eww, no. I invented that? I'm pretty happy with it so far but I've been tweaking it to have better tensile strength, but chem class is only an hour so I don't have a lot of time for experimentation.
Peter: *realizing he said too much and slinking down in his seat*"
2,11579664,Hawkeye,Falcon,"Hawkeye: You’re one of those super-nerds, too?
Falcon: Wait, are you seriously in high school? Can you even drive?
Tony: Underoos has elected to keep his identity secret. Though I will confirm that he is in fact a nerd. I suppose super-nerd is technically correct since he also has superpowers.
Black Widow: Totally a high schooler. Is child endangerment something we should be worrying about?
Peter: Um, I have to take this.
Aunt May: So you’re still alive. Good. That makes it easier for me to murder you when you get home. I thought we were in agreement?
Peter: Yeah, but… I couldn’t not help. And I’m totally okay, I promise.
Aunt May: Good. Put Stark on the phone, please.
Peter: Um, no?
Aunt May: It wasn’t a question.
Peter: It’s for you.
Tony: Nuh-uh. I’m busy.
Tony: Uh-huh. What, do you want me to help him with his homework, too? Why do you have a B in calculus? That’s unacceptable. You know calculus.
Peter: Um, yeah, but I missed a few quizzes and there might have been some homework I skipped.
Tony: Are you skipping homework right now? You’re not even an Avenger, remember? No fighting aliens when there’s homework.
Peter: I’m not skipping homework right now."
3,11579664,Tony,Peter,"Tony: It's homework, Tony said, and Peter was pretty sure he was being dead serious.
Peter: I'm not skipping homework right now, Peter said, which was mostly even true, since he'd started toting his backpack along with him on patrol.

Peter: Hey, wasn't it weird that aliens showed up? Peter said loudly, his voice only slightly cracking. Like, did anyone else get a weird vibe off that whole thing? Aliens attacking isn't normally a thing.
Black Widow: *smirking at her phone*
Falcon: *gave him a disapproving look but couldn't hold it for longer than a few seconds*

Dr. Banner: It was somewhat atypical, Dr. Banner offered.
Peter: *beamed at him*

Captain America: You shouldn't be skipping on school to do this stuff, Captain America said, completely negating Dr. Banner's noble efforts in supporting Peter's change of subject.
Peter: Ugh, dude, please don't launch into the one about following rules, I've got the speech memorized already.

Tony: I didn't realize you'd met, Tony said, and Peter was pretty sure that he sounded jealous which was totally freaking awesome and Ned was going to die when he heard that Tony Stark thought he had exclusive lecture-rights for Peter.
Captain America: *shook his head slightly, as if he -- Captain America! -- were begging Peter Parker, high school sophomore, to not rat him out.*

Peter: Dude. Dude. You guys haven't seen the PSAs?
Captain America: *put his head in his hands*

Black Widow: How did you know about this? Black Widow said, delighted, which was terrifying and beautiful at the same time.
Peter: They're like, required viewing? Peter offered. They show them all the time at school? I've seen the detention one so many times, seriously. So you've got detention...

Tony: *gave him a slightly disapproving look*
Peter: *shrugged at him*

Captain America: They said it was an important morale booster, Captain America muttered.
Peter: *patted him on the shoulder*"
4,11579664,Captain America,Peter,"Captain America: They said it was an important morale booster. This is the USO tour all over again.
Peter: *patted him on the shoulder* You’re very inspiring in them.
Captain America: *gave him a look*

Tony: You’re coming to my lab as soon as you’ve eaten something. I mean, a B student, my god. You’re an embarrassment to child prodigies everywhere. Bruce will come, too. It’ll be a party. A science party.
Dr. Banner: *grinned at Peter* Bruce is too tired from Hulking out to science right now.
Hawkeye: *asked Black Widow behind them* One little superhero-family feud and everything gets super weird when we reunite.
Black Widow: As long as no one in the media finds out he’s an actual child, I say we keep him on the basis of that puberty PSA alone. Steve is a sneakier bastard than I realized, keeping something that important from us.
Falcon: *asked* How many more are there, do you think? I mean, I just think I need to know what to do with these emotions I’m feeling from my changing body.
Ant-Man: *added* So many urges, so little understanding. Surely Captain America can tell us what to do.
Captain America: *casually* Yeah, fuck off.
Peter: *starts to cackle gleefully*
Tony: *pats him proudly on the shoulder* Okay, kid, you’ve officially earned your keep.
Peter: Still not an Avenger.
Tony: JV squad, then. Or waterboy! You any good at pouring drinks?
Pepper: *interrupted* Absolutely not. I’ve arranged a ride back for you in the morning. You okay staying here tonight?
Peter: Yeah, totally.
Tony: *grinning at Pepper* Or waterboy! You any good at pouring drinks?
Pepper: *interrupted* Absolutely not. I’ve arranged a ride back for you in the morning. You okay staying here tonight?
Peter: Yeah, totally.
Captain America: *said audibly* It’s not like you lot are perfect, you know."
