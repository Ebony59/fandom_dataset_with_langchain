0,116314,John,Sherlock,"John: You went to Tesco?
Sherlock: I needed raspberry cordial. I want to see how the dilution of the cordial affects staining, and it's always good for splatter pattern analysis. You needed bread.
John: We weren't even out.
Sherlock: *passes the bread without a word*
John: Pass the milk?
Sherlock: *passes the milk without a word*
John: *closes the fridge door and turns around to find Sherlock right behind him*"
1,116314,John,Sherlock,"John: It's funny what goes through your head. *thinks to himself*
John: The last time he kissed someone taller than him was Jenny Hargreaves in fifth form. *recalls a memory*
John: She had legs all the way down to the floor, and wore skirts that never touched her knees, and for five glorious weeks he'd had a crick in his neck from snogging her. *describes Jenny Hargreaves*
John: Since then, he's dated shorter girls with longer skirts, and he's used to leaning down to kiss. *explains his dating history*
John: But for once, he isn't leaning up or down. Sherlock's ducked his head down the differential few inches to press his lips against John's. *describes the kiss with Sherlock*
John: And Sherlock's lips are warm and slightly parted, warm like the press of Sherlock's nose and the soft exhale against John's cheek. *describes the sensation of the kiss*
John: Nothing like the cold hand Sherlock presses against his shirt, under John's open jacket. *mentions Sherlock's cold hand*
John: John keeps his eyes open, as does Sherlock, and mostly he wonders what Sherlock could possibly be up to. *wonders about Sherlock's intentions*
John: There'll be some logic to this. Some ridiculous experiment about body warmth or respiratory rates or testing a new way of picking pockets. *speculates Sherlock's motives*
John: Sherlock does the unimaginable for bizarre reasons, but behind it, there's always logic and curiosity. *reflects on Sherlock's behavior*
John: Sometimes, it just takes him a while to explain it to John. *acknowledges Sherlock's tendency to explain later*
Sherlock: *pulls back and watches John carefully, then gives one sharp nod*
Sherlock: Turning, he collects the dark red cordial and walks out, presumably to his room. *leaves the room*
John: *checks his wallet and sandwiches, then sits on the sofa and turns on the TV*

John: *half asleep, wakes up from nightmares and goes downstairs*
Sherlock: Want a cup of tea? *asks John*
John: Here, *Sherlock hands John a teacup*
John: You? Tea? *questions Sherlock's ability to make tea*
Sherlock: Mrs Hudson made it. *explains who made the tea*
Sherlock: *kisses John on the lips* Morning. *leaves John alone with the tea*
John: *realizes something is wrong and goes to Sherlock's room*
John: Mrs Hudson made us tea? *asks Sherlock*
Sherlock: I promised we'd dust the shelves. *explains his promise to Mrs Hudson*
John: I did that days ago. *reminds Sherlock that he already did the task*
Sherlock: I know. But Mrs Hudson hadn't realized that. For some reason, the better reward is always offered for the promise of labor rather than confirmation that the labor was done. *explains Mrs Hudson's reward system*
John: But you used my labor to gain a reward for yourself. *accuses Sherlock*
Sherlock: Really, I used the promise of your labor. And I shared. *clarifies his actions*
John: Out of a pot of tea, I got one cup? *questions the fairness of the tea distribution*
Sherlock: I shared a portion commensurate with your input into negotiations. *justifies his portion of the tea*
John: *skulks off to have a shower, muttering about the hot water*

John: *after eating butter chicken*
Sherlock: *trying to identify a pattern in Indian restaurants*
Sherlock: Sherlock believes that the varying level of spice used in each restaurant will reflect the general heat of all dishes prepared. *explains his theory*"
2,116314,John,Sherlock,"John: I shared a portion commensurate with your input into negotiations. *John skulks off to have a shower, and muttering under his breath about using a 'commensurate portion' of the hot water.*
Sherlock: A vindaloo three times as spicy as you expected would not be a pleasant experience, or one you'd wish to repeat. *Sherlock rolls his eyes, replying to John's question about the butter chicken.*
John: How are you paying for this?
Sherlock: On credit, *Sherlock says, brandishing a bright orange card in Donovan's name. Last night was on Anderson. And Lestrade paid for the night before.*
John: They're police. I don't think they take kindly to stealing.
Sherlock: I exchange it for a false card and return the true card in the morning. By the time they see the charge on their monthly statement, there's nothing they can do.
John: It's going to take Lestrade thirty seconds to realise it's you.
Sherlock: Oh, they'll know I did it, but they won't know how. And they won't be able to prove it was me.
John: I take it you've made sure our flat's clean?
Sherlock: Of course, *Sherlock says, slowing as they walk past the eatery downstairs from them. He stops outside their door and says, I'm going to keep walking. They've been working on Weymouth Street and I need to know the impact on pedestrian traffic.*
John: I'm thinking an early night, so I'll see you tomorrow.
Sherlock: Okay, *Sherlock says, then he leans forward and kisses John. One hand on John's shoulder and standing at John's doorstep, and there's no way that this isn't a goodnight kiss. They're on a public street and there's space between them, but Sherlock's eyes are closed and his mouth is warm and wet. Sherlock's tongue is against his lips, not pushing, not demanding, but there, alive and inviting and the clear possibility of sex. It's the kind of kiss for the end of a particularly good date.*
Sherlock: Good night. *There's the hint of a smile, not as smug as before but still secretive and pleased, and then Sherlock walks off.*"
3,116314,John,Sherlock,"John: And that, John thinks as he slowly, purposely trudges up each stair to his room, is the most annoying part of all. Sherlock changed the rules without telling him. Dates are supposed to be fun and lively, there's supposed to be flirting and making yourself sound better than you really are. John's good at dating. He doesn't usually spend dates sitting quietly at a table, playing Tetris on his mobile phone while Sherlock tries to spot a secret spice-o-meter. It's not the way things are supposed to be done, John finds himself thinking as he gets ready for bed. It's a stupid thought. Sherlock never does anything the way it's supposed to be done.
John: The next morning, John wonders. He's half-tempted to blurt out the question, to simply ask Sherlock if last night was a date or something… more mundane? More typical of Sherlock? Less romantic? He doesn't know how he'd phrase the question, let alone how to ask it.
John: Last night could be a date. It has all the traditional signs of one. If it anyone other than Sherlock -- or Mycroft, John mentally amends -- he'd make the assumption easily. But this isn't, so…
John: John pulls out a piece of paper and finds a pen cowering amongst the assorted piles on their kitchen table. He clears enough space to sit down and write, and starts making a possible list of motives.
John: There are a lot of thoughts that end with question marks. Too many for John to make an educated guess and none seem suitably surreal for a Sherlock-inspired experiment. But knowing Sherlock, any and all are possible. Sherlock likes to set up expectations and then defy them, so at the end, John adds: 6. Actual date caused by honest romantic interest. It looks so ridiculous he..."
4,116314,John,Mycroft,"John: There are a lot of thoughts that end with question marks. Too many for John to make an educated guess and none seem suitably surreal for a Sherlock-inspired experiment. But knowing Sherlock, any and all are possible.
John: It looks so ridiculous he considers scribbling through it. Or leave the page lying around for Sherlock to pick the correct answer.
John: What John wants is to come up with a seventh option. Something that makes sense.
John: Failing that, he'd like a second opinion, which is harder than it sounds when it comes to Sherlock.
John: The only other person who knows Sherlock beyond the swirling coat and staggering intellect is…Mycroft.
John: John has Mycroft's number.
John: But it can't hurt to rule out a possibility on his list, right? He's pretty sure he's done stupider things in the name of being Sherlock's flatmate, friend and murder-solving colleague. He's stared down explosives and sharpshooters and been attacked by a trained, international assassin. This is almost the same.
John: John pulls up the contacts on his mobile, closes his eyes for one deep breath and dials. It's answered on the first ring tone.
Mycroft: Ah, John, Mycroft says in a voice like chilled cream (smooth and very, very cold). While it is always a pleasure, for the sake of expediency let me confirm that I have not spoken to Sherlock, nor offered him either advice or employment, since I last visited the two of you at 221B.
Mycroft: I know Sherlock. I do not need to know the specific circumstances to know that you would only call me -- halfway through your lunch hour at the clinic, I believe -- to confirm Sherlock's latest round of theatrics were not a direct response to contact with me.
John: John nods. He's on the phone, but he nods. Mycroft continues, My apologies for being impolite but I'm in the midst of a pressing matter. Do give my best to Sherlock, and then hangs up."
5,116314,John,Sherlock,"John: Dr Nguyen finally succumbed to the stomach flu.
Sherlock: You were supposed to be home three hours ago.
John: *doesn't say anything*
Sherlock: This could have a better result than even I expected.
John: Yeah, about that--
Sherlock: No, this will be great."
6,116314,John,Sherlock,"John: Yeah, about that--
Sherlock: No, this will be great.
John: What the buggery fuck, Sherlock?
Sherlock: That's the gist of it.
John: That is the fourth, well, fifth time you've kissed me. Why?
Sherlock: It's a preliminary to sex.
John: But why?
Sherlock: I'm not sure. I suspect it's the skin-on-skin intimacy while being fully clothed that makes it a logical step to sexual intercourse.
John: Not why does kissing lead to sex. Why did you want to sleep with me?
Sherlock: I hadn't factored on sleeping being involved. I only fell asleep because you were late.
John: Either tell me why you're trying to sleep with me, specifically, or get out of my bed.
Sherlock: You're being purposely obtuse.
John: You look like a Cirque du Soleil performer enjoying a lie-down.
Sherlock: *doesn't look away from the textbook*
John: I'm making toast. You want any?"
7,116314,John,Sherlock,"John: You look like a Cirque du Soleil performer enjoying a lie-down.
Sherlock: *doesn't look away from the three-inch thick textbook*
John: Right.
John: I'm making toast. You want any? *pauses a moment before heading into the kitchen*
Sherlock: *sulks like Manchester United fans watch a match*
John: He butters two extra pieces and gets a second plate. Sherlock eyes him as he puts it on the coffee table, and reaches an arm over his head for the violin.
John: *grabs at the violin*
Sherlock: That's mine.
John: Nice to know you haven't lost the ability to speak. I was starting to wonder. *places the violin on the armchair*
Sherlock: *sneers unattractively*
John: She's seeing her ex, you know.
Sherlock: Sarah?
John: I thought something was going on.
Sherlock: The last sixteen days, as far as I can tell."
8,116314,John,Sherlock,"John: I thought something was going on.
Sherlock: The last sixteen days, as far as I can tell.
John: Last night, you said I was being obtuse. What am I missing?
Sherlock: *silent*
John: This hypothesis, what are the underlying assumptions?
Sherlock: You are the least annoying person I've met... Do I need to continue?
John: Yes.
Sherlock: You are reliable, responsible and considerate... You are not unattractive.
John: So you're saying, I'm a catch?
Sherlock: For a single woman your age, you would be an appealing prospective husband.
John: So how does this lead to you kissing me?
Sherlock: You talk fondly of your childhood.
John: You kissed me to stop me getting married, having children and moving to the countryside?
Sherlock: It would be detrimental to my work. But it's a working hypothesis. I'll find the correct approach."
9,116314,Sherlock,John,"Sherlock: But it's a working hypothesis. I'll find the correct approach.
John: The correct approach here is to get up, find his keys and go down to the local pub to watch whichever team is playing. A pint of Guinness would help, too.
Sherlock: It should have worked but it didn't. There must have been a flaw in my reasoning.
John: How many patches?
Sherlock: Only one. Less urgency than a case. A more distant deadline."
10,116314,John,Sherlock,"John: Maybe it would help if you talked it through?
Sherlock: I doubt it. From what I know about you, it should have been the perfect solution.
John: Maybe your assumptions were wrong. Maybe you overlooked certain facts.
Sherlock: Like?
John: Like the fact that I still have nightmares about combat and I don't sleep the whole night through. I have a shoulder that aches when it's cold and damp, which in London is all winter, and a psychosomatic limp.
Sherlock: You don't limp now.
John: At the clinic when I'm tired. Not around you.
Sherlock: Or it could be that you're bored at the clinic and discomforted by the normalcy of it, everyday people and their dull little everyday lives filled with coughs, colds and certificates for work.
John: It pays the bills.
Sherlock: Unnecessary.
John: Secondly, while women might talk about marrying a doctor, they mean the specialist who drives a BMW and holidays in the Alps. They don't mean the guy in his mid-thirties with a soldier's pension who needs a flatmate to live in London and uses his sister's hand-me-down phone.
Sherlock: Irrelevant.
John: What made you think that kissing me would stop me getting married?
Sherlock: Your sweater.
John: My sweater?
Sherlock: Not that particular one. The one you wore when we first looked at the flat. Oatmeal coloured, round-necked, Aran sweater. The colouring doesn't suit you, the shape itself is not flattering, but from the quality it was expensive. It was a gift someone bought for you. You could go out and buy another but it's warm and practical, so you wear it. It's convenience.
John: You think I'm too lazy to walk down the shop and buy myself a nicer jumper?
Sherlock: Not lazy, per se. Simply that the effort expended to purchase another isn't necessary when you already have a sweater that keeps you warm and does not require effort."
11,116314,John,Sherlock,"John: You think I'm too lazy to walk down the shop and buy myself a nicer jumper?
Sherlock: Not lazy, per se. Simply that the effort expended to purchase another isn't necessary when you already have a sweater that keeps you warm and does not require effort.
John: You were being convenient. You went shopping, you got Mrs Hudson to make me tea. You were waiting in my bed. You were making yourself the convenient option. If I'm too much of a lazy sod to go buy a new jumper, I'm too lazy to date other people when I've got sex on demand at home.
Sherlock: It should have worked. I made it quite clear that it required no change on your part, that it would simply fit into our established patterns. There shouldn't have been a problem.
John: But I asked why, which doesn't work with the path of least resistance approach to sex. You should have asked me about the jumper.
Sherlock: Really? Why?
John: It's not convenience. When I was deployed, I'd call mum when I could, every few weeks or so. I'd tell her I was fine and complain about the food and the weather. I mean, you can't complain about watching a twenty-year-old kid bleed out while you're under heavy fire or the career soldier you're sending home with one leg and burns to thirty percent of his body. You don't want people to worry. So you talk about the weather.
Sherlock: There's always something. It's so hard to be right about all the details.
John: Does it make a difference?
Sherlock: It says a great deal about what you consider worth keeping in your life. Emotional attachment is vastly different to convenience.
John: Sherlock?
Sherlock: It's perfectly logical, John. If emotional attachment is the main concern, then it's best to encourage an attachment to someone who grew up in London and has a vested interest in staying. Sarah takes personal pride in running the clinic and loves the city. While she has little personal fondness for me, she considers my work important and probably believes that you will save lives by helping me.
John: Sherlock?
Sherlock: You enjoy the danger of what we do. It stands to reason that as long as you were in London, you would find an excuse to be involved. If you had a spouse that supported this and didn't require you lying about where you were and what you were doing, you'd still be involved in the cases. I was too short-sighted, too focused on keeping you here, I should have known--
John: Sherlock!
Sherlock: We can deal with that. Romances with ex-lovers are notoriously fragile.
John: You can't break up Sarah's relationship to set me up with her."
12,116314,John,Sherlock,"John: Sherlock! Sarah's seeing someone else, remember?
Sherlock: We can deal with that. Romances with ex-lovers are notoriously fragile.
John: You can't break up Sarah's relationship to set me up with her. Well, obviously, you probably could but I'm telling you not to. Please.
Sherlock: It's the most logical solution, John.
John: How about... Just ask me to stay.
Sherlock: It's a very short-term answer. People stay as long as there is personal incentive for them. My expressed wish for you to stay would only influence your decisions until a more pressing emotional connection was formed with someone else.
John: Maybe you should man up. Maybe you should be the one I form an emotional connection with.
Sherlock: That wasn't a joke.
John: You like me. You think I'm the least annoying person in London.
Sherlock: I said the least annoying person I'd met. I really can't speak for the entire Greater London area. I simply meant that I endure your company more easily than anyone else's. It wasn't a vow of undying adoration.
John: And yet, you're sitting here concocting schemes to make me stay. Let's make this easy. I like you and I'd be fine with kissing you on a regular basis. So tell me you like me and you want me to stay, and then kiss me.
Sherlock: I think you're oversimplifying matters. Niccolo Machiavelli would approve of a slight amount of deception for the greater good of all, but that's not what most people mean when they say Machiavellian.
John: You're stalling.
Sherlock: I'm thinking.
John: Any time now.
Sherlock: I spend more time with you than I ever anticipated spending with a flatmate and despite all facts that should suggest otherwise, I find myself… I like you. Stay, *kisses John softly*"
