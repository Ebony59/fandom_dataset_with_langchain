0,11900241,Peter,Bucky,"Peter: Uh, hi?
Bucky: Just thought we ought to meet.
Peter: Why is he here?
Bucky: Hi, nice to meet you, please don’t kill me.
Peter: Sorry?
Bucky: I’d be nervous if I was him, too. He has been calling out my good buddy Steve on the internet.
Aunt May: Yeah, I’ve been meaning to talk to him about how we should treat our elders.
Peter: He deserved it.
Bucky: I’m not here to make your life miserable.
Peter: I’ve been publicly trashing your best friend, dude.
Bucky: You got a best friend?
Peter: Me and Stevie, we’ve been close for a real long time.
Peter: I’m listening.
Bucky: I understand you’re interested in some dirt.
Peter: Are you offering some?
Peter: Because I am all ears, my man.
Tony: Please tell me you didn’t hunt down Barnes.
Peter: He showed up here."
1,11900241,Peter,Barnes,"Peter: Please tell me you didn’t hunt down Barnes.
Tony: He showed up here.
Peter: He’s scary, but he wants to help me win against Captain America. Who better than someone who knows all the dirt?
Tony: I’m never going to like the guy, but I’ll tell you he’s at least safe to be around these days. I would tell you to stay away otherwise, capiche?
Peter: Capiche.
Tony: And never trust him.
Peter: *hangs up before Tony could do more than laugh at him*
Ned: Dude, I almost fell out of my freakin’ chair when I saw the Winter Soldier on your Insta.
Peter: I came home and he was here, just hanging out with Aunt May.
MJ: Why the hell would you trust Captain America’s best friend to help us?
Peter: It’s because he reminded me of you and that’s absolutely what you would do to us?
Ned: Well. I mean, you’re not wrong.
Ned: So the real question is, what do we do with him?
MJ: Too much, and we’re just going to look like dicks. And by we, I mean you.
Peter: Maybe we already won.
Ned: Yeah, I’m with the sidekick on this one.
MJ: Keep telling yourself that, Robin.
Peter: Robin’s actually really cool.
Ned: Where is your aunt? Did she run away with Bucky Barnes?"
2,11900241,Ned,Oracle,"Ned: And if anything, Ned would be Oracle, and she kicks ass.
MJ: Hell yeah she does.
MJ: *rolls her eyes and takes a piece of pizza, even though she was clearly thinking it inferior to the one she lost.*
Ned: Where is your aunt? Did she run away with Bucky Barnes?
Peter: She would have. She’s in her room, pretending to work but really she’s looking at pictures of Bucky Barnes on the internet. She’s got a crush.
MJ: Don’t we all?
Peter: *crinkling his nose* Peter’s life goes suspiciously well for the next few days. He remembered to do all of his homework, Flash was distracted by MJ’s academic decathlon reading schedule, he caught a pair of goons trying to rob a liquor store and Bucky sent him a short video of Captain America picking a wedgie, which instantly became the most popular gif on the internet.
Karen: There is an incoming call from the Scarlet Witch.
Peter: I am on my way to team up with the Scarlet Witch!
Peter: Ned, Ned, you’ll never believe it. I’m on my way to team up with the Scarlet Witch!
Ned: This is the best week ever.
Ned: Isn’t it… I mean, Peter my dude. Isn’t it a little suspicious that she’s calling you up out of the blue?
Peter: What? No. Don’t ruin this for me, Neddy. I need a win.
Peter: *rolls his eyes and hangs up.*
Peter: Scarlet Witch wasn’t going to be on Team Cap. She’d been cool with him the single time they’d met. Karen had given her the virtual thumbs up! It was going to be fine.
Wanda: We got intel that a Hydra cell has been coming and going from here.
Peter: Cool!
Peter: Could you climb up and open that window? I don’t want to cause any more property damage.
Peter: Probably a good idea.
Peter: Karen, what’s going on here?
Karen: There is a substance on the wall. A type of super-glue that adheres on contact.
Peter: Glue. I’m glued to the wall? Hey, Scarlet Witch, did you glue me to the freaking wall?
Wanda: *aiming her phone up at him and smiling* This is… Oh my god."
3,11900241,Peter,Scarlet Witch,"Peter: I’m glued to the wall?” *yelled over his shoulder* “Hey, Scarlet Witch, did you glue me to the freaking wall?”
Wanda: *aiming her phone up at him and smiling* “This is… Oh my god. Seriously uncool! I can’t believe you turned a building into a giant fly-strip!”
Natasha: *smiling up at him* “Have fun getting loose!”
Wanda: *calling up before climbing in with Natasha* “You deserve this!”
Peter: Karen, call Ned, please.
Ned: “Peter, you have the best timing, this is the most triumphant moment of my life.”
Peter: You were right.
Ned: “Damn right I am! What was I right about?”
Peter: It’s a trap!
Ned: *asking in a very careful voice* What happened?
Peter: I’m stuck to the side of a building. There are a few people down there taking pictures of me? This is a nightmare.
Ned: How can you be stuck? You already stick to buildings.
Peter: They coated it with glue, Ned. How the hell am I going to get down?
Ned: You’re not going to like my suggestion.
Peter: Lay it on me. I’m desperate here. I need to pee.
Ned: Well, are you glued to the wall, or is your suit glued to the wall?
Peter: You’re right, I don’t like this suggestion.
Peter: Karen, are there any other options? Like, is this glue soluble?
Karen: “Initial scans indicate that the adhesive is a Stark Industries prototype, so no.”
Peter: Ned, I’ve got to go.
Ned: Just remember, you’ve got abs now. Own it.
Peter: Tony is gonna kill me."
4,11900241,Peter,Tony,"Peter: Tony is gonna kill me.
Peter: Karen, call Ned back, please.
Ned: How are you going to get the suit back?
Peter: That is a problem for later.
Ned: Good plan. Zero chance of failure, right there.
Peter: You don't have to be right all the time.
MJ: Dude, I thought I made it clear I was your first line of defense. You gotta keep me in the know.
Peter: Um.
MJ: What, exactly, is on the internet?
Peter: Everything?
MJ: Namely, a mostly-naked you. Do you really not wear socks in the suit? Don't the boots get funky?
Peter: They get all bunched up and there's no way to pull them back up.
MJ: Also, nice undies. It's a bold choice, wearing your own face over your junk, but I respect that.
Peter: Oh no.
MJ: I feel like Tony Stark will be proud of you. He seems like the kind of guy to wear his own merch, too.
Peter: Let me die.
MJ: Don't be dramatic. Just because millions of people saw you in your Spidey-drawers--
Peter: Millions?
MJ: Peter, it's video of a superhero shedding his clothes and scampering up the side of a building in just his mask and underwear that have his name scrawled on the butt. It had its own segment on the Today show."
5,11900241,Aunt May,Peter,"Aunt May: Fun night?
Peter: This is your fault. You just had to buy me merch from that sketchy kiosk. I don't even get royalties from it.
Aunt May: You're the one who wore Spider-Man boxers out to go Spider-Manning. I didn't think I'd end up showing my underwear to the entire world.
Peter: If you're worried, it's okay if you don't have chest hair at your age. Aunt May, gross, stop!
Aunt May: Seriously, though, Petey-Pete, are you okay? No one knows it was you.
Peter: Except for the people who do. And probably this is going to replace the Port-a-Potty picture for the one they use when talking about Spider-Man on the news. But I'm okay. Just gotta get some serious revenge on Team Cap.
Aunt May: You went up a building because Captain America told you to?
Peter: No, because Scarlet Witch offered a team-up. She's working with Cap and Black Widow, apparently.
Aunt May: What's your game plan?
Peter: MJ says it's time to call in Barnes. She's right. Let her take lead on this one.
Aunt May: And at least it's not a school day. Get in front of this before Monday, alright? I don't want this to affect your grades.
Peter: Will do.

Ned: So you might be wondering why I gathered you here today.
Peter: We all know. We really don't have to rehash the events again.
MJ: I think we should. Because I want it on the record that I told you before you went that it was a terrible idea and you shouldn't.
Peter: Dude. Uncool.
MJ: Don't try to suppress the truth.
Peter: The important thing is, revenge.
Bucky: What sort of vengeance are you thinking?
MJ: That's where you come in. You're our key to an inside job.
Bucky: We have access to video feeds from the public spaces in the Avengers HQ.
MJ: We do?
Peter: Yep. I get bored when you're on patrol. A man can only binge so many shows.
Bucky: So you're going to want me to lure Steve into a public area.
MJ: Are you an amateur? He's going to be on red alert after the prank he pulled. I mean, Peter's lucky in that he's used to public humiliation. Someone with less..."
6,11900241,Bucky,Steve,"Bucky: So you’re going to want me to lure Steve into a public area.
MJ: Are you an amateur? He’s going to be on red alert after the prank he pulled. I mean, Peter’s lucky in that he’s used to public humiliation. Someone with less experience would still be hiding under their pillow. And you’re good but he’s got Black Widow on his side. No, you’re going to pick a public spot that he already goes to and you’re going to lay the trap.
Bucky: How many prank wars have you been in?
MJ: I’ve seen some shit. Now, we’ve progressed to physical pranks. Are you okay with this?
Bucky: Absolutely.
MJ: And your role has to be secret. No matter how tempting it is to make fun of him. Can you handle that?
Bucky: I think I can manage that.
Peter: But what are we going to do to him? We can’t exactly glue him to a wall.
MJ: Come on now, you’re innovative. That was funny because you can crawl up walls. No, in order to achieve prank greatness, we have to get a real reaction out of Cap. Think of some good locations, and I’ll get back to you on the specifics.

MJ: Damn right I am. This is war, Peter, and that man is on a need-to-know basis.
Ned: I have so much respect for you right now. I mean, it’s heavily theorized that the Winter Soldier killed JFK, and yet you just made him your prank war intern.
MJ: To be fair, he’s used to taking orders.
Peter: You two are never allowed in Avengers HQ. I’m not sure if we’d get a lifetime ban or our asses kicked, but something bad would happen.
MJ: It’s cool, that place is the soulless embodiment of the commodification of heroism.
Ned: Shut your mouth, you know it’s the coolest place we’ve never been invited. So is it just Bucky in the dark or are you going to share with the rest of us?
MJ: You’re in the know, no worries. Your job is to acquire a gallon of glitter.
Ned: MJ, you evil genius.
MJ: I know.

Peter: Guys, I forgot the suit. The ridiculously-expensive most important thing in my life! How did I not go back for the suit?
Ned: Dude, don’t answer it.
MJ: Chickenshit. *takes the phone out of Peter's hand*
MJ: What’s up, Stark?
Peter: *uses superpowers to listen in*
Tony: Hey there Chipette, I need to talk to Alvin about losing his sweater.
MJ: How’d you get it off the wall? I bet you just took the wall, didn’t you, and you’re going to hand Peter a new suit and pretend like it was the old one.
Tony: Of course not. That would be ridiculous.
MJ: Cool. Roll it in some corn chips before you hand it over and it’ll smell funky enough that he..."
7,11900241,Peter,Tony,"Peter: Did you get it off the wall? I bet you just took the wall, didn’t you, and you’re going to hand Peter a new suit and pretend like it was the old one.
Tony: Of course not. That would be ridiculous.
MJ: Cool. Roll it in some corn chips before you hand it over and it’ll smell funky enough that he’ll believe you.
Peter: MJ, Gimme the phone.
MJ: *flashes a winning smile and tosses his phone at him*
Peter: *puts it to his ear and starts apologizing immediately* I’m sorry, Mr. Stark, but--
Tony: Cool it, kid, I’m not the Spanish Inquisition. I’d give you more hell about abandoning the suit like that, but it sounds like you’re already catching it by the bucketful.
Peter: You have no idea. And also the internet saw my underwear, so. There’s that.
Tony: I remember my first time getting papped in my skivvies. I was in a hardware store. Good times. Of course, I didn’t have the foresight to make sure to advertise my brand at the same time, so obviously you kids today are ahead of the game.
Peter: Yes, absolutely, ahead of the game, that’s what I was thinking. Thanks for rescuing my suit.
Tony: Someone’s gotta pick up after you. Though the next time I see it just lying around…
Peter: Yeah, yeah. I’ll pick up after myself next time.
Tony: Now, more importantly, are you going to get back at Cap? Because I gotta say, he’s been super smug today. I don’t want to make you self-conscious but there’s a very unflattering picture of you currently hanging in the lobby here.
Peter: Dude, it’s your building, can’t you take it down?
Tony: I mean, in theory I could, but it’s pretty entertaining. And good for morale and all that jazz.
Peter: *hangs up* You’re welcome. We’re moving the timetable up.
Ned: I think these will work. Is this enough? I mean, MJ wants this to be epic.
Peter: I think it will be. I think the red and blue glitter is a great touch.
Ned: Avengers HQ is going to sparkle forever. This will be your legacy.
Peter: All we have to do is deliver these bad boys to Barnes and we’re set.
Bucky: *sabotages the common kitchen*
Steve: *enters the kitchen just past daybreak*"
8,11900241,Peter,Ned,"Peter: We got Spider-ed.
Ned: This is without a doubt the greatest day of our lives.
MJ: Keep going, my favorite bit is coming up.
Natasha: *leaning casually against the counter*
Ned: Glitter revenge part deux. We need to get this shit online.
Peter: That went even better than planned. Bucky really came through.
MJ: Glitter is the most savage art supply. You don't do that to someone lightly.
Peter: They're probably still trying to get it off. I mean, that was so much glitter. Will it ever come off?
Ned: They're probably going to have to burn the kitchen down and start again.
Peter: Good work, guys. We absolutely just won this prank war.
Peter: I'm so proud -TS
Peter: *shrieking happily and waving the laptop over his head like a four year old on Christmas*"
9,11900241,Peter,Tony,"Peter: It was a glorious new laptop, far more powerful than Peter’s current rigged-up one. Upon closer inspection it wasn’t even anything that was on the market yet, and Peter realized it was one of Tony’s personal prototypes. *He hugged it to himself and sent Tony a video of himself shrieking happily and waving the laptop over his head like a four year old on Christmas.*
Peter: The glitterbombing didn’t quite break the internet, but Spider-Man’s indecent exposure was dropped from the news cycles in favor of a sparkling, foul-mouthed Captain America, and Peter was eternally thankful. There was reference to Spider-Man’s public humiliation, but Captain America was, well, Captain America, and Peter felt confident in the knowledge that he had totally won.
Flash: “I think the best part was he named the meme himself this time,” Flash told Betty loudly in Chem. “That’s legendary, right there. That’s why he’s a true hero.”
Betty: “I bet he’s still sparkling,” Betty said thoughtfully. “One time I accidentally used lotion with body glitter in it and I sparkled for a week.”
Peter: Peter smiled down at his laptop. He was still bringing his trusty old one to school, unwilling to chance anything happening to the one Tony had gifted him with. His phone buzzed, somehow seeming urgent, and he dug it out of his pocket to see that Tony was calling him. “Can I be excused?” Peter said, shoving the phone back into his pocket and sticking his hand in the air. “It’s an emergency.”
Teacher: His teacher waved him out, and he hurried out of the room, answering his phone as soon as he was safely in the hall.
Peter: “Yeah, Mr. Stark? Do you need me?”
Tony: “I need you to tell me if there are any more glitter bombs planted in Avengers HQ,” Tony said. “There’s been an incident.”
Peter: “Um,” Peter said, “Just the one in the couch?”
Tony: “Found that one,” Tony said. “Or, I should say, Bruce found that one.”
Peter: Peter slumped against a locker, stomach twisting. “That’s… that’s not good.”
Tony: “It turns out that the Hulk likes sparkles,” Tony said, “and we avoided any major structural damage. The couch is a goner, though.”
Peter: “That was the last one,” Peter said weakly.
Tony: “Good,” Tony said. He paused. “When you put it online, you should give it a kicky soundtrack. Something upbeat.”
Peter: “So you’re not mad?” Peter said.
Tony: “Pepper says it’s actually my fault for encouraging the delinquency of minors,” Tony said. “As long as you’re sure that’s the last one, we’re golden.”
Peter: “We’re golden,” Peter agreed.
Peter: Peter peered over MJ’s shoulder at lunch. “Are you… are you texting Bucky Barnes right now?”
MJ: “We have a spiritual connection,” MJ deadpanned. The conversation appeared to be entirely gifs of adorable puppies tripping over their own feet.
Peter: “I thought you were a cat person,” Peter said.
MJ: “I am,” MJ said. Peter didn’t bother trying; as far as he could tell, MJ was the closest thing to a mysterious oracle that existed at Midtown High. Getting anything out of her was like pulling teeth.
Peter: “So I guess we trust him now?”
MJ: “He did publically humiliate his best friend for us without telling him,” MJ said. “He seems pretty solid.”
Peter: “Fair,” Peter said, scooting over as Ned arrived to give him a better spot. He remembered his phone call with Tony. “Guys, we miscalculated slightly.”
Ned: Ned’s face after Peter told him about the Hulk was a thing of wonder. “Wait, are we now going to have to fight the Hulk? The man is a scientist."
10,11900241,MJ,Peter,"MJ: He seems pretty solid.
Peter: Fair. *scooting over as Ned arrived to give him a better spot* Guys, we miscalculated slightly.
Ned: Wait, are we now going to have to fight the Hulk? The man is a scientist. He’ll out-science us every day of the week.
MJ: I don’t think knowing science is a prerequisite of winning. And you’re missing the salient point.
Ned: Which is?
MJ: We have our follow-up video.
Peter: *thinking* Bucky was around a lot more -- trading books and snark with MJ, letting Ned prod at his newly constructed arm, and, most alarmingly, taking Aunt May out for lunch while they were in school.
Bucky: It would be hard to top. *after they all decided that fro-yo was needed after school* Captain America doesn’t seem like a quitter.
Peter: Well, you do have the advantage of having a secret identity, and I don’t think he’d be enough of a dick to compromise it.
MJ: Probably not.
Bucky: So just stay away from superheroes. You managed it really well for most of your run as Spider-Man.
Peter: Thanks, man. Appreciate it.
MJ: I wouldn’t be your friend if I lied to you.
MJ: So why are you here? I mean, I appreciate the scenery, don’t get me wrong, but don’t you have better things to do?
Bucky: I don’t exactly have a job. And your problems are less fraught than everyone else’s.
Peter: But why are you taking Aunt May to lunch so much?
Bucky: *giving him a shit-eating grin* *Peter throws a balled-up napkin at the Winter Soldier*
Bucky: *insinuated himself so smoothly into their lives that, a week later when he asked if Peter would meet him in Brooklyn, none of the three thought anything of it.*
MJ: I bet he just can’t figure out how to work his tv. Old farts struggle with that sort of thing.
Peter: *hoping to go on a real mission with the Avengers again* I wanted very much to go on a real mission with the Avengers again.
Peter: *realizing he was locked inside some random superhero-proofed apartment in Brooklyn* Awesome."
11,11900241,MJ,Ned,"MJ: He infiltrated us, *betrayed, on speaker on the other end.*
Ned: We really dropped the ball, *said. I mean. It's the Winter Soldier. We really should have had our guard up for sneaky tactics.*
Peter: I'm so stupid, *said. Of course Bucky Barnes wouldn't turn on Steve Rogers. There are actual books written about their friendship. They are such great friends that people write freakin' dissertations on them. We deserve to lose.*
MJ: You haven't lost yet, *said fiercely*. Don't do what he says.
Peter: Guys, *he said*, We've definitely lost. I've got to go.
Cap: Who-- Spider-Man? *he said, clearly at a loss*. Here to gloat?
Peter: I wish, *he said*. Did your bestest buddy lock you in there?
Cap: While working for your team... *Cap began, but trailed off*. Oh no. He's not working for you, is he?
Peter: The whole apartment is sealed, *he said*. I think he's gone rogue.
Cap: I knew that things were going too smoothly, *Cap said*, which isn't how Peter would have described things, given that still glittered slightly when the light hit him just right.
Peter: I can't believe I trusted him, *Peter said*. He even took my aunt out to eat, and it was all she would talk about for days. She's had a history-crush on him for as long as I can remember.
Cap: *Cap blinked*, but obviously chose not to comment on Bucky's commitment to his long game. Peter decided to help him out by holding out his phone and letting Cap read the instructions Bucky had left for them. He sighed. Are we sure there's no way out?
Peter: I mean, we can try, *Peter said*, but short of destroying the apartment, which Bucky was sure to mention belongs to a charitable organization and thus that would be an asshole move, I think we have to go with it.
Cap: It is poetic justice, *Cap mused*. And if I know Buck, he really won't let us out until we've done it.
Peter: *Peter nodded*; he had the same impression and he'd only known Bucky a hot minute. About the ceasefire...
Cap: I think it's the smartest thing Buck had in there, *Cap said*. This has been the most fun I've had in ages, but it's getting a bit public.
Peter: A bit? *Peter said*. You saw how much of me was public.
Cap: *Captain America snickered*. At him. Peter was very glad that his mask completely hid how much he was blushing. Sorry, pal, I didn't actually think about how you would get off the wall. If"
12,11900241,Peter,Captain America,"Peter: “This has been the most fun I’ve had in ages, but it’s getting a bit public.”
Captain America: “A bit?”
Peter: “You saw how much of me was public.”
Captain America: *snickers at Peter*
Peter: *blushing behind his mask* “Sorry, pal, I didn’t actually think about how you would get off the wall. If it makes you feel better, Nat was so cranky about the glitter that she dumped all the excess in my underwear drawer. I didn’t notice until too late.”
Peter: *laughs* “Man, I recruited the wrong former assassin.”
Captain America: “Thank goodness.” *holds out his hand* “Truce?”
Peter: *shakes Captain America's hand firmly* “Truce. Now…”
Captain America: *nods* “I guess we should just get it over with?”
Peter: *agrees* *starts to record*
Captain America: “Remember, friendship is a journey. Sometimes it starts out on rocky footing.”
Spider-Man: “Sometimes you have to overcome differences and embarrassing mistakes.”
Captain America: *turns towards Spider-Man*
Spider-Man: *stands on tip-toes and gets smooshed into Captain America’s shoulder* “You can always hug it out.”"
