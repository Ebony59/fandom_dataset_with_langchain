0,12007524,Harry,Severus,"Harry: I expect to win the Quidditch Cup this year, Mr. Potter. Severus’s complaints are most entertaining.
Harry: Oh, you can count on it, Professor. I won’t let you down.
McGonagall: See that you don’t, Mr. Potter.
Ron: Congratulations, Harry!
Hermione: Well done, Harry. You deserve it."
1,12007524,Ron,Harry,"Ron: “Congratulations, Harry!” *said with food in his mouth*

Hermione: “Well done, Harry. You deserve it.” *didn’t look up from her book*

Harry: *whispered* “Coward.”

Cho Chang: “Are we going to have DA meetings this year, Harry?”

Harry: “No.” *without looking at her*

Harry: “Not everything is about you, Malfoy.”

Draco Malfoy: “Oh?”

Harry: *sat next to Daphne* “Potter! You almost sat on me!” *Pansy Parkinson shrieked*

Harry: “Don’t be melodramatic, Heiress Parkinson.”

Pansy Parkinson: “Sorry.”"
2,12007524,Pansy,Harry,"Pansy: Sorry, *whispered, cheeks pinking.*
Harry: Apology accepted, *said Harry as he continued to toss and catch the badge.*

Pansy: If you’re not here to pick a fight with Draco, why are you here? *gaze narrowed at him.*
Harry: *grinned, reached over, captured one of Daphne’s fringe curls, tugged it straight, and then watched it bounce back into place.*

Daphne: My hair doesn’t exist to entertain you, Harry.
Harry: Daphne, everything about you exists to entertain me, *Harry said with a charming grin.*

Daphne: Entertain? *hissed, as if his word choice offended her.*
Harry: Amuse. Entrance. Please. Captivate. Taunt. Tease. Torture, *Harry listed, before winking at her.*

Harry: *let her catch his hand, and then flipped it over and intertwined his fingers with hers before she could object.*
Daphne: And you, apparently, exist to torture me.

Daphne: What do you want, Harry?
Harry: You.
Daphne: What?

Harry: But I should talk to your dad about that first, *Harry said.*
Harry: So I’ll settle for your company at a picnic by the Black Lake for lunch today.

Daphne: I’m not going on a date with you, *she hissed.*
Harry: Of course you aren’t, *Harry agreed.*

Harry: I’m asking you on a pre-Courtship Date. Hedwig can only fly so fast, you know. It’ll be hours before your dad agrees."
3,12007524,Harry,Daphne,"Harry: “I’m asking you on a pre-Courtship Date. Hedwig can only fly so fast, you know. It’ll be hours before your dad agrees that I’m the perfect wizard for you. You’re not going to make me wait until tomorrow to go on a picnic with you, are you? Because that would be cold, Daphne. Cold and cruel.”
Daphne: “You are incorrigible.”
Harry: “I’m not sure what ‘corrigible’ is, but I don’t think I’ve ever been in it. I am, however, madly in love.”
Daphne: “If this is a joke, Harry, I’m going to tell the president of your fan club that you’re too shy to confess your deep and abiding love for her.”
Harry: “No joke.”
Daphne: “Then I suppose it wouldn’t hurt to allow you the pleasure of my company for a picnic lunch.”
Harry: “Thank you, my lady.”
Draco: “Hey, Draco.”
Harry: “Can you sacrifice a meal with your adoring minions to chaperone my pre-Courtship Date with Daphne?”
Draco: “Why should I?”
Harry: “You know what, I just remembered that your father agreed to spy on Voldemort for me. I’m sure Minister Scrimgeour would fall all over himself in his rush to release your father from Azkaban and into my custody.”
Draco: “I suppose I could endure a picnic in your presence, Harry.”"
4,12007524,Harry,Draco,"Harry: It was so brave of him to agree, especially considering how much he suffered in the last war while under the Imperius.
Draco: I suppose I could endure a picnic in your presence, Harry.
Harry: Of course.
Daphne: Have some faith, Daphne. I haven’t finished providing appropriate chaperones, yet.
Daphne: If you ask Miss Weasley, I’ll have to remember I’ve already made lunch plans with Pansy. I don’t want to go on a pre-Courtship Date and watch another witch fawn all over you.
Harry: *rubbed the back of Daphne’s hand with his thumb and leaned over the table* Lady Astoria, do you think you could tolerate Draco’s presence long enough to help me win your sister’s heart?
Astoria: It would be my pleasure, Heir Harry!
Harry: Brilliant!
Harry: What had Harry been afraid of all this time? Why had he waited so long to declare his intentions? Daphne was a witch worth fighting for, as his mum had been.
Harry: You’ve overstayed your welcome, Mr. Potter, Snape said, peering down his hooked nose at Harry. I suggest you take that—Snape pointed at the Quidditch Captain badge that Harry had dropped on the floor at some point—and go to class, before I start deducting points.
Harry: Sure thing, Professor."
5,12007524,Snape,Harry,"Snape: “You’ve overstayed your welcome, Mr. Potter. I suggest you take that and go to class, before I start deducting points.”
Harry: “Sure thing, Professor.”

Harry: “What’s your policy about kissing on a pre-Courtship Date?”

Harry’s thoughts: Daphne’s answer replayed in Harry’s mind as he licked his lips.
Daphne’s answer: “Only if you taste like treacle tarts.”"
