0,12378879,Hermione,Fred,"Hermione: Alright, *Hermione replied.*
Fred: To be honest: I'm having trouble sleeping. Have been since we all heard about Ginny. *Fred turned to her, the usual mischievous glint in his eye gone. The new, serious Fred was a bit alarming.* George and I never got the chance to say thank you. At the feast.
Hermione: I hardly did anything. Harry and Ron went into the Chamber- *Hermione ducked her head so Fred wouldn't see her blush.*
Fred: Oh that's bollocks and you know it, *Fred admonished*"
1,12378879,Fred,Hermione,"Fred: “George and I never got the chance to say thank you. At the feast.”
Hermione: “I hardly did anything. Harry and Ron went into the Chamber-”
Fred: “Oh that’s bollocks and you know it. You did all the research. You solved the mystery. If it wasn’t for you then Hogwarts would be shut down for good and Ginny’d-”
Hermione: “How is Ginny, by the way?”
Fred: “She’s sharing a bed with me and George, actually. Said she didn’t want to face all of the girls in her room after everything that happened. She’s probably just after our sweets collection.”
Hermione: *laughs*
Fred: “What are you doing down here? Couldn’t sleep?”
Hermione: “Didn’t want to sleep. I spent too much time on that hospital bed. I wanted to spend a little while longer awake.”
Fred: “Well if you want to avoid sleep, you should come by the Burrow this summer. Never a dull moment in our house. You won’t sleep a wink. I guarantee it.”
Hermione: “Well if your mother is alright with it, I might just have to take you up on that offer.”
Fred: “Alright Granger?”
Hermione: *nods*
Fred: “Blimey, Granger. You trying to kill yourself?”
Hermione: “I’m only trying to map out my study plan from now until at least Christmas. Tomorrow I’ll work it out until Easter.”
Hermione: “How was Egypt? I heard from Ron and Ginny but I didn’t hear anything about it from you.”
Fred: “It was brilliant. Hot. George and I were unsuccessful in shutting up Percy in a tomb. Or was it a temple?”
Hermione: *hits his arm*
Fred: “It was brilliant seeing Bill and Charlie again.”
Hermione: “I hope I get to meet them one day.”
Fred: “You would have loved Egypt. You probably could have told us more than any of the tour guides. There was the little bookshop and I found a book you would have loved. Didn’t have enough money to buy it, though.”
Hermione: “Fred, That’s-”
Fred: “Yeah, so I just decided to knick it instead,”
Hermione: *gasps*
Fred: “Of course I didn’t. Bill saw me eyeing it and bought it for me. Happy birthday.”
Hermione: *surprised*"
2,12378879,Fred,Hermione,"Fred: Of course I didn’t, *said cheekily*. Bill saw me eyeing it and bought it for me. Happy birthday.
Hermione: *never knew that Fred knew when her birthday was*. Even if she had, who would have thought that Fred Weasley would get her a present?
Fred: Sorry it’s not prettier wrapping, *apologized*.
Hermione: *shook her head* as she undid the string, did away with the paper and revealed the title.
Hermione: Magical Discoveries of Ancient Egypt and the Witches and Wizards Behind Them, *read aloud*. Fred this looks wonderful. Thank you! Hermione reached over and hugged Fred. After a moment Fred’s arms slowly wrapped around her to reciprocate.
Fred: You’re welcome.
Fred: Alright, Granger? *Fred already knew the answer*. Hermione sniffled and rubbed her eyes.
Hermione: No. No, I am not alright and I’d very much appreciate it if you left me alone.
Fred: *wasn’t going to do that, of course*. He sat down next to Hermione at her preferred table in the common room. Was it my brother? Do George and I need to hex his toenails off? Make hair sprout from his ears to his toes? Punch him?
Hermione: *shook her head*, although Fred detected a small, watery smile. No. It’s something I did and Harry and Ron are refusing to speak to me.
Fred: *frowned*. That didn’t sound right. Well, what happened? To his surprise, fresh tears welled in Hermione’s eyes and she shook her head.
Hermione: If I tell you, then you’ll hate me, too! *Hermione whimpered*. And so will George, and Wood, and the whole Quidditch team.
Fred: *So it had to do with Quidditch*. I promise, that if you tell me, I will listen to your side of the story and everything you have to say.
Hermione: And you won’t hate me? *Hermione said quietly*.
Fred: Well I can’t promise that! *He backpedaled when he saw Hermione’s lip quiver*. Bad joke! Bad joke! I won’t hate you, I promise!
Hermione: *She cried*. I knew you’d hate me.
Fred: I never said that! *Fred protested*. Look, you did the right thing, Granger. Harry and Ron know it, too. They’re just too pig-headed to admit it. So keep your chin up. Everything will right as rain with those two soon.
Hermione: *smiled*. Sure, her eyes and nose were still red from crying, but she was smiling again and if she was feeling better, then Fred was feeling better. He grinned at her.
Fred: But seriously, Granger. A Firebolt? *He gladly took the punch to his arm*, if it would help Hermione feel better.
Fred: Alright, Granger? *Fred had found her reading a book (of course) in the corner of the tent*. Smiling, she tucked her bookmark in between the pages. Excited for the match?
Hermione: Yes, actually, *Hermione said*. Fred’s smile was infectious. She found herself echoing it. I’m curious to see how professional Quidditch differs from the games I’ve seen at school.
Fred: Well, *Fred said*, puffing out his chest. For one thing, the Beaters aren’t nearly as handsome as me.
Hermione: And George, *Hermione added*. They were, after all, twins.
Fred: No, just me. *Hermione snorted*. Poor Georgie. I got the looks and the brains. You and I should make a club. Exclusive to witches and wizards who are smart and..."
3,12378879,Fred,Hermione,"Fred: Well, for one thing, the Beaters aren't nearly as handsome as me.
Hermione: And George.
Fred: No, just me.
Hermione: Poor Georgie. I got the looks and the brains. You and I should make a club. Exclusive to witches and wizards who are smart and beautiful. Unfortunately that only means the two of us for now.
Hermione: I think you've been hit in the head with a few too many bludgers.
Fred: Nonsense. Don't worry: I'll work on the buttons and the t-shirts. You just get to plan our club's first outing. That's upside down by the way.
Hermione: *flips the book back the right way*
Fred: Alright Granger?
Hermione: Hello, Fred. Do you think you could reach that book for me?
Fred: *complies with the request*
Fred: Transfiguration? Thought so. I didn't do too bad with that part of class. Did you need any help?
Hermione: Not yet, but if I run into trouble, you'll be the first person I ask.
Fred: Huh. Normally George and I aren't the ones people think of when they're in a spot of trouble.
Hermione: *laughs*
Fred: So listen, Hermione. You know about the Yule Ball? Of course you know about the Yule Ball. Anyway, I was wondering if you might want to go. With me.
Hermione: Oh, Fred. Someone asked me already. Just yesterday. I said yes.
Fred: No problem. *walks away*
Hermione: Fred?
Fred: *stops*
Hermione: If you had asked me first... I would've said yes.
Hermione: Alright, Fred?
Fred: Is Krum not being a gentleman? George and I can try to teach him a lesson for you. But I'll be honest: I don't think we can take him.
Hermione: No. It's not Krum.
Fred: *offers his hand*
Hermione: *takes his hand*
Fred: *leads her out on to the dance floor*
Hermione: I fought with Ron. According to him, I'm fraternizing with the enemy.
Fred: He's just jealous. He asked you to the ball at the last minute, you already had a date, and now nobody can take their eyes off you. I might not be able to take Krum but I could hex Ron for you?
Hermione: *shakes her head*
Hermione: If anybody's going to be hexing Ron, it'll be me."
4,12378879,Hermione,Fred,"Hermione: He’s just jealous. He asked you to the ball at the last minute, you already had a date, and now nobody can take their eyes off you.” *He spun her before speaking again.* “I might not be able to take Krum but I could hex Ron for you?”
Fred: I’ll provide you with an alibi if need be.” *He sighed.* “Ron’s an idiot, Hermione. He’s my brother, but he’s an idiot.”
Hermione: “The worst thing is that he expected me to just be waiting around dateless. He spent all that time mooning over Fleur and then it was unfathomable to him that I should already have a date.” *She shook her head.* “I don’t want to talk or think about him anymore. Tell me something. Anything.”
Fred: “You look beautiful.”
Hermione: “Thank you,” *she said quietly.* “Where’s Angelina?”
Fred: “Off with Katie and George,” *Fred dipped her and brought her back up again. A little closer than before.* “Apparently I spent too much of my evening staring.”
Hermione: “At who?” *She knew the answer. In that moment there were no other dancers, no other students. Just them.*
Viktor: “May I cut in?”
Fred: *Fred smiled, though it looked a little strained to Hermione.* He bowed dramatically to her with a cheerful “Milady!” and walked away from the champion and his date.
Hermione: *Hermione watched him leave the Great Hall. It wasn’t until after he had disappeared through the doorways that she realized she had been staring and had rudely been ignoring Viktor all this time.*
Hermione: “Care to dance?”
Viktor: “Go.” He said. “You can still catch him, Herm-owninny.”
Hermione: *Hermione turned on her heel and ran.*
Hermione: “Fred!” *up the staircase.*
Fred: “I thought you were still at the ball.”
Hermione: “I was,” *Hermione gasped. “I was.”*
Fred: “Well, what are you doing running all the way here, then?”
Hermione: *Hermione marched up the rest of the steps to Fred, pulled him down by the collar and kissed him soundly.* When she pulled away a moment later, Fred Weasley was, for the first time ever, completely speechless.
Hermione: “Good night!” *She turned and bounded down the stairs, leaving behind a very shocked but very pleased Fred Weasley.*"
5,12378879,Hermione,Fred,"Hermione: Good night! *hurriedly leaves*
Fred: Alright, Granger? *concerned*
Hermione: I'll be fine in a little bit. I just have to let the ointment work. *assuring him*
Fred: Well of course he's heartbroken. You sneaking around with Fleur behind his back? That's low, Granger. *teasing*
Hermione: You're only saying that because you know I can't hit you right now. *accusing*
Fred: Nice try. I'm too clever to respond to that. Mind if I take a look? *indicating her hand*
Hermione: *nods in assent*
Fred: Remind me never to break Harry's heart. Even if it is just nasty gossip. *thoughtful*
Fred: Pomfrey will have my head if she sees what I'm doing. *explaining*
Hermione: What is that? *curious*
Fred: Well it may come as no surprise to you that George and I do a great job of injuring ourselves quite often. As a result, we've become rather talented at anything to help us heal faster. Potions, powders, ointments, you name it. *explaining*
Hermione: Thank you. *grateful*
Fred: How does it feel?
Hermione: A little tingly. But definitely nowhere near as painful as before.
Fred: Ready to get out of here?
Fred: So I was wondering if it won't break Harry's or Krum's hearts, I was wondering if you might like to go to the next Hogsmeade visit. With me. *asking*
Hermione: *slides her bandaged hand into Fred's rough and calloused one*"
6,12378879,Fred,Hermione,"Fred: So I was wondering, if it won't break Harry's or Krum's hearts, I was wondering if you might like to go to the next Hogsmeade visit. With me.
Hermione: *slides her bandaged hand into Fred's rough and calloused one* I'd like that.

Fred: *writes to his mother later that night* He told her not to believe the rags. Harry had no feelings for Hermione and Hermione definitely had no feelings for either Harry or Krum. He stopped short of telling her that Hermione-and-Fred were on their way to becoming a real, legitimate couple. She wouldn't believe that if Merlin himself rose from the grave and told her."
