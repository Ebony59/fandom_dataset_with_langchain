0,12634773,Clint Barton,Tony Stark,"Clint Barton: Hey, Tony, have you noticed anything weird going on lately?
Tony Stark: Hmm, can't say that I have. Why?
Clint Barton: Well, I've been eavesdropping on some conversations and I think there's a conspiracy happening.
Tony Stark: A conspiracy? What are you talking about?
Clint Barton: I think Peter and the rest of the Avengers are plotting something behind our backs.
Tony Stark: That's ridiculous, Clint. Peter is just a kid, he wouldn't do something like that.
Clint Barton: I know it sounds crazy, but I've heard them talking about secret meetings and code names. It's all very suspicious.
Tony Stark: Alright, let's say you're right. What do you suggest we do?
Clint Barton: We need to confront them and find out what they're up to. We can't let them get away with this.
Tony Stark: Fine, but let's not jump to conclusions. We'll talk to Peter and the others and see what they have to say.
Clint Barton: Agreed. We'll get to the bottom of this, Tony. Just you wait."
1,12634773,Tony,Clint,"Tony: You know, when I said you could help out more, this isn’t what I meant.
Clint: Who’s Tony talking to?
Natasha: No clue.
Tony: What I said- I didn’t say you could skip school! I do not need another call from May complaining about you getting detentions because you leave whenever you feel like it!
Clint: Why is Tony talking to a child?
Steve: What’s everyone doing out here? We’re supposed to be having a team meeting.
Clint: Tony’s on the phone.
Tony: More important than your life? You’re my responsibility. How are you supposed to go to a good college when you keep skipping school? When I was your age, I was already going to MIT.
Tony: Look, kid, I gotta go. Just stay in school and don't do anything I would do, okay?
Clint: You don’t think-
Natasha: I do think.
Thor: Greetings, friends! Why are you all standing in the hallway?
Natasha: Thor! What are you doing?
Clint: We’re trying to be discreet. You can’t yell when you’re being discreet!
Tony: What’s this about discretion? Geez, what’s with you guys? You’re… jumpy, this evening.
Clint: Nothing, nothing, we were doing absolutely nothing- ow!"
2,12634773,Tony,Clint,"Tony: “What’s this about discretion?” *startling the group* “Geez, what’s with you guys? You’re… jumpy, this evening.”
Clint: “Nothing, nothing,” *explained hurriedly* “We were doing absolutely nothing- ow!” *yelped as Natasha elbowed him in the ribs.*
Steve: “I came to get everyone for a team meeting.”
Tony: “Another one?” *let out a drawn out sigh* “Let’s get this over with. I have things to do.” *walked ahead of them toward the elevators.*
Natasha: “And you call yourself a spy.”
Clint: “Well sorry,” *muttered back* “I didn’t see you coming up with a better excuse.”

Tony: “Show me your blueprints, kid. Tell me what you’re thinking,” *said to Peter as he cleared off a workbench by using his arm to sweep all of the items off of the surface and onto the floor.*
Peter: “Um… I don’t really know, Mr. Stark. I didn’t really have a plan yet.”
Tony: “Well, I have plenty of options for you in my old files you can look at. See if any speak to you.” *flicked an electronic file off of his tablet and onto the holographic screen in front of them.* “Pick one and I’ll talk you through it.” *It would seem Tony was more excited about this venture than Peter was.*
Peter: “Uh,” *mumbled awkwardly* “This is great and all, Mr. Stark, but I think I should probably come up with my own idea instead of just making one of yours.”
Tony: “No problem, kid, but you better come up with something fast. It’s due in a week and you haven’t even started.” *began pulling out all of his tools, or rather picking them up from where he threw them on the floor moments earlier.*
Peter: “How do you know when my science fair is? I never even told you.”
Tony: “The same way I know about the detentions.” *leaned in close to Peter’s face* “I know everything.”
FRIDAY: “Actually, Boss only knows because your Aunt May called him asking if he would help you with your science project, Peter.”
Tony: “Keep this up, FRIDAY, and you’ll be getting reprogrammed later.”
Clint: “No way!” *he gasped.*
Clint: “Moving on.” *Tony turned to Peter.* “Now back to your project.”

Natasha: “Give the remote, bird brain!” *growled as she attempted to dislocate his elbow to retrieve the device from him.*
Clint: “Never!” *yelled back dramatically, clutching*"
3,12634773,Natasha,Clint,"Natasha: “Give the remote, bird brain!” *attempted to dislocate his elbow to retrieve the device from him.*
Clint: “Never!” *yelled back dramatically, clutching the remote to his chest and rolling away from her.*
Steve: “Stop! Is that… Is that Tony?”
Bruce: *looked up from the book* “Wait, that was him. Turn it back for a second.”
Clint: *clicks the button on the remote, changing it back to the previous channel.*
Reporter: “-Stark was spotted today at Midtown School of Science and Technology attending their science fair,”
Clint: “I know why he was there!”
Natasha: “Are you going to tell us why he was there or make us wait in suspense some more?”
Clint: “There! That kid! I saw him in Tony’s lab last week. Tony was helping him make his project.”
Steve: “Why would Tony help some random kid with his science project?”
Natasha: “That’s weird even for Tony.”
Clint: “Remember that phone conversation we heard a few weeks ago? Where Tony was talking to a kid about skipping school? I think this is that kid. In the lab he mentioned the same detentions again. It’s gotta be him!”
Bruce: “Why would he not?”
Thor: “He is spreading his knowledge to this Midgardian child. That is a very noble cause!”
Steve: “Thor, an adult man spending too much time with a random child is considered stalking, so it’s not exactly noble so much as it is creepy and concerning.”
Clint: “Seemingly random kid comes out of nowhere that Tony is suddenly investing a lot of time and effort into? Does that not ring any bells for any of you?”
Natasha: “Explain.”
Clint: “Random kid who would have born when Tony was in his twenties or thirties, back when he was still a playboy… Tony suddenly not only spends time with this kid but lectures him about school and college? Getting any hints now?”
Steve: “You’re not saying he’s-”
Natasha: “No, I had to do deep research when I went undercover as his assistant. I would know if he had a secret kid.”
Clint: “Not if Tony didn’t know either.”
Natasha: “Yes, I would.”"
4,12634773,Natasha,Clint,"Natasha: No, I had to do deep research when I went undercover as his assistant. I would know if he had a secret kid.
Clint: Not if Tony didn't know either.
Natasha: *looked at him and deadpanned* Yes, I would.
Clint: Well, you may not believe me now, but just wait until I gather more evidence. Then you'll have to believe me.
Natasha: Alright, you go do that. *dropped her hold on him*
Clint: Thank you. My hand was starting to fall asleep.

Peter: Oh my god, are you okay?
Steve: Deep breaths, kid. It's alright. I'm fine. Are you?
Peter: Yeah, I'm fine. I'm stronger than I look.
Steve: *chuckles* So what are you doing up here?
Peter: Oh, uh... I'm part of the Stark Internship. Mr. Stark told me to meet him in his lab to work on something.
Steve: Well, you're on the wrong floor for that. His lab is a few floors down. Ask FRIDAY and she'll help you get there.
Peter: It is? Oh. Thanks.
Steve: Sure, kid. Got a pen and something for me to sign?
Peter: *shrugs off his backpack and begins digging through it*
Steve: I didn't catch your name.
Peter: Peter. Peter Parker.
Steve: *writes a short but sweet message before signing his name and drawing a quick shield next to it* Here you go, kid.
Peter: Thank you so much, Mr. Rogers."
5,12634773,Peter,Natasha,"Peter: “Uh, I don’t know. Whatever floor Mr. Stark’s lab is on.”
Natasha: “That would be floor 31.”
Peter: *staring at Natasha* “So… I like your… outfit?”
Natasha: “Thanks.”
Natasha: “You said you were going to Tony’s lab, right?”
Peter: “Yeah… I’m a part of the Stark Internship. I’m here so he can teach me about...stuff.”
Natasha: “I see.”
Natasha: “What’s your name?”
Peter: “It’s Peter, Sorry, gotta go. Bye.”
Bruce: “Can I help you?”"
6,12634773,Bruce Banner,Peter Parker,"Bruce: Can I help you?
Peter: You… You’re Dr. Bruce Banner! There’s a picture of you in my physics class!
Bruce: What?
Peter: You did a lot of work on anti-electron collisions! It’s so cool! I’ve read all about you, but I can’t believe I’m actually meeting you!
Bruce: Thanks?
Bruce: What are you doing in Tony’s lab?
Peter: I’m part of the Stark Internship. Mr. Stark asked me to meet him at his lab.
Bruce: Tony’s not here. He went out a while ago and I have no idea when he’ll be back.
Peter: Oh.
Bruce: *both of them stood there awkwardly for a minute*
Bruce: *Bruce realized that it was a ringtone*
Peter: Mr. Stark?
Peter: Where am I? I’m in your lab. You’re the one that isn’t here.
Tony: Um… I’m pretty sure I would know if I wasn’t in my own lab.
Peter: You have more than one lab?
Tony: Yes? Have you met me?
Peter: Well then where are you?
Tony: You’re in my tinkering lab. I’m on the 39th floor in my work lab. Take the elevator up and you can’t miss it.
Peter: Okay, Mr. Stark. I’ll be right up. *Peter ran out of the lab*
Bruce: Nice to meet you. Bye."
7,12634773,Bruce,Thor,"Bruce: Hmm, *he mused as he turned and went back to work.*
Thor: Greetings, young one, *Thor spoke.*
Peter: Uh, hi. *It was hard not to be intimidated by Thor. He was giant and loud and one of the coolest Avengers. So Peter was awed, yes, but also intimidated.*
Thor: Where are you headed this fine afternoon? *asked Thor pleasantly.*
Peter: The 39th floor. To Mr. Stark’s lab. *Peter answered. And you?*
Thor: I do not have a specific destination. I merely enjoy riding in this wondrous contraption. It is amazing, is it not?
Peter: Yeah, elevators are pretty cool. *Peter was as awkward as ever, but something about the Asgardian was likeable and made him feel slightly less out of place.The elevator dinged and it was his floor. Peter waved awkwardly and left.*
Thor: Have a marvelous day, young one! It was an honor to meet you! *Thor yelled after him as the doors closed.*
Natasha: You too, Bruce? *Steve said.*
Bruce: I, too, met the young one today. He was quite nice, *Thor told them.*
Natasha: Not the point, Thor. Anyway, I looked into his background to see who his parents were.
Bruce: Are you saying what I think you’re saying?
Natasha: I think Clint was right.
Clint: I was right?! *He landed in a painful heap on top of the counter before he groaned. I knew it!*
Steve: Do you think Peter is going to get Tony a gift for Father’s Day? *he asked.*
Clint: He hasn’t said anything about it, *Clint answered.*"
8,12634773,Clint,Peter,"Clint: So, how are things going with Tony? *walks over to lean on the back of the couch*
Peter: Um... *looks equal parts confused and awkward*
Clint: You know the 18th is coming up in a few days... *trails off to wait for a reaction*
Peter: What? *now Peter was really confused. He wracked his brain for why that date would be important but found nothing* Uh, yeah. The 18th, *he finally said, hoping Clint would clarify*
Clint: Are you planning on getting Tony anything?
Peter: I'm supposed to get Tony something?
Clint: Well, I guess you don't have to. But I'm sure he'd appreciate the gesture.
Peter: What would- uh- What do you think Mr. Stark would like? Any suggestions?
Clint: Pfft! Uh, I don't know. You know him better than I do.
Peter: I do? *Peter looked like a deer in the headlights. Was he supposed to know Tony better than he did? Oh god, what had he done wrong?*
Clint: *noticed the look and immediately tried to make the situation better* I'm sure anything you get him will be..."
9,12634773,Peter,Clint,"Peter: “Pfft! Uh, I don’t know. You know him better than I do.”
Clint: “I’m sure anything you get him will be fine. With something like this, it only matters that you got him something.”
Peter: “Wait, how old do you think I am?”
Clint: “Well, I should go. I have… errands to run. I’ll see you around, kid.”
Tony: “Hey kid, Whatcha got there?”
Peter: “Oh, um. This is for you.”
Tony: “I don’t like being handed things, but I guess I can make an exception.”
Tony: “Wow. This is… really something. This is great, kid. I can always use more coffee. I practically live off of the stuff. Did you draw this yourself?”
Peter: “Uh, no. Actually I had a friend draw it. I’m not very good at drawing.”
Peter: “MJ! MJ! MJ! I need you to do me a favor and not ask any questions!”
MJ: “Okay…”
Peter: “I need you to draw a picture of Iron Man flying away from the Earth.”
MJ: “Okay.”
Peter: “Thank you so much! I owe you one!”"
10,12634773,Peter,Iron Man,"Peter: I need you to draw a picture of Iron Man flying away from the Earth.
Peter: Thank you so much! I owe you one!

Tony: Tell them thanks for me. All of this coffee talk is making me thirsty. I think I’ll go make myself some right now. Uh, I’ll see you later, kid. Thanks for the present.
Tony: Why in the world would the kid think it’s my birthday?

Steve: Do you think he got him a present?
Tony: Why does the kid think it’s my birthday? Who gave him that dumb idea?

Natasha: You had one job, Clint. What did you do?
Clint: I did what you told me to! I suggested he get him a present, but also said he didn’t have to. I said nothing about it being his birthday!

Thor: Why do these mortals decide to keep the small animal if it causes so many problems?
Tony: Well you keep Loki, don’t you?
Thor: True. But I love Loki because he is my brother. This creature called a puppy seems to serve no valid purpose.

Steve: Tony, why is your phone on? It’s movie night. You know the rule: No cell phones.
Tony: I had it turned off for all calls except emergency ones.
Natasha: That is the ringtone you assigned to emergency calls?
Tony: Yes, now if you’ll excuse me."
11,12634773,Tony,Natasha,"Tony: I had it turned off for all calls except emergency ones.
Natasha: That is the ringtone you assigned to emergency calls?
Tony: Yes, now if you’ll excuse me.
Tony: Yello?
Karen: Hello, Mr. Stark.
Tony: J.E.N.N.Y?
Karen: It’s Karen now.
Tony: Karen? Out of all of the names the kid could’ve picked, he chose Karen? Okay, not the point right now. Why did you call me?
Karen: Peter is currently unable to do so himself.
Tony: Why?
Karen: I recommended that Peter call 911, but he refused. I suggested calling you as a suitable alternative, however he is unable to do so. Therefore I am calling you instead.
Tony: Lots of questions right now, but I’ll stick with asking one. Why would Peter need to call 911 exactly?
Karen: Because he is currently unconscious and bleeding from several stab wounds.
Tony: How bad is it? Send me his location. I’m on my way.
Clint: Whoa, Tony. What’s wrong?
Tony: Yes, send them to me. I have to go.
Clint: Oh no, you don’t. If this is about Peter, we’re coming too.
Thor: I agree, Man of Iron. You are like a brother to me. Anything that concerns my dear nephew concerns me.
Tony: Nephew? What are you talking about? What nephew?!
Thor: Peter. Your son. On Asgard we often consider the children of our closest friends to be like nieces and nephews. Is this not the case on Midgard?
Tony: My s- What?! Peter isn’t my son! Look, I can’t do this right now. I have to go.
Clint: What? He’s not your son?
Natasha: Then why is he always at the tower?
Clint: Yeah, man. That’s actually really creepy if he’s not your kid.
Tony: Okay, this is a conversation we can have when I get back. Right now, I kind of have bigger things to worry about.
Clint: Like what?
Tony: Like the fact that Peter is unconscious and currently bleeding to death. Pretty sure that trumps any sort of conversation you want to have right now!
Steve: He’s right. We can figure this all out later. Everyone, suit up.
Tony: Wait, what? No. No. I don’t need nor do I want you to go with. I got this."
12,12634773,Tony,Steve,"Tony: He’s right. We can figure this all out later. Everyone, suit up.
Steve: Wait, what? No. No. I don’t need nor do I want you to go with. I got this.
Clint: Are you kidding? Even if he’s not your kid- which I still don’t totally believe, by the way- we’ve all grown to like the little twerp. We’re helping.
Steve: It’s decided. We’re going.
Karen: Mr. Stark, I thought it would be wise to inform you that Peter’s blood pressure and heart rate have dropped to dangerously low levels over the course of this conversation. I would suggest you hurry.
Thor: Let us make haste to save our nephew who has fallen in combat!
Natasha: I doubt it was much of a fight. He probably just got mugged or something.
Tony: Can I just say how much I hate all of you in this current moment?

Peter: You’re awake.
Tony: You okay, kid?
Peter: Y’h ‘m f’n.
Tony: I’m going to take that as a no. You know you almost died, right? Had everyone really worried for a while there.
Peter: ‘v’ryone?
Tony: They saw the medics strip you out of the suit, kid. I think they’re smart enough to put the pieces together.
Thor: Fear not, nephew, your secret is safe with us.
Natasha: You do remember we established that he isn’t actually related to Tony, right?
Clint: Probably.
Thor: Yes, though I do not see what that has to do with me calling Peter my nephew. He is as much my nephew as Loki is my brother, though we may not be related by blood.
Tony: Most of them are under the impression you’re my son, even though I’ve told them repeatedly that you’"
13,12634773,Tony,Clint,"Tony: Most of them are under the impression you’re my son, even though I’ve told them repeatedly that you’re not.
Clint: You can deny it all you want. Doesn’t make it any less true.
Steve: Don’t talk with food in your mouth.
Natasha: And stop eating my fries!
Clint: You know I eat when I’m stressed!
Peter: Wh’re’s May?
Tony: At home, completely unaware of what’s happened to you. As far as she knows, you’re on an out of state field trip for the next two days. That gives us a day before the school contacts her about you being absent and a few more hours before she calls me to get some real answers. Unless you’d like me to call her now, tell her the truth, and have a car bring her here to yell at you. Because we both know that’s what would happen if I called her right now.
Peter: No th’nks.
Bruce: Seriously? That’s the best excuse you could come up with?
Tony: It was three in the morning before I even remembered to cover for the kid with his aunt. It was the best I could scrap together in an hour at that time of night without breaking several federal and state laws.
Tony: Get some rest kid.
Peter: Th’nks dad.
Clint: Ha! I was right!
Tony: I don’t know what you’re talking about. He said ‘dud’. Not ‘dad’. That proves nothing. If anything, it proves the doctors have put him on a drug dosage that’s too high for him.
Tony: See what you’ve started?"
