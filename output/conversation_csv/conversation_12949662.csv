0,12949662,Tony,Peter,"Tony: Kid, you've got potential. But you need to focus, okay? You can't be a friendly neighborhood Spider-Man if there's no neighborhood left. *Tony gives Peter a stern look*

Peter: I'm trying, Mr. Stark. I really am. *Peter looks down, feeling a bit defeated*

Tony: I know you are, kid. Just keep your head in the game. We're counting on you. *Tony pats Peter on the shoulder reassuringly*

Peter: Thanks, Mr. Stark. I won't let you down. *Peter smiles gratefully at Tony*

Tony: Good. Because we're a team, kid. And I don't let my team down. *Tony gives Peter a small smile*

Peter: I won't let you down, Mr. Stark. I promise. *Peter stands up straight, determined to prove himself*

Tony: That's what I like to hear, Spider-Man. *Tony nods approvingly at Peter*

Peter: I'll do my best, Mr. Stark. I won't let you down. *Peter clenches his fists, ready to face any challenge*

Tony: I know you won't, kid. Just remember, with great power comes great responsibility. *Tony looks at Peter with a serious expression*

Peter: I won't forget, Mr. Stark. I'll do whatever it takes to protect the people I care about. *Peter looks determined*

Tony: That's the spirit, Spider-Man. Now go out there and show the world what you're made of. *Tony gives Peter a supportive pat on the back*

Peter: I will, Mr. Stark. I won't let you down. *Peter puts on his mask and swings away, ready to face whatever comes his way*"
1,12949662,Ned,Peter,"Ned: Dude, dude, dude, *tripped into the classroom Peter was currently dozing in.*
Peter: Mmmph... *groaned eloquently.*
Ned: This is like the coolest thing ever! *waving his phone enthusiastically.*
Peter: *squinted at him.*
Ned: Haven’t you seen the news this morning?
Peter: No, what’s happened?
Ned: *thrust his phone under Peter’s nose.*
Peter: *blinked at it for a moment before realizing why this particular picture was apparently worth media attention.*
Ned: Did you know he had that? Did you give it to him?
Peter: No, Ned, I didn’t give him some of my own merchandise. I wouldn’t even know where to get any.
Ned: *looked like he was about to start fanboying even more over the idea that Tony Stark had apparently bought himself a Spider-Man t-shirt.*
Peter: *put his head back down on the desk and feigned sleep.*

May: Oh, you were so brave, *praised as she led him to the couch.*
Peter: *settled down into the cushions with a sigh and closed his eyes.*
May: *went to get ice for his slightly swollen knee, only half listening to the news anchors chat.*
News anchor: …. no casualties reported so far, and the DODC is on the scene. In fact, most people are more interested in a video capturing the moments immediately following the battle, featuring Tony Stark’s Iron Man and the vigilante known as Spider-Man—
Peter: *eyes snapped open.*
News anchor: Let’s take a look at the video, Selene."
2,12949662,Peter,Selene,"Peter: Let’s take a look at the video, Selene.
News anchors: It’s nice to see a little bit of brotherly love between teammates, isn’t it, Robert?
Robert: Especially after the fallout of the Sokovian Accords only fourteen months ago.
May: You haven’t seen the picture, have you?
May: You can always talk to me, you know that, right?
Peter: ’Course. ‘Course I do. Why would you ask that?
May: You haven’t seen the picture, have you?
May: You can always talk to me, you know that, right?
Peter: ’Course. ‘Course I do. Why would you ask that?
Tony: Look, kid, I really don’t want to be the bad cop here, but you promised your aunt you’d put school first. What are you doing?
Peter: Bad day.
Tony: Like, failed a history test bad? Got shoved in a locker bad? I have no idea what high schoolers consider to be bad days.
Peter: My uncle died a year ago today bad."
3,12949662,Tony,Peter,"Tony: What are you doing?
Peter: Bad day.
Tony: Like, failed a history test bad? Got shoved in a locker bad? I have no idea what high schoolers consider to be bad days.
Peter: My uncle died a year ago today bad.
Tony: I'm sorry, Peter. I forgot it was today.
Peter: Yeah, well... *shrugged, kicking his feet against the brick*
Tony: *placed a heavy hand on Peter's shoulder in silent sympathy*
May: I'm glad that you feel like you can talk to him about... this. But I want to make sure you know you can talk to me, too.
Peter: I know, May.
Peter: *playing on his phone with one hand while holding onto a bar with the other*
Peter: *clicked on the link* TONY STARK: 'IF EVERYONE WERE MORE LIKE SPIDER-MAN, I COULD RETIRE'
Tony: No. Absolutely not. I've had the honor of working with Spider-Man, and I can guarantee that he's a good, solid guy. There aren't many people in this world who genuinely care about everyone they meet, but Spider-Man does. He will do anything to help anyone. Honestly, if everyone were more like Spider-Man, I could retire.
Peter: *blinked at his phone screen* He thought that highly of me?
Peter: *woke up in the med-bay*
May: *at his bedside*
Tony: *lurking in the corner, pretending to be very invested in whatever was on his phone*
Peter: What happened?
Steve: It's like..."
4,12949662,Peter,Steve,"Peter: Captain, what happened? *demanding*
Steve: It's like we said, Pete. *assuring*
Peter: I have a right to know.
Steve: FRIDAY, pull up the news report following the battle.
News anchor: We are receiving new footage right now from the scene of the fight...
Peter: *watching the footage in shock*
Tony: No! *screaming*
Peter: *seeing Tony's lips forming his name over and over*
Tony: *pressing his hands against Peter's chest*
Tony: *looking up and shouting for help*
Captain America: *jogging onto the screen*
Steve: *wrapping bandages around Peter's chest*
Tony: *fumbling for Peter's mask*
Tony: *breathing for Peter*
Peter: *gasping for air*
Tony: *relieved and placing his hand on Peter's forehead*"
5,12949662,Peter,Tony,"Peter: I want to talk to you. *his chest heaving as he sucked in lung-fulls of air.*
Tony: *went visibly limp with relief, using one hand to support himself, placing the other on Peter’s forehead.* Yes!
Camera-man: Yes!
Captain America: You really shouldn’t be here. It’s not safe.
Steve: Are you ok, Peter?
Peter: Yeah, I… yeah. I stopped breathing?
Steve: For a few minutes, yeah. Your heart never stopped, though.
Peter: Oh, well, that’s good, that’s something to celebrate. Good ol’ heart.
FRIDAY: Would you like me to alert Boss that you’re asking for him?
Peter: Uh, ye-yeah. Thanks, FRIDAY.
Tony: Hey, kid. FRI said you wanted me. What’s up?
Peter: I saw the news. The video. Of the-of the battle.
Tony: Steve show you?
Peter: Only cause I asked.
Tony: ’Course he did.
Peter: Thank you.
Tony: Don’t mention it, Pete. I’d rather not remember that, to be honest.
Peter: Oh, right. Still. I owe you.
Tony: Never do that again and I’ll consider us even.
Peter: Deal."
6,12949662,Peter,Tony,"Peter: Deal. *Peter smiled and earned an honest smile in return.*
Tony: *Tony stayed until Peter was done with his breakfast.*

Peter: *Peter didn’t spend a ton of time at the Avengers compound...* But on occasion, Saturdays would find him upstate; training, working with Tony in the lab, or just spending time with his mentor and assorted heroes.
Tony: *Tony waved the thought away and told Peter that it’d be a learning experience for him, and that he could stand with Pepper in the back.*

Peter: *It was fairly interesting, seeing the way Tony handled the reporters...* so he tried to take note of what Tony did so he could remember it for later.
Tony: *The conference was winding down...* But in terms of my hero, my perspective has been changed a bit in the last year or so. People I thought were heroes turned out to be less worthy of my admiration than I thought, and people I never would have considered could do great things have opened my eyes to the good in the world. I know someone who lives their life everyday by the philosophy that when you have the ability to help, you have the responsibility to help.

Peter: *Peter looked up, his stomach knotting in uncomprehending anticipation for Tony’s next words.* And because of that, I can honestly say that the person I look up to for inspiration, my hero—
Tony: *Tony’s eyes flicked up and met Peter’s across the room,* is Spider-Man.

Peter: *The room erupted into more questions, but Peter wasn’t listening to any of them...* He was staring blankly up at the podium where Tony stood, still looking at him.
Tony: *Finally, the door opened again and Tony stepped through, looking relieved to be done.* A 50 minute conference about Stark Industries’ clean energy initiative in third world countries, and you know all the newspapers are going to have headlines about Spider-Man tomorrow, Tony sighed, sounding annoyed, but casting an almost pleased smile at Pepper as she kissed his cheek and excused herself.

Peter: *Peter suddenly didn’t know what to do around Tony...* Peter opened his mouth, thought for a second and then shut it again. Tony snorted. He was about to speak when Peter interrupted.
Tony: Come on, kid, Tony said. Say something.
Peter: You’re my hero, too, he finally managed to choke out. Always have been.
Tony: *Tony beamed at him, the widest smile Peter had ever seen him give.* He strode across the room and slung an arm over Peter’s shoulder and began guiding him to the kitchen."
7,12949662,Peter,Tony,"Peter: You’re my hero, too. Always have been.
Tony: Of course I am. I’m awesome. *beams at Peter*
Tony: Let me guide you to the kitchen. *slings an arm over Peter's shoulder and begins guiding him*
Tony: Hope you liked it! Let me know!"
