0,13064187,Draco,Hermione,"Draco: The fire's gone out.
Draco: I thought things were going rather well between us. Or is that not what you meant?
Hermione: *snorted* That fire is still doing particularly well, thank you. I refer to the actual fire. The one that has flames and coals and ash.
Draco: Oh, that fire.
Draco: Yes, that fire. Be a good man and relight it for me, would you?
Draco: *growled* I think I would prefer to stay in this nice warm bed with a very nice warm wife.
Draco: *smiled down at her* Besides, I seem to recall there was a reason we decided not to put the all-night charms on the fire when we went to bed. What was--
Scorpius: Mummy! Papa! He came!
Draco: *said dryly* Ah, there's the reason.
Hermione: *stifled a giggle* Good morning, Scorpius.
Draco: *whispered to Hermione* Later.
Scorpius: He came, after all this time!
Draco: *said dryly* Who came? Your grandfather?
Scorpius: No-o-o-o. Nicholas!
Hermione: *asked quietly* Who is Nicholas?
Scorpius: Father Nicholas! May I get Aurora, please? She needs to see this!
Draco: *said with a soft sigh* You may wake her. But remember not to--
Hermione: *asked again* Who is Nicholas?
Draco: One of my mother's fancies. Something her family used to do. Apparently some mythological wizard crawls through the windows on Christmas Eve, puts up greenery, and leaves gift and sweets behind. Obviously, the adults in the household do all the work, but the children don't learn that until much later. My father never approved of the tradition, so my mother never had a chance to put it into practice for me. She thought her opportunity had come with Scorpius.
Draco: *sighed* But she was disappointed there, as well. Astoria didn't much care for the idea either. She said she didn't want strange men wandering the house at night. Of course, we all know that for a blatant lie. What she didn't want was men who weren't there for her.
Hermione: *ignored the bitterness in Draco's voice* No matter what Astoria had done, Draco had loved her once, and Hermione knew he had the right to more than bitterness. He had pain very few people had ever seen."

Draco: *fiddles with the iron pokers at the fireplace*
Hermione: *rises from the bed and crosses the room to wrap both arms around Draco* She laid her head on his chest over his heart and embraced him tightly. She didn't speak; she only held him.
Draco: *shifts, presses a kiss into her hair, takes a deep breath, and straightens up* Right. Rather enough of that. Shall we dress, fetch our children, and see what on earth Scorpius is babbling about?
Hermione: *smiles up at him* Our children. I never get tired of hearing those words.

Draco: *hard-pressed not to swear in front of the children* All right, son. What do we have under the tree?
Scorpius: *cheers and leans over the packages* This is for Aurora. She should open hers first because she's the youngest.
Hermione: Very good, Scorpius. Why don't you help her with it?"
2,13064187,Hermione,Scorpius,"Hermione: Oh, angel, *wraps him in a hug* There is no need to fret. If you want to learn to fly on a broomstick, that's perfectly all right. If you don't, that's fine. If you never step into a Floo, that's also fine! No matter what you choose, we'll support you with it and help you with it. What do we always tell you, your father and I? We'll be proud of you, however you excel.
Aurora: *wriggles her arms between them and hugs Scorpius tight* Bih budder, *she said* Budder essell.
Scorpius: *gives a small, choking laugh and wipes his eyes on his sleeve* Big brother excels, *he said to Aurora* I can't do otherwise with you around, can I? Have to be a good example.
Hermione: *smiles up at him, her dark eyes shining with admiration* Thank god I have you, *he muttered* I didn't have the slightest inkling of what to say to him, other than 'fly only if you want'. That hardly seems adequate.
Draco: More than adequate, actually. He's progressed so far since I first met him, but he still needs to know that you approve of him and his choices. Especially when it comes to wizarding society. He's a remarkably sensitive boy, wildly intelligent, and he knows that he's at a disadvantage when magic is involved. *he watched the children playing, her fingers idly toying with the tips of Draco's long blond hair* So long as he knows that you are proud of him and that you are there for him, he'll continue to make great strides.
Hermione: That's all I ever wanted for him, *he said quietly* That he excels at whatever he does. Even â€¦ even when I thought he would be relegated to the Muggle world, with nothing I could do for him, with no possible way for me to know how to help him, I wanted him to be at his best.
Draco: *gives a soft sigh* *he pulled her tight to him and tilted his head, capturing her mouth for a long kiss*"
3,13064187,Draco,Narcissa,"Draco: Mum, We appreciate all the gifts, don't think for a moment that we don't, but it wasn't necessary for you to sneak them into the house. You could have brought them over this morning and the children would have loved it all just as much.
Narcissa: To what are you referring, Draco?
Hermione: All the gifts, How did you get them all into the house in the first place? I would have thought that the servants would have insisted on Draco knowing beforehand.
Narcissa: Hermione, my dear, I haven't the faintest idea of what you mean. What gifts?
Lucius: Presents, For the children, Father Nicholas.
Narcissa: Father Nicholas, I do remember. But, my darling, I had never thought-- That is to say, you were always against--
Lucius: Don't know why, Can't remember that. But seemed like an excellent idea now. Happy family. Nothing more important than my family. Hearing children laugh.... It's better than any potion. Makes me feel whole again.
Narcissa: However did you manage to talk their servants into letting you deliver the gifts?
Lucius: Didn't. Did it m'self. Still got a few tricks up my wizardly sleeves.
Draco: I am not going to ask. I'm rather certain I don't truly want to know.
Hermione: Best to take the gifts as they are given, No matter how they arrive.
Scorpius: Father Nicholas will bring a big gift next year, For me, and for Aurora, and for our sister."
4,13064187,Scorpius,Aurora,"Scorpius: Father Nicholas will bring a big gift next year. For me, and for Aurora, and for our sister.
Hermione: Scorpius? What on earth--
Scorpius: Sister. She'll be here. Gift for everyone.
Narcissa: Hermione, are you--
Hermione: No. At least, not yet. But he's never wrong. Our little Seer is never wrong. Therefore I must assume I will be. Soon enough.
Draco: Exactly how I feel. Don't suppose 'Father Nicholas' would have a few tricks up his sleeves that involve expanding nurseries?
Lucius: Do you know, I do believe he might."
