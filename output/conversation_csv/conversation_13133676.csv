0,13133676,Peter,James,"Peter: James swooped overhead, his red robes billowing, his broom straight as an arrow – like a quidditch poster.
Peter: It gave Peter the usual jolt of excitement, combined with a sickly twist of envy.
Peter: He’d tried almost every year – except the year Sirius went for beater, it was best to stay well out of that, he could do without the teasing.
Peter: Only two days ‘til the Christmas holidays.
Peter: Part of him couldn’t wait - no lessons for two whole weeks. Presents. Turkey. Mrs Potter’s mince pies.
Peter: But then, he wasn’t even sure if they were going home yet; the full moon fell on Christmas night, and for some reason no one wanted to discuss it.
Peter: Remus never talked about full moons, ever, which seemed strange to Peter, but Remus was always strange.
Peter: James was usually the most practical one, but lately all his time was taken up with Lily, so he wasn’t going to tell them what to do.
Peter: Sirius was Sirius, and you could never talk to him about anything to do with Moony, unless you wanted your head bitten off.
Peter: Maybe that was just Peter’s problem, though; he was always saying the wrong thing.
Peter: James had possession of the quaffle now, blew his whistle and tossed it to another chaser; Emelia Eriksson.
Peter: She caught it, and aimed for the goal posts, but missed.
Peter: Peter clicked his tongue, agitated. She was always missing.
Peter: Last game, she’d dropped the bloody thing - saved by James, who had swooped beneath her and caught it deftly before Ravenclaw could take possession.
Peter: If Peter had his way, she’d be off the team.
Peter: James was convinced Emilia would improve, and wouldn’t listen to Peter’s advice.
Peter: Which was fair enough. Not as if Peter could do any better himself.
Peter: The problem was, the only position Peter had ever been any good in was keeper.
Peter: He’d played that role almost exclusively throughout their childhood, when it had just been him and James every afternoon.
Peter: He missed those days bitterly; having James all to himself.
Peter: Peter had worshipped James ever since he could remember.
Peter: But the time you put in doesn’t count for much – he knew that.
Peter: Like the keeper position. Peter had been good, but not good enough.
Peter: James had been very kind about it, but James was always kind.
Peter: Not good enough. A common criticism, and, again; fair, Peter supposed.
Peter: He’d heard it from his mother from an early age – and his father, (who had left shortly after Peter was six, and had only occasionally made guest appearances in his son’s life since.)
Peter: He was either not quiet enough, or too quiet; too slow or too clumsy.
Peter: Didn’t do enough reading. Didn’t get enough practice.
Peter: Peter’s greatest shame was that he had shown no signs of magic at all until he was almost eleven, while James (‘the Potters’ boy’, as he was known in the Pettigrew household) had been able to levitate various household items from the age of two.
Peter: At Hogwarts things had been much the same – Peter rarely shone in his lessons, except for Astronomy, which he had a good memory for.
Peter: Still, there was less pressure."
1,13133676,Peter,Dezzie,"Peter: Dezzie had seen it. *bit the inside of his cheek to distract himself*
Peter: He missed her every day. He thought maybe he had been in love with her. But it was impossible, in the end. Even if she hadn’t dumped him, she was a half-blood. Mother wouldn’t have it.
Peter: It had mattered less, when Dezzie was around. *wondered if those had been his glory years*
Peter: Anyway, Dezzie had convinced him in fourth year that he should just join if he liked chess so much. So he had.
Peter: Well, until that disaster in fifth year - and that hadn’t even been Peter’s fault, blame Sirius if you wanted to blame someone. Blame Moony.
Peter: Bloody Lily, she was worse than Sirius. James had all but disappeared, since they’d started going out.
Peter: What would it be like once they finished school? *thinking about his future plans*
Peter: He didn’t think he’d be too bad at clerical work. Some of his friends in the chess club mentioned they might be able to help him out, too."
2,13133676,Mary,Connor,"Mary: Hiya, Mary!
Connor: Hello, Connor.
Mary: You look gorgeous!
Connor: What are you up to, later?
Mary: Oh, I'm really busy today. Up until Christmas, actually."
3,13133676,Connor,Mary,"Connor: to, later?”
Mary: Oh, I’m really busy today. Up until Christmas, actually.
Connor: Maybe in the new year, then?
Mary: Erm… look, I don’t think so. Sorry, Connor.
Connor: Oh, go on, be nice, you went out with Eric Leith, he told us!
Mary: I don’t know what you’re talking about.
Connor: Yeah you do, he told us. You and him, round the back of the Hog’s Head, he says you let him put his—
Mary: Listen to me, you little creep! Eric Leith is a lying prick. I went for a drink with him twice, and he forgot to bring cash both times – and he still owes me for it. Did he tell you that?
Connor: *shook his head*
Mary: *advancing on him* I’m a fucking lioness, you little pervert. I wouldn’t let Eric Leith touch me with a ten-foot barge pole, let alone his grubby little hands. Only went with him because I felt sorry for him – he’s pathetic, and so are you, so get lost.
Connor: *retreating to the tower* Dirty little slag! As if I’d fancy you! Only tried ‘coz everyone say’s you’re easy.
Mary: *putting her wand away and walking down the stairs* Sticks and stones. Run along, little boy!
Connor: *spat from the top of the stairs* Mudblood!"
4,13133676,Lily,Severus,"Lily: That stupid cow isn't worth crying over!
Severus: You're worth ten of her!
Lily: Ugh, well, that settled it. James definitely couldn't come for Christmas.
Lily: She'd just have to explain it to James - fortunately, she knew he'd understand.
Lily: She wiped quickly under her eyes just to make sure, and glanced at her ghostly reflection in the window glass to check her face.
Lily: He would be in a good mood, right after practice, even if it had gone badly.
Lily: Lily rehearsed in her head exactly what she planned to say - best not to mention Petunia's letter, better to frame it as her own idea.
Lily: That was unfair, she scolded herself. At least James cared enough to ask - at least he was genuinely interested."
5,13133676,Lily,Mary,"Lily: Oi! *shouted* Why did boys have to be so rude?
Mary: Hi! *smiled* Must have just missed you leaving the tower. Meeting Marlene?
Lily: Yep.
Mary: How is Potter? Gone all the way, yet? Full Monty?
Lily: Oh my god, Mary...
Mary: What?! *giggled* I'm just curious. Never had James, myself. Not even a snog.
Lily: I'm glad. *rolled her eyes*
Mary: Two out of four isn't bad. Never fancied Peter, poor chap.
Lily: Mm, I'm still not sure I believe you about Remus...
Mary: Ask him. *shrugged, confidently* What are you two doing, after this? Cosying up in your usual spot on the nice couch?
Lily: I need to tell him he can't come home with me for Christmas, *bit her lip, frowning* Tuney won't have it - her boyfriend's spending the day, so I s'pose it's not really fair...
Mary: Ugh, bugger Petunia. *tutted*"
6,13133676,Lily,Tuney,"Lily: Tuney won't have it - her boyfriend's spending the day, so I s'pose it's not really fair...
Mary: Ugh, bugger Petunia. That thick-necked boyfriend of hers might be big, but he doesn't take up that much room. You should come over our flat on Christmas day - fifteen of us 'round the table, and that's a quiet dinner.
Lily: Yeah, but I don't want to upset her...
Mary: Anyway, you're completely bonkers over that boy. All's fair in love and war, innit?
Lily: Mm..."
7,13133676,Marlene,Yaz,"Marlene: Ought to be in Slytherin!
Yaz: Snooze you lose, Patel!
Marlene: Aah! Just how I like it!
Yaz: Saucy minx.
Marlene: *tilts her head back to soak her hair, and bites her lip*
Marlene: Hey, McKinnon, I've got a bruise, can you take a look? I've heard you're Pomfrey's star pupil...
Marlene: Um... ok, I can look, just a minute--"
8,13133676,Yaz,Marlene,"Yaz: I’ve got a bruise, can you take a look? I’ve heard you’re Pomfrey’s star pupil…” *smirking* Nice and warm in here.
Marlene: Where’s the um... The ...bruise? *watching the steam settle on Yaz’s warm brown shoulders and roll down in rivulets, soaking into the thin towel.*
Yaz: What are you doing after this? Fancy a walk?
Marlene: Er… my friend Mary’s outside…
Yaz: You see her all the time. Come for a walk with me.
Marlene: Um. Yes. Ok. *Now it was happening, she had no idea what to do at all.* The… bruise?
Yaz: Oh yeah, *laughing* Just here... *leans forward and kisses Marlene*
Marlene: *butterflies*

Sirius: He was going to tell James. Just as soon as he knew what to say. Fucking hell, how had it been so easy for Moony? *thinking about Remus* That was Remus all over. That was the draw. Just as soon as you thought you understood enough to see him clearly, another part revealed itself, and the whole picture transformed before your eyes. *thinking about James* James was the opposite; what you saw was what you got, and Sirius loved him fiercely for that."
9,13133676,Sirius,James,"Sirius: Yes, he definitely had to tell James.
Sirius: Where was Prongs? Quidditch.
Sirius: Anyway, if practice was over, that meant Evans would be there to meet James.
Sirius: Well, that really left him no choice, Sirius decided with a smirk to himself. Moony.
Sirius: Now, where was Moony…?
Sirius: Ah. No. There he was. Remus Lupin, the flag read, and Sirius had to laugh at himself. He was only down in the bloody common room. Just a few meters away."
10,13133676,Sirius,Remus,"Sirius: Oh merlin, what on earth had the stupid prat decided to square off against now?!
Remus: *slumped over in his favourite armchair, head resting on a bent elbow, huge book in his lap. Fast asleep, snoring very softly.*
Sirius: *stood apart from him, hands on hips, and smiled.*
Remus: *stirred awake, stretching and yawning and grinning dopily up at Lily, who patted him on the head, leaning against his chair.*
Lily: Sorry love, didn't want to wake you.
Remus: Didn't mean to fall asleep.
Remus: *looked up at Sirius and gave him a quick, secretive smile. Sirius looked away, shyly.*
James: I'm just dumping my kit, then going down for an early tea. You lot want to come?
Peter: D'you know what."
11,13133676,James,Peter,"James: I’m just dumping my kit. Then going down for an early tea. You lot want to come?
Peter: Think I’ll stay here and see if anyone fancies a game.
Mary: I’ll walk down with you, See if Roman’s about.
Lily: I thought you two had split up?
Mary: *shrugged, hand on her hip*
James: Alright, gimme five minutes, Evans. *strode off towards the dorm with his bag, whistling merrily.*
Remus: *yawned* Nah, sorry mate. Too much reading.
Sirius: *held up his crossword* Really into this, actually.
Remus: All right?
Sirius: Yeah."
