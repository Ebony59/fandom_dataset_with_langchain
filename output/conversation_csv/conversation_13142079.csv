0,13142079,Hazel Potter,Cedric Diggory,"Hazel Potter: So mote be it! *let out a brief yelp of pain and clutched at the area, absently noting Cedric doing the same*
Ron: Hazel! Hazel! Are you ok? What’s wrong? *white with worry as tears trailed down Hazel’s cheeks*
Professor McGonagall: Just what is going on here?! *the stern voice of Professor McGonagall echoed over the corridor*
Hufflepuff: Potter did something to Cedric! She ought to be chucked in Azkaban! *snarled before cowering at the intense glare from several Gryffindor’s and their Head of House*
Professor McGonagall: Since Miss Potter is only twelve, Mr Jones, I highly doubt that she has somehow done something to Mr Diggory that warrants expulsion, let alone Azkaban. Now, what happened?
Fred: Diggory swore an Unbreakable, denouncing Hazel and any chance of a relationship together. *said stonily as Professor McGonagall went pale*
Professor McGonagall: Show me your Words, Mr Diggory. If you’ve done what I think you have then you will come to regret that vow.
Cedric Diggory: *held out his arm and slowly peeled the sleeve on his left arm back, baring his Soulmark*
Professor McGonagall: Well, Mr Diggory. It seems Magic has taken your desire to reject your Soulmate quiet thoroughly. Your bond has been Severed.
Professor McGonagall: Miss Potter, May I? *approached the young lion*"
1,13142079,McGonagall,Hazel,"McGonagall: Miss Potter, may I? *approaches Hazel*
Hazel: *shakily nods and holds out her arm*
McGonagall: Careful, careful. Just sit down. That was quite the nasty fall you took there.
Hazel: *hiccupped in shock*
Cedric: How're you doing, Hazel? Nice to finally put a face to the name!
McGonagall: Well, Miss Potter, it seems Magic has deemed you worthy of a Second Chance.
Hazel: What?
McGonagall: Go back to the Common Room and I will be along as soon as I can to fully explain it to you, once I have Professor Dumbledore, Madam Pomfrey and Professor Sprout impress the consequences of what he has done to Mr Diggory.
McGonagall: While I would commend such transfiguration skill, Miss Brown, I doubt your rabbits would like the taste.
Hazel: *smiles weakly*
McGonagall: Miss Potter, why don't we have this talk in private? You can then decide who you want privy to the information later.
Hazel: *nods quietly*
McGonagall: Tea, Potter? You've had a very trying day.
Hazel: Yes, please Professor."
2,13142079,Professor McGonagall,Hazel,"Professor McGonagall: Tea, Potter? You've had a very trying day.
Hazel: Yes, please Professor. *quietly takes the offered teacup*
...
Professor McGonagall: I hope that you understand that what Mr Diggory did was wrong. Even if you were the Heir of Slytherin, he should never have taken that oath.
Hazel: You mean, you believe I'm not the Heir?
Professor McGonagall: Miss Potter... Hazel, even if you were the Heir, you would never do what has happened. You are far too kind and most certainly not someone who would have allowed two of your classmates, a ghost and a cat to be petrified.
...
Hazel: Thank you.
Professor McGonagall: Now, what do you know of Second Chance Soulmarks?
Hazel: I've never heard of it, Professor.
Professor McGonagall: Wouldn't surprise me. It is a very rare event. Even rarer than Severing.
...
Professor McGonagall: Second Chance Soulmarks appear when a magical person who has been unjustly denied their Soulmate whether by illness, death or by the actions of other people. His intention to have no relationship with you effected the vow and Magic decided to Sever the Bond.
Hazel: What you mean, Professor?
Professor McGonagall: It means that Mr Diggory will suffer the effects of a Severed Bond for the rest of his life. That is all you need to know, Miss Potter. As far as you are concerned, Mr Diggory is no longer your Soulmate. Instead, you have a new Soulmate.
...
Hazel: I thought Soulmates were permanent?
Professor McGonagall: They are to a certain degree. There is a common misconception that Soulmates mean that you are two halves of the same soul. This is incorrect. No one's soul is half of another's. A Soulmate is merely the person who you have the greatest potential with that you will meet in your lifetime. They will be the one who understands you the most, will stand by your side through adversity and peace, and will put you above all others. A Soulmark is merely the indication of who that greatest potential is with.
...
Professor McGonagall: Unlike a normal Soulmark, you will feel a tug leading you towards your Soulmate when you come of age unless you meet them beforehand. It will not force you towards them but it will encourage you to meet them. Therefore, you are guaranteed to meet them. From what I know, the mark will also change slightly when your Words have been spoken to let you know you have met your soulmate. How it changes depends on the person."
3,13142079,Remus,Hazel,"Remus: Hazel, I hope you don’t mind my asking but do you know why Gryffindor was so antagonistic towards Hufflepuff? As far as I can remember, the two houses always got along well.
Hazel: *nearly dropped a fork and started fiddling with the edge of her tea towel* Hazel?
Remus: *eyebrows furrowed, and he looked at her with wide eyes* What do you know about my second year?
Hazel: *chewed on her lip slightly then spoke quietly* Not much. Only that the Chamber of Secrets had been opened and some students had been attacked. None of the teachers would tell me anything more although Professor McGonagall always looked very angry whenever I tried to ask so I left it. I didn’t want to ask any of the students."
4,13142079,Hazel,Remus,"Hazel: Not much. Only that the Chamber of Secrets had been opened and some students had been attacked. None of the teachers would tell me anything more although Professor McGonagall always looked very angry whenever I tried to ask so I left it. I didn’t want to ask any of the students either.
Remus: *sits on the old sofa and watches as Hazel plunks into the seat, pulling her knees up to her chest*

Hazel: I’m a parselmouth.
Remus: *Amber eyes went wide with shock and he hummed.* Odd. Neither of your parents could do that and it’s typically passed down through the family.

Hazel: *tenses as she waits for Remus to respond*
Remus: Of course not, Hazel. It’s how we use our abilities, not what abilities we have that make us who we are. *stretches an arm around Hazel’s shoulders and tugs her gently into a hug*

Hazel: There was a duelling club and Snape paired me with Malfoy to do a demonstration. Malfoy set a snake on me. I didn’t know I could speak Parseltongue! It sounds like English to me! Everyone found out and they all thought I was the Heir of Slytherin.
Remus: *rubs a hand down her back* Sounds like a load of bogus to me. You would never have attacked anyone. Why didn’t the teachers do anything?

Hazel: I don’t know but you know Cedric Diggory?
Remus: *frowns* Yes? Hufflepuff, isn’t he?

Hazel: He was my Soulmate.
Remus: *arms around her tighten suddenly and a rough growl ripples out of Remus’ chest* What did he do?

Hazel: He took an Unbreakable Vow to never have any kind of future with me.
Remus: *curls around Hazel and mutters words of love and support into her hair as she slowly cries herself out*

Hazel: *takes the handkerchief that Remus offered. She wipes away the remaining tears and blows her nose*
Remus: *brushes a few stray hairs from her face*

Hazel: After he took the Vow, my Words changed. Apparently, Magic judged the Vow to be unfair to me, so I got a Second Chance and my bond to Diggory was Severed. It was all over the school by the end of the day. Fred and George told Gryffindor House that anyone who gave me any more crap would answer to them. There were a few people in Gryffindor who thought I was the Heir, but they also thought I would never hurt anyone. So, Gryffindor kinda pulled together and started protecting me. Even the first years would try to look out for me. Everyone else still thought I was the Heir and it wasn’t until Hermione got attacked that it changed. I don’t think anyone in Gryffindor has forgiven Hufflepuff for protecting Diggory when it was obvious that I was the one who had been wronged.
Remus: *stunned* He’d briefly heard of Second Chances, but he’d never thought it would happen to someone he knew. He pulls Hazel back into a hug."
5,13142079,Hazel,Diggory,"Hazel: I don’t think anyone in Gryffindor has forgiven Hufflepuff for protecting Diggory when it was obvious that I was the one who had been wronged.
Remus: I’m sorry that happened to you, Hazel. While I’m happy that your house supported you, the rest of the school should never have turned on you like that. Especially him.
Hazel: Professor McGonagall said the gold means my new Soulmate won’t abandon me. That they might be an even better fit for me.
Remus: Whoever your Soulmate is, is a very lucky person and had better know what a brilliant young woman you are.

Hazel: I CAN’T BE-LIEVE YOU DIDN’T TELL US!!
Fred: All this time, we never knew we’d been taught by a Marauder!
George: WE ARE NOT WORTHY!
Hazel: The look on Remus’ face had been hysterical when Hazel had slipped up and called him Moony, only to be almost pounced on by the twins when Hazel explained who he was.

Mrs Weasley: Hello dear. How are you?
Hazel: I’m doing fine, Mrs Weasley.
Mrs Weasley: Why don’t you go put your things in the spare room by Ron’s? We’re eating outside this evening since my eldest, Bill and Charlie – I’m sure Ron’s mentioned them – are home for the Cup.
Hazel: I'm doing fine, Mrs Weasley.
Fred: No need for that, Miss Prongslet. Allow us!
Mr Weasley: Ah, Hazel. I see you got through ok. Where’s your trunk?
Hazel: Fred and George offered to take it upstairs for me.
Mr Weasley: *snorts*"
6,13142079,Hazel,Fred and George,"Hazel: Fred and George offered to take it upstairs for me, *said with a wry smile*.
Mr Weasley: *let out a snort*.
Bill: Hello, you must be Hazel, *said charmingly as he shook Hazel's hand*.
Charlie: How're you doing, Hazel? Nice to finally put a face to the name! *shook her hand firmly*.
Hazel: I...I... *tore her grip out of Charlie's and sprinted up the stairs*.
Ron: Hazel! *called after her, worried*.
Charlie: *gobsmacked*.
Percy: Hazel? *blinked down at the shorter girl*.
Percy: Right. Come on. That's it. Have a seat, *hustled Hazel into his room, shut the door and sat her on his bed*.
Hazel: *burst into shuddering weak tears*.
Hazel: Charlie...your brother...he...he... *took a breath*.
Percy: *rubbing an awkward hand up and down her back*.
Ron: Is Hazel in there?! *snapped out*.
Percy: Ron, Hermione. In. You three, make sure no one else disturbs us, *ordered and let the former two slip into the room*.
George: But what the hell is going on?! *demanded*.
Hazel: *almost hyper*."
7,13142079,Ron,Hazel,"Ron: Hazel in there?! *snapped out*
Percy: Ron, Hermione. In. You three, make sure no one else disturbs us.
George: But what the hell is going on?!
Percy: Charlie said her new words.
Fred: Leave him to us. We'll make sure he doesn't come up.
Ginny: *almost blank look on her face, tinged with guilt*
Percy: Ginny. Go downstairs and keep Mum and Dad away.
Hazel: I'm sorry. For running. I don't usually run from things that scare me.
Charlie: This scares you?
Hazel: Terrifies me. I wasn't expecting it to happen so soon.
Charlie: I'll be honest. I have no idea how this is going to develop between us. I love my dragons and I'm still under contract in Romania and you're still in school, but I'm willing to give this a try.
Hazel: I'm a parselmouth. My life is a media circus and everyone seems to turn on me at the drop of a hat. That's what you would be getting yourself into.
Charlie: Well, first off that's way cooler than Romanian. And secondly, I think I can handle a few idiots who think they have the right to know everything about you. So, you in?"
