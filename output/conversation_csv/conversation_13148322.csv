0,13148322,Tony Stark,Logan,"Tony Stark: Hey Logan, have you seen Steve around? I need to talk to him about the Accords.
Logan: *grunts* Yeah, I saw him earlier. He's probably in the training room.
Tony Stark: Thanks, Logan. I'll go find him there.
...

Tony Stark: Steve, we need to discuss the Accords. I think it's important for us to support them.
Steve Rogers: *crosses his arms* Tony, you know I can't agree with that. The Accords limit our freedom.
Tony Stark: I understand your concerns, Steve, but we need to think about the bigger picture. The Accords can help prevent unnecessary casualties.
...

Tony Stark: Logan, what do you think about the Accords?
Logan: *takes a sip of his drink* I don't give a damn about the Accords. I've always done things my own way.
Tony Stark: I get that, Logan, but we need to consider the consequences of our actions. The Accords can provide some structure and accountability.
...

Tony Stark: Hey Peter, have you heard about the Accords?
Peter Parker: *excitedly* Yeah, Mr. Stark! I've been reading about them. It's such a big deal!
Tony Stark: That's right, kid. It's important for us to understand the implications and make informed decisions.
...

Tony Stark: Charles, I wanted to get your opinion on the Accords. As a mutant, how do you feel about them?
Charles Xavier: *pauses* Tony, I believe the Accords can be a step towards unity and cooperation between mutants and humans. It's an opportunity for us to show that we can work together.
Tony Stark: I'm glad to hear that, Charles. We need all the support we can get.
...

Tony Stark: Natasha, what are your thoughts on the Accords?
Natasha Romanov: *leans back in her chair* I see both sides, Tony. The Accords can provide some much-needed regulation, but they also have the potential to be misused.
Tony Stark: I agree, Natasha. We need to find a balance and ensure that the Accords are implemented responsibly.
...

Tony Stark: Scott, I wanted to talk to you about the Accords. What do you think?
Scott Lang: *shrugs* I don't really care about politics, Tony. As long as I can keep being Ant-Man, I'm good.
Tony Stark: Fair enough, Scott. Just remember that our actions have consequences, and the Accords can help us navigate those consequences.
...

Tony Stark: Wanda, I know the Accords have been tough on you. But we need to find a way to move forward.
Wanda Maximoff: *nods* I understand, Tony. It's been a difficult adjustment, but I'm willing to work within the system.
Tony Stark: Thank you, Wanda. Your willingness to cooperate means a lot.
...

Tony Stark: Rhodey, I need your support on the Accords. We can make a difference together.
Tony Stark: I respect your decision, Rhodey. Just know that I'm doing what I believe is best for all of us.
...

Tony Stark: Vision, as an artificial intelligence, what are your thoughts on the Accords?
Vision: *pauses* Tony, I believe the Accords can provide a framework for cooperation and accountability. It's a logical step towards a safer world.
Tony Stark: I'm glad you see it that way, Vision. Your perspective is invaluable."

...

Iron Man: Hey, Thor. Fancy a friendly competition?
Thor: I'm always up for a challenge, Tony. Let's see who's the mightiest Avenger.
Iron Man: Bring it on, Thunder God. Prepare to be defeated.
...

Iron Man: Hey, Peter Quill. I hear you're quite the pilot.

...

Iron Man: Hey, Gamora. I've heard about your skills as an assassin.

Iron Man: I know you're a valuable asset to the team, Gamora. Let's show them what we're made of.
...

...

Iron Man: Hey, Sam. Ready to take flight with the new wings?
Falcon: Absolutely, Tony. These upgrades are amazing.
Iron Man: Glad you like them, Sam. Let's soar through the skies together.
...

Iron Man: Hey, Bucky. I know we've had our differences, but I believe in second chances.
Winter Soldier: I appreciate that, Tony. I'm ready to make amends.
Iron Man: Welcome to Team Stark, Bucky. Let's make the world a better place.
..."
2,13148322,Stark,Cap,"Stark: Tony, it wasn't him!
Cap: I didn't know it was him.
Stark: Don't bullshit me, Rogers! Did you know?
Cap: Yes.
Stark: *staggered back a step* Betrayal.
Stark: *jammed his eyes shut for a moment, and then he snapped* You know I wouldn't do this if I had another choice.
Cap: I could do this all day.

Logan: There was a point in the end when Logan had enough. He'd never liked Rogers. He was a stupid boy trying to play hero in the middle of a war. Now, he was about to take the head off of the son of the man who had given him all his toys. He was about to kill a grieving man who he had lied to for years. Logan didn't know about Stark - had always kind of pitied him to be honest - but one thing did cross his mind here."
3,13148322,Logan,Rogers,"Logan: I might be hurt at that if I gave a shit about you.
Rogers: Who are you?
Logan: You finished?
Rogers: Sir, there’s a lot happening here you don’t understand.
Logan: You don’t realise what’s going on. You’re fighting on the wrong side.
Rogers: You talk too much.

Logan: Lucky James."
4,13148322,Tony,Logan,"Tony: How long have you been here?
Logan: What year is it?
Tony: 2016.
Logan: About 20 years.
Tony: So why did Barnes call you 'Lucky James'?
Logan: I first met Cap and his babysitter back in the War. Back then, I was going by James Howlett. They didn’t notice my healing factor and reckoned I just never got hit.
Tony: *watches as Logan turns his head* Someone else is here. I’ll be right back.
Tony: *thinks to himself* Was it possible for someone to be born with powers?

T'Challa: Who are you?
Logan: The Wolverine.
T'Challa: I am King T’Challa of Wakanda, also known as the Black Panther.
Logan: Oh, you’re a long way from home.
T'Challa: And who might you be?
Logan: The Wolverine.
T'Challa: *retracts his claws* I will ask you to stand aside.
Logan: Why?
T'Challa: I had believed Srgt. Barnes killed my father. I discovered it wasn’t true, but I had been hunting him all this time. I need to rectify the situation.
Logan: Isn’t that funny? Stark just found out that Barnes did kill his parents.
T'Challa: It may have been faked. The evidence incriminating Barnes for my father’s death was.
Logan: Barnes admitted he did it.
T'Challa: Surely, the fact that he was brainwashed must count for something.
Logan: Did it matter to you when you thought he killed your father?
T'Challa: Well...no. No, it hadn’t. I was rash, but I have the true culprit. I still owe Barnes a debt for my sins against him.
Logan: It was stupid suspecting him anyway. I’ve heard of the Winter Soldier. He moves like a ghost. No one catches him, and suddenly he gets caught on tape? I don’t think so. How exactly did you plan to repay this debt?
T'Challa: I intended to take him back to Wakanda and offer him sanctuary until his programming could be removed.
Logan: *reacts with surprise* How long ago did you come out of isolation?
T'Challa: A few months...
Logan: So you got no idea that offering a wanted killer sanctuary, mind fucked or not, would incite an international incident that would not end well for Wakanda."
5,13148322,T'Challa,Wolverine,"T'Challa: We are the most technologically advanced nation in the world.
Wolverine: And you are alone.
T'Challa: It doesn’t matter how good your guns and bombs are. The minute you tell the world you don’t give a rat’s ass about all Barnes’s actual victims because it turns out your old man wasn’t one, you make every nation in the world your enemy. For reference, that’s nearly 200 countries against your 1. Doesn’t matter how advanced you are, you’re not coming out on top of that pissing contest.
Wolverine: Tell the world...? 70 years. The Winter Soldier has been killing for 70 years, and he has remained unseen. All those people, including the Starks, deserve to have justice delivered. Only Barnes can offer that. Maybe they find him not guilty or guilty under diminished capacity but he can tell them who was killed and who wanted those people dead. For the people he killed and disappeared cause he couldn’t fake an accident or whatever, he can tell where he stashed the bodies.
T'Challa: I presume you have advisors. If I were you, I’d turn the actual killer in, go home, and ask them how you can make amends to Barnes. Guy’s been dealt a bum hand, and Rogers doesn’t help. So what was the big idea anyway?
Wolverine: Let me get this straight. This guy blamed the Avengers for his family dying in the Sokovia Disaster last year, he decrypted millions of files to find two specific pieces of information, found Barnes’s old handler, got Barnes’s activation codes, drowned the handler, relied entirely on Rogers being against a document that demanded the enhanced be held responsible for their actions and Stark being for it, bombed the signing hoo-hah of said document and framed Barnes for it, relied on Cap going charging in to stop Barnes from being arrested, relied entirely on Stark pulling them in, killed and impersonated a head shrink for Barnes to turn him into the Winter Soldier, was actually left alone with a prisoner considered highly dangerous, knocked out the power in Stark’s facility and sent Barnes on a rampage, relied on Rogers not telling Stark about the other Winter Soldiers and relied on all the Avengers being called in – even the ones who shouldn’t fucking be there – and relied on everyone but Stark, Rogers, and Barnes being knocked out of the fight or arrested, which included relying on the Black Widow to betray Stark, relying on no one calling the Russians on him, and relying on all three following him to an abandoned HYDRA bunker in Siberia.
T'Challa: Then, to tie it all up, relying on Rogers to have not told Stark that the Winter Soldier killed his folks."
6,13148322,Logan,Vision,"Logan: I’m a mutant.
Vision: I’m afraid I don’t quite understand your meaning.
Logan: I have a particular mutation on my 23rd chromosome. It gave me these powers. For every mutant the powers are different. They generally manifest during an emotional outburst in puberty.
Vision: That’s why you want a copy of the Accords?
Logan: If they’ve finally gotten around to making laws for super-powered folks, I’d like to see what they are. Besides, I’m a Canadian that spends most of my time on American soil. I’d say they apply to me. I don’t like being ignorant. You end up looking like an idiot.
Vision: I’ll put in a request, Mr. Howlett.
Logan: Just call me Logan.

Rhodey: Most of the time, while Tony was building the braces, Logan had his nose in the Accords. He had a red pen and would often mark things out. Rhodey had passed him a few times. Odd thing was, Logan was rough-talking and often dropped consonants from the ends of some words, but his handwriting was a neat calligraphy."
7,13148322,Logan,Natasha,"Logan: I've been tracking you for weeks, Natasha. It's time to pay for what you've done. *draws his claws*

Natasha: Logan, you don't understand. I had no choice. They were going to kill me if I didn't do their bidding. *backs away slowly*

Logan: I don't care about your excuses. You betrayed us, Natasha. You betrayed me. *advances towards her*

Natasha: I did what I had to survive. You of all people should understand that. *raises her hands in defense*

Logan: Survival doesn't justify your actions. You've become just like them. *lunges at her*

Natasha: Logan, please! We can work this out. We used to be friends. *dodges his attack*

Logan: Friends don't betray each other, Natasha. Friends don't become assassins. *slashes at her*

Natasha: I never wanted this life, Logan. But it's the only one I've ever known. *blocks his attack*

Logan: That's not an excuse. You always had a choice. *grabs her by the collar*

Natasha: Maybe you're right. Maybe I did have a choice. But I made the wrong one. *struggles to break free*

Logan: It's too late for regrets now, Natasha. You made your bed, now lie in it. *tightens his grip*

Natasha: If you're going to kill me, then do it. But remember, we're not so different, you and I. *stares defiantly at him*

Logan: Don't compare yourself to me, Natasha. I may be a monster, but at least I'm not a traitor. *releases her and walks away*"
8,13148322,Lt. Howlett,Black Widow,"Tony: Lt. Howlett thinks he can find the Black Widow and capture her. We're asking permission for him to try.
Romanian representative: Are you certain he can successfully fight a highly trained assassin?
Tony: Yes. Seems, between wars, he travelled an awful lot. He's not only fluent in several languages but he's also proficient in several forms of martial arts, which removes the one advantage Romanoff would have had over him.
Chinese representative: His healing factor is certainly an advantage. You're certain it can defend against poisons and narcotics?
Tony: We tested it. Any foreign substances that come into his body, or even into contact with his blood, are instantly attacked by his antibodies and neutralised. The healing factor is why HYDRA's Winter Soldier experiments were ineffective on him."
9,13148322,Professor X,Tony Stark,"Professor X: Thank you for inviting us, Tony. It's good to see you again.
Tony Stark: Of course, Charles. You and Hank are always welcome here.
Beast: It's quite impressive what you've done with the place, Tony.
Tony Stark: Thanks, Hank. I've put a lot of time and money into making it the best headquarters for the Avengers.
Professor X: We appreciate your support. As you know, we're here to discuss a common goal.
Tony Stark: Yes, I've heard about the mutant registration act. It's a dangerous path they're heading down.
Beast: Indeed, Tony. Mutants are being treated as threats rather than individuals with unique abilities.
Professor X: We need to work together to protect the rights and safety of mutants everywhere.
Tony Stark: I agree, Charles. The Avengers are more than willing to help in any way we can.
Beast: That's good to hear, Tony. With our combined efforts, we can make a difference.
Professor X: Thank you, both. Together, we can ensure a better future for mutants and humans alike."
10,13148322,Scott,Professor,"Scott: I don't like it.
Professor: Scott, I have told you, I've already scanned Tony Stark. He is playing this straight. If we want to be accepted into society, we need to show society that we are willing to work with them.
Remy LeBeau: And I've met Logan. If the Accords were a load of crock, he would've given them a great big F-U and walked out - not signed them.
Hank: Added onto that, the amount of anti-mutant attacks since the event has dropped by 12%. The best way to drop it lower is to show the world more enhanced beings willing to work within the confines of the law. We need to show them that we are reasonable individuals; that the Rogue Avengers are the exception rather than the rule.
Scott: *reluctantly nodded*
Storm: What about the other mutants? You said they were loitering around.
Professor: They are unsure about precisely how safe this is. Many want to be pulled under the protection of some kind of law, but just as many are fearful of a set-up. They are waiting for somebody else to walk in and prove to them that the Accords are not the metaphorical cheese on the mousetrap."
11,13148322,Wolverine,Spider-Man,"
Wolverine: Hey, Spidey! You ready for another day of crime-fighting?

Spider-Man: You know it, Logan! With great power comes great responsibility, right?


Wolverine: That's right, kid. We've got a city to protect.

Spider-Man: Speaking of which, have you heard anything about the latest threat in town? Rumor has it that Magneto is causing trouble again.


Wolverine: Magneto, huh? That guy never learns. We better find him before he causes any real damage.


Spider-Man: Agreed. Let's swing into action, Wolverine!
"
12,13148322,Tony Stark,Dr. McCoy,"Tony: Good morning, gentlemen. Sorry to keep you waiting.
Dr. McCoy: Not at all, Dr. Stark. Thank you for making the time for us.
Tony: Now, you’ve looked through the copies of the Accords I gave you and made your own amendments?
Professor Xavier: We have. I must say, I was pleasantly surprised at the lack of issues we had with the Accords. I had thought there would be far more restrictive clauses in there.
Tony: Yes. Logan already went through them and pointed out everything that he thought would be problematic to the mutant community.
Dr. McCoy: And that’s exactly what Remy LeBeau theorised. He seems to have only missed out on issues a politically-minded individual would notice.
Tony: I ain’t a diplomat and I ain’t gonna try to be one.
Professor Xavier: I can hear you wondering about it, Tony. You can ask.
Tony: Given the nature of your powers, and the common way in which these powers manifest, how have mutants remained undetected to this day? Especially considering how your bunch have been pushing for peaceful human and mutant co-existence.
Dr. McCoy: There is a sub-branch of mutants. It is their belief that mutants as a whole would be safer if baseline humans are ignorant of our existence. They believe our right to the protection of the law are a fair price to pay for that safety.
Tony: If you tell me what power-sets I’m looking at, I should be able to set up some counteractants for them.
...
Tony: I expect FRIDAY told you the Professor and Hank want a word with you.
Logan: Yeah. What about?
Professor Xavier: My first question is this: I’d like to know your reasons for supporting the Accords.
Logan: My powers manifested when I was thirteen and I had to leave home. I know what happens out there. The UN were the first ones to define human rights as they stand now. I know the Accords were drafted as a response to the Walking Flag and his pack of mutts stomping all over the world like they owned it. Stark, at least, had regard for Sovereign borders, which was why they only talked to him.
Hank: I fail to understand why Steve Rogers behaved in the way he did.
Logan: Because he’s a self-righteous little shit.
Hank: Is the explanation really so simplistic?
Logan: Rogers is a simplistic guy. For him, life is simple. There’s good and bad, and he’s got the strangest need to be the hero of the story. So anyone who argues with him or disagrees with him any other way must be a bad person, and anyone who follows him like a dog is a good person.
Tony: Are you saying the whole reason Rogers treated me like I was morally bankrupt was because I didn’t agree with every word he said.
Logan: Well, that and two other reasons. Firstly, Rogers does not like to be confused, so he does not like people to use big words. Lazy ass doesn’t know how to put the words in context and he doesn’t try. So he glares at whoever’s talking in the hopes that they’ll dumb it down for him. The next reason is you were already Iron Man.
Charles: I should like to correct that."
13,13148322,Professor X,Avengers,"Professor X: We need to talk to you, Avengers. *The four mutants stood in front of the Rogue Avengers, their expressions serious.*
Steve Rogers: What is this about, Charles? *Steve crossed his arms, his tone defensive.*
Logan: We've heard about your recent actions. It's time to answer for them. *Logan's voice was gruff, his claws glinting in the sunlight.*
Natasha Romanoff: We don't answer to you mutants. We answer to the people. *Natasha's eyes narrowed, her stance defensive.*
Beast: Your actions have put innocent lives at risk. We can't let that go unpunished. *Beast's voice was calm but firm, his blue fur standing out against the green grass.*
Tony Stark: You think you're the judge and jury now, Charles? We're doing what we think is right. *Tony's voice was tinged with anger, his suit gleaming in the sunlight.*
Storm: We're not here to fight, but we won't let you continue down this path. *Storm's voice was steady, her eyes glowing with power.*
Clint Barton: You mutants always think you're better than us. We don't need your interference. *Clint's voice was filled with bitterness, his bow at the ready.*
Professor X: We're not here to assert our superiority. We're here to protect the world, just like you claim to be. *Professor X's voice was calm, his eyes piercing.*
Peter Parker: I don't know who's right anymore. All I know is that innocent people are getting hurt. *Peter's voice was filled with uncertainty, his suit wrinkled and torn.*
Logan: That's why we're here, kid. To make sure that doesn't happen anymore. *Logan's voice softened, his eyes meeting Peter's.*
Steve Rogers: We may not agree on everything, but we all want to protect the innocent. Let's find a way to work together. *Steve's voice was filled with determination, his shield at his side.*
Professor X: Agreed. It's time to put our differences aside and find a solution. *Professor X's voice was filled with hope, his wheelchair rolling forward.*"
14,13148322,Logan,Barnes,"Logan: I see your jaw healed. Barnes tell you who I was?
Rogers: He said who he thought you were, but that’s impossible. Lucky James was a soldier in the Second World War. You can’t possibly be him.
Logan: Luck had nothing to do with it, bub. *lifts his fist* SNIKT! *satisfied to see Rogers flinch back as he popped his claws*
Logan: I got a healing factor.
Logan: That we ain’t here to talk about. *walks away from the cell* We’re here to talk about your recent bout of bullshit.
Wilson: Hey, remember who you’re talking to!
Logan: And who’s that, mutt? Captain America. *smirks at him* I’m Canadian.
Clint: Wanda’s Sokovian and she still respects that he’s a hero.
Logan: No, she doesn’t. *The Professor wheeled forward. He then injected his mental voice into all of their heads.* Miss Maximoff views you all as a convenient way to escape the consequences of her frankly detestable actions."
15,13148322,Maximoff,Stark,"Maximoff: No! It was Stark's missile! Stark killed my parents!
Rogers: You're wrong. Tony--
Logan: Even Stane sold working weapons. If it didn't work, it was stripped down and never went into circulation.
Rogers: Who?
Logan: Obadiah Stane. What, you never heard of him? The guy that was selling weapons to terrorists behind Tony's back? And behind his old man's before him? Are you really so resistant to this century that you won't look up anything that happened since 1945?
Wilson: Oh, give him a break! I'd like to see you adjust to living out of your time.
Logan: Oh, I have, mutt.
Hank: Logan was born in 1829. He has adapted to not only social changes in that time, but every invention from then to now. He adapted to indoor plumbing, to the invention of the automobile, the semi-automatic rifle, the invention of the light bulb, of radar, of CCTV, of the internet. It is not that Mr. Rogers--
Rogers: Captain.
Hank: It is not that Mr. Rogers, is struggling to adapt. It is that he doesn't want to adapt. Perhaps that is part of why he dislikes Tony Stark so. Mr. Stark is a living, breathing representation of everything that Mr. Rogers wants to ignore.
Logan: Which brings us to the Accords.
Rogers: We're not signing them.
Logan: Bit late for that. You're being charged for international felonies, among some other shit, so you obviously don't care about Sovereign borders.
Storm: You caused the deaths of 47 people in Nigeria.
Rogers: More would have died if we hadn't been there.
Hank: How do you know that?
Rogers: What are you talking about?
Hank: You mistook which building Crossbones was targeting. Then you chased a baseline human terrorist through a crowded marketplace. This chase was what led to the deaths of those people - deaths which could have easily been avoided if you had contacted the ATS once you became aware of the issue.
Logan: ATS? The part of the Nigeria police force that deals with counter-terrorism.
Rogers: There wasn't time.
Hank: But there was time for you to set up a trap? I begin to think that Logan is right. Your entire sense of self-validation comes from being the hero all the time.
Rogers: We can't always save everyone, but we save everyone we can.
Storm: What about what happened in Bucharest?
Rogers: They were going to kill Bucky! He's innocent!
Storm: He was innocent of the Vienna bombing, yes. But the orders were actually 'shoot on sight, if the target becomes threatening'. The grenade the taskforce threw into the apartment was a stun grenade. It was designed to subdue, not to kill. The fact that he wasn't killed when you were caught clearly displays killing him was never the objective.
Logan: He punched you in the face and then Barnes turned his rifle on him.
Clint: That's why you beat Cap up, isn't it?
Logan: Yup.
Hank: On the contrary, Mr. Rogers, the Accords are a set of checks and balances that allow us to be considered human beings and, as such, allow us access to our human rights. They allow us to negotiate for our specific conditions, and our children finally have a support system in place for the unexpected event of their powers manifesting. The vast majority of the mutant and enhanced communities are heavily in favor of them. Yourself and your cohort are the exception to the rule.
Storm: We came here to tell you that. You may think that the Accords are a bad thing, but the rest of the world does not agree. Your selfish actions made things worse for the thousands of other super-powered individuals across the planet because you were only interested in what you wanted. Tony and Logan were the ones who made it better."
16,13148322,Peter Parker,Tony Stark,"Peter Parker: So what happens now?
Tony Stark: Logan's joining the X-Men. The UN's got some recommendations for a new batch of Avengers. Barnes will likely spend quite a while in a psychiatric hospital. Turns out the brainwashing program worked by tearing up a fair bit of his grey matter.
Peter Parker: Is that why it didn't work on Logan?
Tony Stark: Yup. Turns out, the reason those other Winter Soldiers didn't work either was because Logan not only induced doubt on them but he induced a pack mentality in them and they turned on their handlers. It was almost like what happened to Barnes when Rogers was around.
Peter Parker: So how did that Zemo guy play it so well? Can he see the future or something?
Tony Stark: Nope. When HYDRA decided to kill someone, they would have their profilers study the target's behaviour for a while, as well as the behaviour of the people around the target, in order to find the cleanest way to kill them without being caught. Zemo was one of these profilers. He was trained so he could pick out Rogers' behaviour in a short amount of time and the behaviour of the rest of us too. Apparently, Rogers had a small group to study compared to what he's used to.
Peter Parker: So it was really easy.
Tony Stark: Very easy.
Peter Parker: What about Scott Lang? He broke parole, didn't he?
Tony Stark: Yup. His ex-wife called Pepper to pass on an apology for his behaviour to me and explain that he's an idiot. I also got a phone call from Hope Van Dyne to apologise for the exact same thing. She also made her father apologise to me. On facetime. The man looked so constipated.
Peter Parker: What's his problem with you?
Tony Stark: A feud with my father, basically.
Peter Parker: That doesn't make sense! That's your dad, not you!
Tony Stark: Happens a lot actually. People from the same family often get tarred with the same brush. It's the same reason stereotyping happens. It's just easier to make generalisations than it is to get to know independent people.
Peter Parker: So...what happens with the Avengers now?
Tony Stark: We reform. You still want to be an Avenger?
Peter Parker: Yeah!
Tony Stark: Well, you'll go into training until you're 18 then. They're drawing up a set of guidelines for Avengers recruitment and I'm sure minors will come into it if they haven't already.
Peter Parker: 18? But that's ages away!
Tony Stark: Well, it'd be the same if you wanted to join the police force. Besides, Pep would kill us if we tried to skip it.
Peter Parker: Miss Potts is really scary.
Tony Stark: Yes, she is. How'd your aunt take it?
Peter Parker: She thought I was joking at first. So I stuck to the ceiling. Then she got mad at me.
Tony Stark: Of course she did. Her 15-year-old nephew is running around fighting crime. That'd send any parent through the roof.
Peter Parker: *grimaces*
Tony Stark: In the meantime, I designed a new suit for you. Tell me what you think of this.
Peter Parker: *grins*"
