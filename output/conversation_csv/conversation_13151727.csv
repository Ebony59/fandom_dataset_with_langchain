0,13151727,Regulus,Haria,"Regulus: Are you alright? *staring at the young woman with long red hair and green eyes*
Haria: Just hunting horcruxes. *mischievous smile*
Regulus: How many does he have? *demanding*
Haria: At this point, there's five. Diary, ring, locket, cup, and diadem. *using her fingers to list*
Regulus: How do you know all of this?
Haria: A girl has to keep her secrets. *mischievous smile and wink*
Regulus: You're not doing this without me."
1,13151727,Regulus,Girl,"Regulus: You need to get the locket. I know this isn't the real one.
Girl: You're not doing this without me.
Regulus: Fine. Your entry fee is the locket.
Girl: *mutter something that he didn't catch*
...
Girl: Let's not discuss my parents.
Regulus: *frowns and nods in agreement*
...
Haria: Lady Haria Jasmine Potter.
Regulus: *frowns*
Haria: Let's not discuss my parents.
Regulus: *nods in agreement*
...
Haria: *takes a seat on the couch*
Regulus: *joins on the couch*
...
Regulus: *stares at the items in the chest*
Haria: With the addition of the locket, they were over halfway through gathering the horcruxes.
...
Haria: *removes the Dark Mark from Regulus' forearm*
...
Haria: Lucius Malfoy had the diary and Bellatrix Lestrange had the cup.
Regulus: *nods in agreement*
...
Regulus: Haria's plans were worthy of a Slytherin.
...
Rodolphus: *hands over the cup*"
2,13151727,Regulus,Rodolphus,"Regulus: The man didn't even bother talking to his wife before handing over the cup.
Rodolphus: When it came to his wife, Rodolphus was an idiot in love – and he would do anything for her.
Regulus: Rodolphus handed over the cup, and he made Regulus take a magical vow not to disown his wife.
Regulus: If the man ever discovered the truth about his wife, Regulus would be willing to grant a divorce and he would disown his cousin.
Regulus: Her actions were shaming the House of Black, but as long as her lord husband was willing to tolerate her and her actions, Regulus was willing to ignore them.
Narcissa: Narcissa Malfoy took over a week to appear with the diary.
Narcissa: Like a good pure-blood witch, Narcissa kept her questions and comments to herself.
Narcissa: Before departing, Narcissa had Regulus take a magical oath to swear he would never use the threat of disownment and divorce to manipulate her or her husband.
Regulus: In her rush to secure the oath and leave, Narcissa overlooked the detail of Regulus ordering someone else to carry out the same actions.
Regulus: With the diary and the cup, Regulus and Haria possessed all five of the horcruxes.
Regulus: Apparently, Regulus had a little bit of Gryffindor in him.
Regulus: A wizard was never allowed to enter a witch's bedroom and vice versa.
Regulus: All it took for Regulus to break the customs was a large curiosity about his strange companion and hours alone in her hotel room.
Regulus: In the large closet, Regulus found an alarming amount of clothing, both Muggle and magical.
Regulus: Next, he looked in the dresser. There were even more clothes in there.
Regulus: With a red face, Regulus only peaked in the first two drawers, where he found her unmentionables.
Regulus: Under the bed were more Muggle shoeboxes.
Regulus: Curious if they were actually shoes, Regulus peaked inside of two boxes and he discovered shoes.
Regulus: In a third shoebox, he found a collection of photographs and mementos.
Regulus: He recognized a younger Haria in several.
Regulus: In some, she was with a bushy-haired witch and a redheaded wizard.
Regulus: In others, Haria or the redhead were with several other redheads, six children and two adults.
Regulus: In some photographs, Haria was holding a young boy.
Regulus: In the magical photographs, Regulus noted the young child was a metamorphagus and he had the high cheekbones of a Black.
Regulus: In some other photographs, Regulus found the child with a couple, an older Remus Lupin and a witch with bubble gum hair.
Regulus: Both the witch and her child had changing hair colors.
Regulus: Regulus last saw Remus Lupin a few weeks ago in Diagon Alley with Sirius and James Potter.
Regulus: Upon finding a photograph of Lily and James Potter with a daughter, Regulus was certain he knew where Haria came from.
Regulus: Haria was from the future.
Regulus: Time travel was only a magical theory at the moment, something only Unspeakables were experimenting with.
Haria: When Haria returned hours later, well into the evening, she found Regulus had several photographs spread across..."
3,13151727,Regulus,Haria,"Regulus: They're gone, *catches the amber crystal*.
Haria: We'll have to compete sometime.
Regulus: Let's.
Haria: I'll answer a few questions.
Regulus: How did Lily and James die?
Haria: Murdered by Tom when I was fifteen-months. I got this that night. I survived the Killing Curse, defeated him, became a living horcruxes and the Girl-Who-Lived.
Regulus: What happened to my family?
Haria: You died in the cave, Orion of a 'broken heart' a few months after you, Walburga lived to six and she died of heart failure. Sirius was thrown into Azkaban without a trial, and he escaped when I was thirteen and murdered by Bellatrix two years later. Kreacher went crazy trying to destroy the locket and mourning you. After I destroyed the locket, he returned to being a good house-elf.
Regulus: Kreacher.
Kreacher: *appears*
Regulus: I need you to deliver this to my grandfather and I want you to retrieve the Pure-Heart Betrothal Ring.
Kreacher: *eyes widened*"
4,13151727,Regulus,Haria,"Regulus: Of course, Master Regulus, *Kreacher said. He bowed before departing with a pop.*
...
Regulus: It was a lovely autumn afternoon with unusually warm temperaments and the sun was shining. Due to the nice weather, there were several people spending their afternoon in and around the alley. It was refreshing to see people enjoying normal, mundane activities. For a moment, Regulus could pretend it was a normal afternoon – that there wasn't a war going on and people were too terrified to even speak the Dark Lord's name. That moment quickly passed – and it was shattered into tiny pieces – with the arrival of Death Eaters. It happened suddenly. One second, Regulus was watching Haria lick her spoon clean and the next, screaming and shouting filled the alleyway.
Regulus: When the scream started, Haria leapt to her feet and she pulled out two wands – since when did she have two? – before she started directing people to safety and casting Shield Charms. After watching her for a minute, Regulus joined her. Instead of casting Shield Charms, he started casting offensive hexes and curses. There was no point in fighting the Death Eaters with Stunners and the Disarming Charm when they used illegal curses and dark magic.
Regulus: Regulus remained by Haria's side, guarding her back. They made a decent team. With her two wands, Haria fired off a combination of defensive and offensive spells. She mixed light magic and dark magic. In comparison, Regulus stuck with offensive spells and curses, most of which bordered on illegal. As a former Death Eater, Regulus knew how they fought and he knew how to counter those attacks.
Regulus: Every so often, Regulus would glance over at his partner. Her green eyes were narrowed as she shot spell after spell at various Death Eaters, and at times she would physically dodge spells sent at her. Haria moved like an experienced duelist and fighter – which made sense given what Regulus knew about her.
Regulus: With the Death Eaters' renewed energy and the new chaos, Regulus lost sight of Haria. One moment, she was within an arm's reach and the next, she was gone. It took Regulus several seconds to locate her. Her green eyes were narrowed as she took out Death Eater after Death Eater between her and her target, the Dark Lord – who seemed oblivious to the incoming threat.
Regulus: Regulus watched, somewhat helplessly, as Haria advanced on the Dark Lord. He knew she could take him, and he knew the Dark Lord was vulnerable. With divided attention, Regulus tried to focus on the Death Eaters as he moved towards his partner's side, ignoring Haria's advancement. If he could get close enough, then Regulus could keep everyone from interfering with Haria's attack."
5,13151727,Regulus,Haria,"Regulus: If he could get close enough, then Regulus could keep everyone from interfering with Haria's attack.
Regulus: Regulus rushed to Haria's side while she headed to the Dark Lord.
Haria: *ignoring Haria's advancement*
Regulus: Regulus couldn't get there fast enough while Haria was going too fast.
Regulus: As Regulus made his way through the Death Eaters, Albus Dumbledore arrived in flames with his phoenix.
Haria: *glanced at Dumbledore and rolled her green eyes before returning her attention to her task*
Dark Lord: You dare attack me, girl? Do you know what you've done?
Haria: Plenty, Tom. The question should be: do you know what I've done?
Dark Lord: Don't use that name, girl!
Haria: Why not? It's the name your mother gave you with her dying breath, Tom Marvolo Riddle.
Haria: She's mine!
Voldemort: Tom, you're fight is with me, leave the girl out of it.
Haria: Sorry, Albus, but this fight is mine, *glancing over at the Headmaster for a few seconds*
Dark Lord: Bow to me, girl, and I'll give you a quick death.
Haria: Pass.
Haria: Avada Kedvra!
Regulus: Regulus held his breath. He recognized that gleam in Haria's green eyes. She was up to something.
Haria: Sectumsempra!"
6,13151727,Regulus,Haria,"Regulus: Sectumsempra! *moving the second wand in a slashing motion*
Haria: *collapsed into Regulus' arms*
Regulus: Kreacher!
Kreacher: Master Regulus!
Regulus: I need you to retrieve some things for Haria.
Kreacher: Of course, Master. What does Beloved need Kreacher to get?
Regulus: *gazing at Haria*
Regulus: I want you by my side. I love you.
Haria: *placing the ring on her finger*"
7,13151727,Regulus,Haria,"Regulus: *leans forward and kisses Haria*
Haria: *returns the kiss*
Regulus: I want you by my side. I love you.
Haria: *breathless* I love you too. I have one non-negotiable item.
Regulus: *sits up straight* What is it?
Haria: We're naming our first-born after my best friend.
Regulus: Hermione?
Haria: *nods* If it's a boy, I'm open to the name Mercury.

Haria: I'm selling my interview to The Quibbler.
Regulus: *looks at the newspapers and magazines in disgust*

Haria: There was a hunt for Regulus Black, the last person seen with the Girl-Who-Won.
Regulus: *no response*

Haria: Once Haria was fully recovered from her magical exhaustion and depleted magical core, it was time to return to London.
Regulus: *no response*

Haria: I hope the master bedroom has a big closet.
Regulus: If it doesn't, I'll make you one.

Haria: I never had my own clothes or shoes.
Regulus: *no response*

Regulus: *angry at Haria's relatives*

Haria: *checks out and settles the bill at the front desk*"
8,13151727,Regulus,Amelia Bones,"Regulus: Thank you for meeting with us.
Amelia Bones: I am pleased to be here. I'm Amelia Bones.
Haria: You can call me Haria Jasmine. *shows her left hand with the Pure-Heart Betrothal Ring*
Marius: Let us begin.
Bones: *nods and passes the parchment to Marius* These questions are fair. I will want a copy.
Marius: The questions were simple and centered around the events of Diagon Alley and the duel between Haria and the Dark Lord. Regulus was questioned about his alleged status as a Death Eater. With a smile, he showed off the unmarked skin of his left forearm. Haria and Regulus told the woman about the five horcruxes, which caused Bones to pale. They would need to meet with the Unspeakables so the Unspeakables could verify there weren't any others."

Haria: Haria and Regulus told the woman about the five horcruxes, which caused Bones to pale.
Regulus: They would need to meet with the Unspeakables so the Unspeakables could verify there weren't any others.
Marius: Three days after the meeting with Amelia Bones, Marius arranged for Haria to sell her interview to The Quibbler.
Marius: After the article was released, Marius sold the right of Regulus and Haria's upcoming wedding for another galleon.
Regulus: Regulus spotted his brother in attendance, hanging around James Potter and the known members of Dumbledore's Order of the Phoenix.
Regulus: If Regulus had to guess, they would assume he did something to Haria.
Haria: Haria remained close to Regulus' side for the event.
Sirius: At some point, Regulus and Haria took to the dance floor. Sirius settled in for a better view.
Regulus: Regulus' grip on his betrothed tighten. Haria was his!"
