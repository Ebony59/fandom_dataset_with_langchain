0,13151907,James,Saturn,"James: It's nice to see you, again.
Saturn: You too.
James: Do you want to grab some ice cream and catch up?
Saturn: I can't. I have to get to work.
James: Mind if I escort you?
Saturn: *blushes and nods*
James: Where am I taking you?
Saturn: Rosa Lee Teabag.

Narcissa: What's your plot?
James: What are you talking about?
Narcissa: What are you doing with Saturn?
James: Talking to her. How is this any of your business, Black?
Narcissa: It's not, anymore, not since Arcturus discovered she was a bastard.
James: *eyes widen*
Narcissa: But I make this my business because Saturn is family – no matter what Arcturus or anyone else says about it. Blacks stand by one another.

James: *walks away without acknowledging Narcissa*

James: *plans with his mother*
James: *approaches Rosa Lee Teabag*"
1,13151907,James,Saturn,"James: Evenin', Jamie. *approached the counter where Ivy was working, passing Saturn without a glance* You better treat her right.
Saturn: What are you up to?
James: She's never cared about me, and I decided that I deserve better. I deserve someone who loves me as much as I love her – someone like you. Saturn, you're the one for me, and I want to spend the rest of my life with you.
Saturn: You might change your mind after I tell you something.
James: I already know. My mother had planned everything.
Saturn: How?
James: Narcissa still cares. *remembered from their shared time at Hogwarts that Saturn was close to Narcissa* What's your answer?"
2,13151907,Saturn,James,"Saturn: Narcissa still cares.
James: What's your answer?
Saturn: I've missed her.
James: This is for you. *presenting the Scared Heart Betrothal Ring to Saturn*
Robert: Who presence the bride?
Ivy: I do.
Robert: Who stands with the groom?
Frank: I do.
Robert: In the name of Merlin's Holy Light, we are gathered here to bring forth bind two together in a magical bond to become one.
Robert: In the spirit of all things good, James Charles Potter, do you promise to uphold all things sacred and right by Saturn Melania Black until death?
James: I do.
Robert: Saturn Melania Black, do you promise to uphold all things sacred and right by James Charles Potter until death?
Saturn: I do.
James: With this ring I bond with thee forevermore until the day we part.
Saturn: With this ring I bond with thee forevermore until the day we part.

James: *leaning forward and pressing his lips to Saturn's.*
...
Saturn: *using Ivy and Alexander's old textbooks and purchasing second-hand books from the bookstore across from Rosa Lee Teabag.*
Saturn: *fallen behind, and she only had a few days to catch up.*
Saturn: *Armed with James' and Frank's notes from first through fifth year along with stacks of textbooks and a time-turner, Saturn got to work.*
...
Saturn: *Thanks to the time-turner, Saturn was able to study while spending time with her husband.*
Saturn: *On her second repeat of the morning, she would spend sometime with James before she resumed studying in their room into the early evening.*
Saturn: *The evening was spent with James and his parents, away from books and studying.*
...
Saturn: *Early that morning, she was escorted to the Ministry of Magic by Charlus.*
Saturn: *That evening, Saturn was drained. She barely remembered leaving the Ministry.*
Saturn: *Saturn returned to the Department of Education for farther testing the next day.*
...
Saturn: *Two days later, an owl delivered her results.*
Saturn: *Saturn spent the reminder of the Winter Holidays studying with James and Frank, both of whom were eager to help.*
...
James: *On the day to return to Hogwarts, James and Saturn used the floo system to travel from Potter Manor to Professor McGonagall's office.*
James: *James spent the time moving into his and Saturn's new courters.*
...
James: *James entered the Great Hall with the students who remained in the castle over the Winter Holidays.*
James: *taking a seat at the Gryffindor table, saving the seats on either side of him for Frank and Saturn.*"
4,13151907,James,Lily Evans,"James: Yes, Miss Evans? *focused on his Transfiguration assignment*
Lily Evans: I've noticed how much you've matured, James.
James: Thank you, Miss Evans.
Lily Evans: I was hoping that you be willing to escort me to Diagon Alley?
James: What? *shocked*
Lily Evans: I think I love you. Will you go out with me?
James: No."
5,13151907,Evans,James,"Evans: I was hoping that you be willing to escort me to Diagon Alley?
James: What?
Evans: I think I love you. Will you go out with me?
James: No.
Evans: You have a lot of nerve, Evans!
Saturn: Detention!
Evans: What goes on between me and James is none of your business.
Saturn: It is my business.
Evans: That won't last long! James loved me before you.
Saturn: He never loved you, he only fancied you.
Evans: I'll see you expelled for slapping a Prefect.
Saturn: How does slapping you mean I support Voldemort?
Evans: You clearly hate muggle-borns.
Saturn: In order to maintain pure-blood supremacy, you tricked James into marrying you.
James: You owe my wife an apology.
Evans: I owe her nothing.
James: No, she doesn't.
Evans: You're just like her. You're nothing but a pure-blood supremacist and a future Death Eater.
Saturn: I love you.
James: I love you, too."
6,13151907,Saturn,Heiress Potter,"Saturn: It's Heiress Potter.
Walburga: Now, now, daughter, there's no need for such formalities.
Saturn: I am Heiress Potter, Mrs. Black.
Walburga: How dare you address me as such. I am Lady Black to you!
James: you can't be Lady Black since Lord Arcturus Black isn't your husband, and you can't be Heiress Black since Regulus is the heir of Lord Black.
Orion: Heir Potter, we're here to collect Saturn and break your bonding.
James: You have no grounds. We were bonded in Merlin's Holy Light Ceremony, and magic has accepted our bonding.
Walburga: But you never received permission from our family.
James: As a disowned bastard, Saturn can't have any contact with your family, therefore, you aren't her family. If you check the records, I received permission from Miss Ivy Fawley.
Orion: This wasn't going according to his father's plans. Arcturus Black wanted Saturn bonded with the Dark Lord. When Saturn refused, she was disowned for being a bastard. She would be allowed to return to the family when she accepted the bonding with the Dark Lord. Unfortunately, Saturn found a living on her own, and she successfully bonded with someone else a day before her seventeenth birthday."
