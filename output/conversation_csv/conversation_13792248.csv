1,13792248,Harry,Sirius,"Harry: Well, I'm off.
Dursleys: *ignored him*
Harry: All right, I will. Have a good summer then.
Uncle Vernon: Get that bloody bird out of the kitchen.
Harry: *bit down the urge to snap back* All right, I will. Have a good summer then.
Harry: Good morning, Harry.
Sirius: Morning.
Harry: When are we leaving?
Sirius: As soon as our ride shows up.
Harry: *scanned the street with Sirius*
Harry: Neither of you said anything!"
2,13792248,Harry,Lupin,"Harry: Neither of you said anything!
Lupin: We weren’t sure it was going to work out, but Moony has kindly offered to take us in until I fix up my place.
Sirius: It’s my pleasure, really.
Harry: Ready to go, Harry?
Sirius: Yes, let’s go.

Lupin: What do you normally like to do over the summer, Harry?
Sirius: Now, I want to hear all about Moony as a professor. Moony only says he was all right, but I reckon he’s selling himself short.
Harry: All right? You were the best Defense Against the Dark Arts professor we ever had!
Lupin: It’s not like I had much in the way of competition.
Harry: He was better than most of our other professors, too. Our first class, he took us to take care of a Boggart and….
Sirius: You always were sly.
Lupin: Yes, well.

Harry: I just wish I’d been there to see it.
Lupin: *smiling*"
3,13792248,Harry,Lupin,"Waitress: I just wanted to say, I think you’re an adorable family.
Harry: Thank you.

Harry: How do you know so much about Muggle money?
Lupin: My mother was a Muggle. And sometimes it’s been easier to find work in the Muggle world than the wizarding one.
Sirius: I could kill Snape.
Lupin: I’m very aware, Sirius.
Harry: Sirius has a point. It’s not fair he got Professor Lupin sacked.
Lupin: I resigned.
Sirius: Under pressure!
Harry: What are you doing now?
Lupin: What I’ve always done. Odd jobs. A bit of research and editing.
Sirius: He’s very smart, our Moony.
Harry: *not sure who Sirius is speaking to*

Lupin: It’s small.
Harry: It’s amazing.

Lupin: You’ll be in my old room. It’s just upstairs. It shouldn’t smell too dusty.

Harry: *nodded and raced up the stairs, eager to see his new room*

Lupin: Lupin’s old room didn’t smell dusty, but it did smell like it had been aired out recently and hastily."
4,13792248,Lupin,Harry,"Lupin: “You’ll be in my old room. It’s just upstairs. It shouldn’t smell too dusty.”
Harry: *nods and races up the stairs*
Harry: *opens the window for Hedwig*
Harry: *examines the bookshelf*
Harry: *grabs a book and flips through it*
Harry: *stares at the photograph*
Lupin: “I hope it’s not too small.”
Harry: “No! It’s brilliant. Really.”
Lupin: “What is that?”
Harry: *shows them the photograph*
Sirius: “I don’t like to think of him in Azkaban.”
Lupin: “If anyone deserves it…”
Sirius: “No one deserves it.”
Sirius: “What year do you think this was?”
Lupin: “Summer after fifth year.”
Lupin: “In any case, I know it’s early, Harry, but any ideas on what you’d like for dinner?”
Harry: “Anything.”"
5,13792248,Harry,Lupin,"Harry: I want to put it up.
Lupin: Of course.
Harry: Only, maybe not tonight.
***
Harry: Where's Sirius sleeping?
Sirius: I've been sleeping on the couch.
Lupin: Tea, Harry?
Sirius: Moony's already been up ages. He's out in the garden.
Harry: Sirius says you should come in for breakfast.
Lupin: How nice. I could get used to this.
Harry: Me, too.
***
Harry: It's nice to be useful. It's nice to be outside.
Harry: I might"
6,13792248,Sirius,Lupin,"Sirius: It’s nice to be useful. It’s nice to be outside. I might try to get a job eventually, if anyone’ll have me. But for now it’s nice to just do this.
Lupin: I hear Hogwarts is hiring. I could put in a good word for you with the headmaster.
Sirius: *barks of laughter*
Sirius: As good as your dad. Maybe even better.
Harry: I just have a really good broom.
Sirius: I’m pretty sure even the best broom is only as good as the person flying it. At least I remember your dad saying something like that.
Harry: Did you ever play with him? On the Gryffindor Quidditch team, I mean.
Sirius: Merlin, no. I always had better things to do with my time than practice. And Prongs would have booted me off the team in a fortnight for insubordination. Moony played a couple times, though.
Harry: What?
Sirius: He’s a fair flyer, and he has a good eye. So Prongs made him sub on once or twice when one of their usual chasers was out.
Harry: How come he never properly joined?
Sirius: Quidditch schedules don’t necessarily align with the moon’s. Also Moony doesn’t really care for Quidditch, even if he’s decent at it.
Sirius: But if you asked, I bet he’d be willing to help you practice, too.
Lupin: Oh, Sirius hated Lily at first. I always thought he was jealous.
Sirius: I wasn’t jealous. I had – *stops abruptly*
Lupin: In any case, I do think he was jealous of how much time James spent with her, especially after he became Head Boy.
Lupin: *mouths* Jealous."
7,13792248,Sirius,Moony,"Sirius: Moony’s taste in books is much more highbrow than mine. I used to read these to annoy my mother, but then I got a bit addicted to them. Let’s see if I still am.
Harry: What is this?
Sirius: Moony’s taste in books is much more highbrow than mine. I used to read these to annoy my mother, but then I got a bit addicted to them. Let’s see if I still am.
Harry: *shook his head, still laughing a bit*
Sirius: These are fun, too. I might even allow you to read some of these.
Harry: I think I have enough to read just from the books Lupin already owns.
Sirius: *laughed* Careful, Harry, or you might end up"
8,13792248,Lupin,Harry,"Lupin: Are you two done? *pops his head into the aisle* Because I’ve found some copies of Lily’s old cookbooks.
Harry: Yes, *still juggling Sirius's romances* Unless Sirius needs something else.
Sirius: These should last me for a while. *sails to the counter and paid for the lot.*

Lupin: Ah, *sees what book Harry was reading* That's one of my favorites. My mother gave it to me the summer before I left for Hogwarts. She said if I were going to learn how to be a wizard, I should have a good example. I think I read it every summer for, well, for years.
Harry: *reading the underlined passage* Now, in their love, which was stronger, there were the seeds of hatred and fear and confusion growing at the same time: for love can exist with hatred, each preying on the other, and this is what gives it its greatest fury.

Lupin: He has a place in London. *explains to Harry as they cook* I don’t think it’s fit for human habitation at the moment.
Sirius: It wasn’t fit for human habitation when humans lived there. *sweeps in like a storm* Was it that bad?
Lupin: *waves his wand to dry Sirius and the floor* Thanks.
Sirius: *sits down heavily* Thanks."
9,13792248,Lupin,Sirius,"Lupin: Was it that bad? *looking at the stove, not at Sirius*
Sirius: *snorts*
Harry: *looking between the two of them, waiting for either to say more*
Lupin: *focused on cooking*
Sirius: *glaring out into the middle distance*
Harry: *pours Sirius a cup of tea and brings it to him* What is your house like?
Sirius: *gazes flicks to Harry, startled* It’s my… family’s house. Grimmauld Place. My cousin Narcissa is married to Lucius Malfoy, to give you a sense of what my family is like. Was like.
Harry: That surprised me. Your parents’ old place?
Sirius: *glances at Lupin, but Lupin is still turned away, prodding at the soup* I suppose so. *looks away*

Snape: *stands in the middle of the pathway, hunched and scowling, holding something in his hands*
Harry: *runs downstairs and sits on the steps, peering at Snape and Lupin through the balusters*
Snape: *steps inside with a sniff of disdain* Your walkway could use some repairs, Lupin.
Lupin: *takes the goblet from Snape* Thank you for this, Severus. And for the note on my walkway. I always appreciate your observations. You’re welcome to floo next time, if you’d prefer.
Harry: *scowls at Snape* Aren’t you going to clean that up, professor? *points at the mud still splattered across the floor*
Snape: *leaves without saying anything else*"
10,13792248,Harry,Snape,"Harry: “Aren’t you going to clean that up, professor?” he said, pointing at the mud still splattered across the floor.
Snape: Snape laughed, a slimy, chilly noise, then smiled at Lupin unpleasantly. “I see your parenting leaves as much to be desired as your teaching.”
Harry: “He’s a great teacher!” said Harry. He leapt down the last couple steps to face Snape. Lupin moved swiftly, so that he was suddenly in between them.
Lupin: “Thank you, Severus,” he said firmly, directing Snape towards the door. “I look forward to seeing you tomorrow.”
Snape: Snape slammed the door shut behind him. Lupin sighed, his shoulders dropping. He surveyed the mud in the entryway and then lifted his wand in a sweeping motion, washing it all away.

Sirius: “You could just let me try!”
Lupin: “And if it doesn’t work, Sirius? When was the last time you made something that complicated?”
Sirius: “I can do it, Moony.”

Sirius: “We have a cauldron, Snape,” said Sirius forebodingly, his arms crossed over his chest.
Snape: Snape smiled thinly. “Perhaps I’m wrong, but I doubt Lupin could afford the quality of cauldron needed for this potion.”
Lupin: “Perhaps,” said Lupin quickly, loud enough to cover whatever Sirius had opened his mouth to say. “Regardless, I appreciate your offer to help Sirius with the potion, Severus.”

Harry: “Er…” Harry looked between Sirius and Snape. They both ignored him. It was odd to see Snape hate someone more than he hated Harry, but Harry didn’t think he’d be able to help by sticking around. He shrugged.
Lupin: “All right,” he said."
11,13792248,Harry,Sirius,"Harry: You are here.
Sirius: You're up early.
Harry: Moony's feeling a little under the weather. I, uh. Was just checking on him.
Harry: Are you nervous?
Sirius: I suppose. I wouldn't be surprised if Snivellus told me something wrong to deliberately botch it.
Harry: It'll work.
Sirius: Thank you for the vote of confidence. But whether or not it works, you'll be staying with the Weasleys tonight.
Harry: I don't mind staying here. It's what my dad would do, right?
Lupin: But Prongs wasn't exactly known for his wisdom, Harry.
Lupin: Sorry, Harry. But Moony and I actually agree on this point.
Lupin: I appreciate the solidarity though. But I'll manage fine with Padfoot.
Mrs. Weasley: You might as well as get some rest anyway. I won't send you back ill."
12,13792248,Harry,Ron,"Harry: How do you think they're doing?
Ron: He took the potion, didn't he? And he has Sirius with him, and they said it helped to have another animal around. Lupin’s probably doing better than he has in a while, if that’s the case.
Harry: Yeah...
Ron: So they're probably just... doing what we're doing, but not human.
Harry: Do you ever worry about your parents?
Ron: Yeah, When Dad’s in trouble at work, or when they fight, or when Mum’s really stressed about money or something Fred and George have done. It’s only natural.
Harry: Right, I know they’ll be all right. I just…
Ron: *nodded sympathetically and patted Harry’s arm*
Ron: They will. And, here, I know what’ll cheer you up. I’m not really supposed to say anything yet, but… Dad’s got tickets to the Quidditch World Cup final, and he already said you could come.

Sirius: How is he? Did the potion work?
Harry: He’s fine, and yes, It was a much easier transformation than it used to be.
Harry: So why are you angry?
Sirius: I’m not. I’m just. *paused, and then laughed abruptly* I guess I am angry.
Harry: *gave him a patient look*
Sirius: I’m not angry at you, *clapping Harry on the back* Now come on. Let’s get home before Remus kills himself trying to be self-sufficient.

Lupin: *cleared his throat as Harry turned on the faucet for a glass of water*
Harry: Padfoot and I have been discussing it, Harry, and if you’d like, Hermione and Ron would be welcome to visit for a bit. Maybe we could even have a birthday party for you.
Harry: I’ve never had a birthday party before.
Lupin: *stepped away from Sirius and smiled at Harry kindly* Give it some thought."
13,13792248,Harry,Lupin,"Harry: Give it some thought. It doesn’t have to be big if you don’t want it to be.
Lupin: I think that a birthday party could be fun.
***
Mrs. Weasley: Oh, I wish we’d had more notice! There wasn’t nearly enough time to get everything prepared.
Harry: Honestly this is more than enough.
Fred: You're telling me they’re Moony and Padfoot? Moony and Padfoot are our favorite professor slash werewolf and an infamous but wrongfully convicted mass murderer?
George: Fred, you may need to catch me. I'm feeling rather faint all of the sudden.
Harry: *grinning and leaving them to their shock*
Hagrid: I’m ‘fraid Dumbledore can’t make it. Big things are afoot at Hogwarts this year.
Harry: Thank you! And thank you for coming. How’s Buckbeak?
Hagrid: Well, very well, thanks t’ what you and Hermione did for him.
Harry: It’s been really nice.
Neville: Thanks so much for inviting me, Harry. You know it was my birthday yesterday.
Harry: It should be a joint party then. I reckon we can change the cake.
Neville: Oh, no. You don’t have to - I didn’t mean.
Harry: We should do it! I’d like to."
14,13792248,Harry,Neville,"Harry: It should be a joint party then. I reckon we can change the cake.
Neville: Oh, no. You don’t have to - I didn’t mean.
Harry: We should do it! I’d like to.
Hermione: You’re so lucky to get to spend the summer with Professor Lupin.
Harry: Is everything all right?
Sirius: Everything’s wonderful, Harry.
Harry: We just came in to tell you we’re about to have the cake.
Ron: What do you reckon that was about?
Harry: Too much wine?
Hermione: I couldn't really tell. Sirius’s back was turned, and he was standing in front of Professor Lupin…
Harry: That doesn't seem that strange. I’ve caught them like that loads of times.
Hermione: I'm sure it wasn't strange! Oh, look! Is that Ginny? I've been meaning to talk to her all evening.
Molly: Come on now, Harry. You, too, Neville. The cake’s ready.
Harry: I’m not really used to this either.
Harry: There wasn’t a gift, he thought, that could compare to this."
15,13792248,Hermione,Harry,"Hermione: I could sleep on the couch.
Harry: But that’s where Sirius sleeps.
Lupin: I think it’s all right if Hermione shares with you and Ron, Harry. As long as you think you’ll have enough space.

Hermione: It’s not really my business to ask, but... is something going on between Sirius and Professor Lupin?
Ron: What do you mean?
Hermione: Just, I don’t know. They seem very happy around each other. Professor Lupin’s much happier than we saw him all last year.
Harry: Well, yeah. He got one of his best friends back.
Ron: I think they’re… together. I think they were, you know. Snogging. When we walked in on them.
Hermione: You’ve been reading too many of Sirius’s novels.
Ron: Would you have believed me last year if I’d told you Professor Lupin was a werewolf?
Ron: So why not believe me now? Honestly, you both have the observational skills of a flobberworm.
Harry: That's not true!
Ron: Well, there’s… There's the fact Harry’s gotten taller! Or you've gotten shorter, Hermione.
Hermione: I have not!

Hermione: *watching Lupin and Sirius thoughtfully*
Harry: *watching them more carefully, too*
Harry: But surely those things could just be friendly, too?
Harry: But if it weren’t just friendly, if they were together..."
16,13792248,Sirius,Remus,"Sirius: I know what I want, Remus.
Lupin: It’s not about what we want, Sirius.
Sirius: What are you talking about? Harry loves it here.
Lupin: Harry is fourteen.
Sirius: So? Moony – think what James and Lily would have wanted.
Lupin: How dare you bring James and Lily into this?
Sirius: Harry deserves to be raised by people who love him!
Lupin: I did it for thirteen years. What do you think will happen when word gets out Harry Potter lives with a werewolf? What do you think the Ministry will do? What do you think they’ll do to Arthur if they found out he knew and didn’t say anything? No, Sirius. I won’t have it. This has been fun, but you have to realize it can’t be like this forever.
Sirius: Why not? It doesn’t matter to me that you’re a werewolf! It doesn’t matter to Harry!
Lupin: There are more people than just you and –
Sirius: It doesn’t matter to anyone important!
Lupin: *tried to shush him*
Sirius: I didn’t escape from bloody Azkaban just so you could shut me out with your bloody werewolf complex!"
17,13792248,Sirius,Lupin,"Sirius: It doesn’t matter to anyone important! I didn’t escape from bloody Azkaban just so you could shut me out with your bloody werewolf complex! *waves his hand as he spoke, making angry, red zigzags with the cigarette* I love you. And we can make this work. I don’t want to be apart from you anymore.
Lupin: I love you, too, Sirius. You know that, but –
Sirius: *kisses Lupin*
Lupin: *kisses back, seems to sway into Sirius, and his hand came up to grab Sirius by the upper arm*

Harry: Does Sirius always run off when he’s angry?
Lupin: Sirius isn’t angry.
Harry: Only, he seemed pretty angry last night when I heard you two arguing.
Lupin: I told him not to shout.
Harry: It wasn’t him shouting. I came down for a glass of water, and I overheard you.
Lupin: Oh.
Harry: You could have asked me. You both could have asked me. Cuz Sirius is right. I do love it here. I want to stay here. And if you and Sirius are… happy together, I don’t want to be why you have to be separated.
Lupin: It’s not that simple, Harry.
Harry: Do you want us to stay?
Lupin: Of course I do, Harry. More than anything.
Harry: Then why can’t we?
Lupin: It’s funny. I was so scared of what your father would think when he found out Sirius and I were together. Which was rather silly, I know. He’d taken in stride the fact that I was a werewolf. But…
Harry: But what?
Lupin: But I suppose I’ve never managed to stop living in fear. It should stop surprising me how much you’re like your parents, Harry.
Harry: Do you think Sirius was right? That they’d want me to live with you and him?
Lupin: Yes."
18,13792248,Lupin,Harry,"Lupin: “It should stop surprising me how much you’re like your parents, Harry.”
Harry: “Do you think Sirius was right? That they’d want me to live with you and him?”
Lupin: “Yes. Because they’d want me to be happy. And I reckon because they’d want you and Sirius to be happy, too.”
Harry: “All right. I can see I’m outnumbered.”
Lupin: *smiles wistful and bemused, but happy beneath that, definitely happy.*

Lupin: “I want you both to stay. Here. With me.”
Sirius: “You mean it?”
Lupin: “Yes. And you don’t have to hide that you’re together.”
Harry: “And have you? Figured things out?”
Sirius: *looks at Lupin*
Lupin: *looks back at Sirius, takes his hand* “Yes, I think we have.”
Harry: “Welcome home, Sirius. We’re making a roast for dinner.”"
