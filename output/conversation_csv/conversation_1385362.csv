0,1385362,Harry,Draco,"Harry: Is that a yes? *smiles*
Draco: What? *frowns in confusion*
Harry: Sorry, I didn't mean to take -
Draco: No."
1,1385362,Harry,Draco,"Harry: Sorry, I didn’t mean to take –
Draco: No, I mean, nobody’s sitting there, but why would you –
Harry: Oh, brilliant!
Draco: *leans away from Harry warily*
Harry: So, how are you? Merlin, but this summer was a mess. It's good to see you back here, though. How's your mum?
Draco: She's well, thank you."
2,1385362,Harry,Draco,"Harry: Before Harry could respond, McGonagall swept in and the class fell silent. Sparing them all only a glance, she began the lesson.
Harry: Harry sighed in a combination of disappointment and relief. The disappointment was because he hadn’t simply been taking the piss or hiding from the deliriously happy couple his friends made; he really had meant to check in on the lone 'eighth year' Slytherin and try to make friends. Bygones and fresh starts and all that.
Harry: What it really boiled down to was that Harry was just tired of the rivalry. He was 18 and had just finished a long, drawn-out, seven-year war that had been a frustrating combination of Hurry-Up-and-Wait and Oh-My-God-We’re-Going-to-Die. He was tired of constantly watching his back. He was tired of being in a never ending one-up contest. He was tired of matching glare for glare and scathing remark for scathing remark.
Harry: He suspected Draco was as well.
Harry: Since returning to Hogwarts two weeks prior, Draco didn't seem to be talking to anyone. He kept his head down, slipped through side corridors to avoid the crowds, and generally behaved like a kicked puppy. Given his added height, he wasn’t succeeding very well at remaining under the radar, and it only served to make Harry ache in sympathy at the sight. While Harry couldn’t necessarily say he was actively fond of the prat, they had six years of mutual antagonism under their belts, so he liked to think he knew Draco quite well.
Harry: He even had the repository to prove it. This repository was spread across old homework assignments, napkins, books, the inside edge of one of his pillowcases, and all over his brain.
Harry: And now, Harry’s Draco Lucius Abraxas Malfoy Repository of Information Collected Whilst Stalking (DLAMRoICWS) was facing a glaring discrepancy between the contents of that repository and the young man beside him and blaring a code red.
Harry: He also thought they could really use each other at this point. Draco really needed to get out more and have a friend, and Harry needed someone who simply Got It. Got the war, got the desire to hide from the well-meaning crowds, got the fact that he was more a boy than a hero and didn’t give a damn about his fame. Got, even, that Hermione and Ron were a bit much, and going from a trio to one was not a pleasant experience.
Harry: Even if their mutual understanding had come about through years of hostility, it was still there now – and hopefully the antagonism wouldn’t be.
Harry: None of these thoughts were new.
Harry: Well, they were new in the grand scheme of things, perhaps, but he’d thought them through all summer as he read article after article on how the Malfoys were faring after the war. Taking in the quiet comments from the young heir and how resigned he looked in his photos, Harry obsessed"
3,1385362,Harry,Draco,"Harry: Lovely night for a picnic. Sorry about that. I thought you’d heard me come in.
Draco: People come and go. I didn’t expect anyone to approach me, much less you.
Harry: Well, I didn’t exactly expect you, either. But there you are, and here I am, and the elves were a bit over-eager in packing. Help a bloke out?
Draco: If you’re trying to poison me, there are more elegant ways to do it than some ridiculous picnic scheme.
Harry: I’d probably end up blessing you instead, or poisoning myself on the fumes. You know how I am at brewing. Go on, then – I nearly tore my arm off carrying this thing. We may as well enjoy it.
Draco: Why are you even out here? Shouldn’t you be celebrating with your minions?
Harry: They’re not minions. Well, not most of them, anyway. I suppose a few of them have been acting a bit minionly, but I’m hoping it’ll pass in a few weeks if I ignore it. It’s pretty awkward to go to brush my teeth and have Seamus hand me my toothbrush, or come back to Neville fluffing my pillow.
Draco: *gave him a look that clearly said he thought Harry was exaggerating*
Draco: *sighed and reached into the basket* That wasn’t a very smooth def..."
4,1385362,Draco,Potter,"Draco: That wasn’t a very smooth deflection, Potter.
Harry: Wasn’t it? Maybe I just wanted fresh air.
Draco: We’re inside a greenhouse.
Harry: So I got the fresh air on the way to the greenhouse, and am ready to be indoors again.
Draco: Hey, wait – I’m sorry?
Draco: What exactly are you trying to do? Why are you sitting next to me, why are you calling me by name, why are you out here?
Harry: It’s not anything to do with you, really. I just… it’s all noise in there. Too many people, too much staring. Hermione and Ron have been all over each other since the summer –
Draco: Just stop babbling at me. You sound like an idiot.
Harry: *grins*

Harry: Hey, Draco. Taking up a new hobby?
Draco: A hob– what?
Harry: A hob– what?
Draco: A hob– what?
Harry: A hob– what?
Draco: A hob– what?"
5,1385362,Harry,Draco,"Harry: “A hob– what?”
Draco: “What’s that, a law text? Are you planning to join the Ministry?”
Harry: “I didn’t know you liked to read!”
Draco: “No, find your own copy.”
Harry: “Come on, tell me about it! It can’t be that boring if you’re reading it in your free time.”
Draco: “It wouldn’t interest you.”
Harry: “Because I don’t think mad, self-destructive, Russian murderers are really your type, even if you may share a sometimes similar sense of self-righteous arrogance.”
Harry: “Merlin. Are you sure you’re not meant to be friends with ‘Mione? Because really, both your ideas of recreational reading are a little… intense.”
Draco: “What are you doing here?”
Harry: “Ah, no. I mean, I know the basics of how to cook in a Muggle kitchen, but it’s not something I’d call a hobby. I was just…”
Harry: “I was looking for somewhere to hide for a bit.”
Harry: “Maybe, but it’s still more fun.”"
6,1385362,Harry,Draco,"Harry: Doesn’t nattering at me defeat the purpose of hiding?
Draco: *gives Harry a look*
Harry: Maybe, but it’s still more fun.
Draco: *rolls his eyes*
Harry: I can deal with maybe one or two people I actually personally know. But Ron and Hermione are busy, so…
Draco: Forgive me for not actually caring.
Harry: I’m not asking you to care. I told you – it’s a relief. It’s pretty liberating.
Draco: *rolls his eyes again*
Harry: If I shut up while we’re in the library, will you please just accept my words at face value? If I say I don’t expect you to care, I don’t expect you to care. Only I don’t want kids I barely know coming up to me when I’m alone and making awkward small talk. And I don’t think you really want kids you barely know standing close to you and making passive-aggressive comments, either.
Draco: *relents after staring suspiciously at Harry*
Draco: Fine. I don’t entirely believe you, and I don’t know why you’re being so damn persistent about this, but if it keeps you from being such a bother, do as you please. Just do it quietly.
Harry: *a bit worried but relieved* A bit worried about the clear weariness in the other boy but relieved nonetheless, Harry nodded, settled back in his chair, and picked up his book again.
Harry: Good night, Draco.
Draco: *gives Harry a strange look but doesn't argue or tell him to stop*
Harry: *considers it as permission to continue* Operation Make Friends with Draco Malfoy was well under way.
Draco: What in Merlin’s name is around your neck, Potter?
Harry: I’m pretty sure they were called scarves the last I checked.
Draco: And did you kill it yourself?
Harry: I dunno. It’s the only one I’ve got besides my house scarf."
7,1385362,Draco,Harry,"Draco: Exactly how far are you planning to follow me? *frowns at Harry*
Harry: Grinning, Harry shrugged one shoulder. “What makes you think I have a plan?” he asked.
Draco: You’ve had a plan of some sort since you started pestering me. You’re not exactly subtle.
Harry: What? I can be subtle! I can! We had to sneak around all the time last year!
Draco: Yes, and you’re excellent at sneaking around the castle, too. But when I can actually see you, you’re not subtle.
Harry: Nobody else notices. Hermione, for one, would have said something.
Draco: She hasn’t had as much reason to look for signs that you’re tricking her, has she?
Harry: Just want to be friends?
Draco: – just want to be friends. *stares at Harry in disgruntled disbelief*
Harry: You do that, and let me know when you do, yeah? So I know what I’m supposedly up to?
Draco: *wordlessly turns a page in his Ancient Runes text*
Harry: He could be patient. He’d out-stubborned him at the library several times.
Draco: *smothers Harry with a pillow*
Harry: *flailing and choking* The apparently homicidal Slytherin stared down at him with wide, startled eyes."
8,1385362,Draco,Harry,"Draco: Were you ever planning to go away, or have you moved in now?
Harry: You couldn’t just say ‘Wake up’ or something like a normal person?
Draco: I’ve been trying to get you up for nearly ten minutes, Potter. You sleep like the damn dead.
Harry: Four hours?
Harry: It’s not even worth going back.
Draco: Yes, it is, because you’re hogging my bed. Get moving.
Harry: But the corridors are cold.
Draco: You’ve got a robe.
Harry: A robe doesn’t stop the draughts!
Draco: Any other complaints?
Harry: It’ll do.
Harry: Bidding Draco good night, he headed back to Gryffindor tower.
//
Harry: What is?
Hermione: You know perfectly well what I’m talking about, Harry. You’ve got that look in your eye, and your mouth is twitching.
Harry: And besides, aside from questioning your tastes, I don’t really care that you’re dating Malfoy.
Harry: Now, wait a minute! I’m not –
Hermione: I can’t say I’m surprised, really. We all heard your testimony at the trials, and that was still nothing compared to the way you used to stalk him.
Harry: I didn’t – I had good reason to –
Hermione: And even I can admit that he’s much more tolerable these days, now that he’s not spouting all that blood purity rubbish.
Harry: Well, yes, but I don’t see how that has –
Hermione: But don’t you think he deserves a little more honesty?
Harry: Honesty? About what?
Hermione: Harry. You’ve got the poor boy carrying your books around school.
Harry: I hurt my shoulder in Transfigurations!
Hermione: You’ve been wearing his scarf like a brand.
Harry: It’s a nice scarf!
Harry: You rarely sleep in your own room anymore.
Harry: Have you seen the beds in the dungeon?"
9,1385362,Harry,Draco,"Harry: Stop deflecting and spit it out, Potter.
Draco: That's what you're - oh, for Salazar's sake. No, you pillock, you have a mouth twitch. You get the look in your eye first, and the mouth twitch starts just before you say something you think is sneaky.
Harry: Since when?
Draco: Since, I don't know, third year? Fourth? Birth?
Harry: Of course it matters! Nobody's ever mentioned anything like that before, and even if Snape used to stare at me suspiciously, he stared at everyone suspiciously, so it didn't exactly mean anything. And now you suddenly say I have these facial tells I never knew about! I'd think you were having me on, since you weren't behaving the way you normally do when carrying out Fact #299, except Hermione confirmed it today, and I just -
Draco: Wait. Wait, wait, wait. Did you just say 'Fact #299'?
Harry: Er...
Draco: You did. You only freeze up like that when you're embarrassed, and since scenarios A and C are irrelevant, it must be scenario B.
Harry: Scenario B?
Draco: Why are you numbering facts about me?
Harry: Why are you lettering scenarios about me?
Draco: What's 'Fact #299'?
Harry: What are scenarios A, B, and C?
Draco: There are lots of scenarios A, B, and C for different behavioral patterns.
Harry: And now you're deflecting!
Draco: Well, there are!
Harry: There are a lot of facts, too!
Harry: Not as important, I think, as Fact... I suppose it will be Fact #500.
Harry: What is it?
Draco: I... I believe I'm misinterpreting the current situation.
Harry: What is there to misinterpret? I'm pretty sure we're on the same page here.
Draco: You're a hero, Harry.
Harry: And I'm a criminal."
10,1385362,Harry,Draco,"Harry: And I’m a criminal.
Harry: Now, wait a minute. You are not! You were pardoned!
Draco: You were pardoned because you were a minor, and you were coerced with no way out!
Harry: You still deserve better. You deserve someone who never would have wavered in the first place, someone good and brave.
Harry: At age eleven, you saw a shadow in the Forbidden Forest and ran off without me; this year, you stayed in Fiendfyre to try and save your unconscious friend. At age thirteen, you refused to bow down to an enormous hippogriff; this year, you’re humbling yourself to me. At age sixteen –
Harry: At age sixteen, I nearly killed you while you were desperate and depressed. I watched you bleeding out, and I ran. I never even apologized for it. But this year, you lied to your father’s face to save my life. What could possibly be better and braver than that?
Draco: I’ve never apologized to you, either. Not for anything I’ve said and done to you over the years.
Harry: Okay.
Draco: ‘Okay’?
Harry: Okay.
Harry: Accepted. And for the record… I’m sorry, too. For being a prat right back… for the things I said or did that got you in trouble, too… for taking your wand.
Draco: Taking my wand kept the Elder Wand away from the Dark Lord. You don’t have to apologize for that.
Harry: Taking your wand left you helpless to protect yourself during a war. You’re the one who had Voldemort and the Death Eaters actually in your home.
Harry: Someone’s always trying to kill me; I’m pretty used to that.
Draco: That’s not the point.
Harry: And neither is this entire argument! We’ve got a long history of fighting. I know that. We’re probably always going to fight. We bicker when we’re getting along, for Godric’s sake. And we’re going to have some long, bad talks about the war, too. But that’ll happen no matter what so long..."
11,1385362,Harry,Draco,"Harry: That’s not the point.”“And neither is this entire argument!”
Harry: We’ve got a long history of fighting. I know that. We’re probably always going to fight. We bicker when we’re getting along, for Godric’s sake. And we’re going to have some long, bad talks about the war, too. But that’ll happen no matter what so long as we stay in touch, I think. Which, you know, I’d really like to do. The point is – ”
Harry: And here, his Gryffindor courage hiccupped again.Fidgeting uncomfortably, he cleared his throat. He shuffled his feet. He rubbed his neck. He avoided Draco’s eyes to stare roughly at his throat.
Draco: Yes,” he stated firmly, “I like you.
Harry: Oh,” Harry replied, slightly dazed from both the kiss and his sheer disbelief that this was actually happening. “Okay. Good. I, uh… I mean, I like you. Too. I like you, too. A lot. Yeah.
Draco: If you want.
Harry: I want.
Harry: Wait, so then – so we… we’re…?
Draco: If you want.
Harry: I want.
Harry: Then yeah. Yeah, ‘we’re’. Whatever you want."
