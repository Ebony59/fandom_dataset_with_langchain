0,14041068,Ron,Hermione,"Ron: BUT WHY SHOULD I KNOW WHAT’S GOING ON? WHY SHOULD ANYONE BOTHER TO TELL ME WHAT’S BEEN HAPPENING?
Hermione: Harry, we wanted to tell you, we really did—
Harry: CAN’T’VE WANTED TO THAT MUCH, CAN YOU, OR YOU’D HAVE SENT ME AN OWL, BUT DUMBLEDORE MADE YOU SWEAR—
Hermione: Well, he did—
Harry: FOUR WEEKS I’VE BEEN STUCK IN PRIVET DRIVE, NICKING PAPERS OUT OF THE BINS TO TRY AND FIND OUT WHAT’S BEEN GOING ON—
Hermione: *drops to her knees and starts sobbing uncontrollably*
Harry: *wide-eyed* Er, Hermione?
Hermione: Harry, we wanted to tell you, but I said we should talk to Dumbledore about it and get permission first, so…We tried, Harry. We really did. But we couldn’t even talk to him most of the time, let alone try to convince him. Even when we saw Dumbledore, he barely gave us the time of day. We begged him to do something—to get you out of there or to let us tell you something. But he said it would be safest if you stayed at your relatives’ house, and if we didn’t tell you anything. We asked him why, but he didn’t answer. We told him you’d get restless and do something stupid, but he wouldn’t listen. I was furious, and I knew you’d be even more furious, but I still believed him. I believed he was right that you’d be safer that way because he’s Dumbledore, and then…AND THEN YOU TOLD US YOU WERE ATTACKED BY BLOODY DEMENTORS, AND YOU MIGHT BE EXPELLED! I was so scared I might never see you again, Harry, and it’s all my fault! I should have just ignored Dumbledore from the start! I should’ve written you more or…or…”
Harry: *crouching down beside her and awkwardly patting her on the shoulder* I—I’m sorry, Hermione, I didn’t know."
1,14041068,Harry,Hermione,"Harry: I want to talk to you more or... or... *crouching down beside her and awkwardly patting her on the shoulder* I—I'm sorry, Hermione, I didn't know.
Hermione: I'm such a horrible friend.
Harry: No, I... I don't think that. *stammered* I mean, look at everything you've done for me. I was just so mad about not hearing anything. I mean, I'm the one Voldemort's trying to kill. I'm the one in the middle of all this. Shouldn't I know what's going on?
Hermione: Of course you should Harry. That's what we said. I don't know what Dumbledore was thinking. And I just took his word as gospel and ruined everything...! Am I too trusting, Harry?
Harry: Um... kinda, yeah, *admitted uncomfortably* but still, Dumbledore's usually been trying to help me. I don't know what he was thinking, either.
Ron: Mind you, Mum's been pretty keen on keeping us out of the loop, too. Says we're too young and all that crud.
Harry: Oh, your mum's here, too? *helping Hermione up* Where is here, anyway?
Ron: Headquarters of the Order of the Phoenix.
Harry: Should that mean something to me?
Ron: Well, no, I guess it wouldn't. It's like a secret society.
Hermione: Dumbledore started it. They fought against You-Know-Who last time.
Harry: Alright, what're they doing, then? And what's Voldemort up to, for that matter?
Ron: We don't know much. They don't let us in the meetings. Fred and George invented these Extendable Ears to listen in, but Mum went berserk when she found out.
Hermione: They've got Order members following known Death Eaters. And some working on recruiting. And they're guarding something, too.
Harry: That was me, according to Mrs. Figg.
Fred: Stop doing that!
Hermione: Better be careful, Fred. She's got a temper, that one.
Fred: So I heard. Hullo, Harry, we thought we recognised your dulcet tones. Hermione here was a bit of a surprise, though. She's got a real set of pipes on her.
Harry: Hey, give her a break, guys. She was really freaking out.
Hermione: Ha. I was freaking out? I'm not the one who got attacked by d-dementors in broad daylight.
Harry: I'm fine, Hermione, really. I mean, it was bloody close, but that was mostly because—erk!
Hermione: Harry, you need to stop almost getting killed. I don't know what I'd do if I lost you.
Ginny: Oh, hi, Harry. Am I interrupting something?
Harry: *blushing heavily*"
2,14041068,Harry,Ginny,"Harry: I don’t know what I’d do if I lost you.
Ginny: Oh, hi, Harry. Am I interrupting something?
Harry: *flinched back from Hermione and blushed heavily*
Ginny: Don’t bother with the Extendable Ears. Mum put an Imperturbable Charm on the door.
Fred: Dang, we wanted to find out what old Snape was up to.
George: Snape’s here? Yeah, giving a report. Top secret.
Harry: Oh, that’s right. He was a spy in the last war, wasn’t he?
Hermione: Yes. He started back up right away. There are always a lot of people coming through here for the order—Sirius and Remus, of course. McGonagall, Moody, some Aurors. Mr. and Mrs. Weasley. Bill and Charlie…
Harry: And Percy?
Ron: Percy said the only evidence You-Know-Who is back is your word, and…well…
Hermione: Your word doesn’t carry as far as it ought to. Not with what people are saying about you.
Harry: What are people saying about me?
Hermione: Haven’t you been reading the Daily Prophet?
Harry: I thought I was, but I never saw anything about me or Voldemort. Is Dumbledore messing with that, too?
Hermione: No! I’m sure he’s not, Harry. It’s just that it’s subtle. They…they crack a joke about you once or twice a week. They act like you’re…well, delusional and attention-seeking is the only way I can put it. Like if something weird happens, they’ll call it ‘a tale worthy of Harry Potter.’ You kind of have to read between the lines, but they want people to get the impression that you’re hooked on being famous, and you’ll say anything to get attention.
Harry: That’s insane! Voldemort killed my parents! How can they think that I—
Hermione: Harry, please calm down. We know none of that drivel about you is true. But you can’t do anything about the rest of it—not yet—not with the Ministry out to get you like this. They don’t have a case to expel you. They don’t even have the right to expel you, but the fact that they’re trying—
Harry: And the fact that I got attacked by dementors? Did they mention that?
Hermione: Of course not. That’s a straight cover-up. They’d never admit to losing control of the dementors—or worse. The fear of losing control of them is what got them removed in third year after they tried to Kiss us, even though Sirius was supposedly still on the loose. But you need to get through this hearing first. They’re going to try to railroad you. I just know it. You need to try to stay on their good side. If there are enough law-abiding people in the DMLE, they should put a stop to it, then.
Harry: *stewed, but didn’t say anything more*
Mrs. Weasley: The meeting is over. Come along to dinner. Everyone’s dying to see you, Harry, we’ve been so worried.
Harry: *lingered back with Hermione*"
3,14041068,Hermione,Harry,"Hermione: Harry, I am so sorry about not writing to you, but I’m here for you, now. Any help you need with the hearing, I’m there. I’ve already got some law books from Sirius’s library.
Harry: Thanks. It sounds like I’m gonna need it.

Mrs. Weasley: Dumbledore says we shouldn’t tell Harry more than he needs to know.
Sirius: I’m not telling him more than he needs to know, Molly. But considering he’s survived more tangles with Voldemort than any of us besides Dumbledore, he has a right to know.

Ginny: Ron hadn’t included her in that statement, even though they’d tell her too.
Ron: *gets a taste of Ginny’s wrath when she “accidentally” brought her heel down hard on his foot on the way out of the kitchen, with the promise of more to come.*

Remus: *acting as the voice of reason in all this, agreed with Mrs. Weasley*

Mrs. Weasley: *sent them all off to bed, not even letting them talk to each other, not that that stopped them.*"
4,14041068,Sirius,Harry,"Sirius: I used to be on it. Down there. *points to a large cigarette burn near the bottom* Mother dearest blasted me off the tapestry when I ran away from home.
Harry: You ran away from home?
Sirius: Yeah, when I was sixteen. I’d had enough. I hated my parents and everything they stood for, and I didn’t want to wind up like my brother, believing every word of it.
Harry: Where did you go?
Sirius: Your dad’s place. Your grandparents were really good about it. Didn’t like my parents any more than I did.
Harry: Wow.
Sirius: Yeah, it’s not as majestic as you’d think, is it? You know what the dirty secret of the old pureblood families is, Harry?
Harry: What?
Sirius: We’re not really pureblooded. Families like mine? They disown any family member who doesn’t do what they’re told. Pretend they don’t exist. Me? I left because I didn’t agree with them or their ideas. *points to another nearby burn mark* Uncle Alphard? He was a Black in good standing…until he left me a fair bit of money in his will. Cousin Andromeda was over there. *points to a burn mark between Bellatrix Lestrange and Narcissa Malfoy* She’s Tonks’s mother. She was disowned for marrying a muggle-born. Great Uncle Marius was a squib, but it wouldn’t surprise me if he has kids or grandkids who are magical. And suddenly, there are Blacks running around who aren’t so pureblooded anymore, and all Mum and Dad could do was just ignore them. Phineas Black supported muggle rights. Cedrella Black married a pureblood, but his surname was Weasley—Arthur’s parents. Go back all these generations, and I bet I have more relatives who’ve been written out of the family than are still in it.
Harry: *stares at the tapestry in surprise*
Sirius: What happened to Regulus?
Harry: Stupid idiot. He joined the Death Eaters.
Sirius: You’re kidding!
Harry: Nope. He bought into it. All of it. And then—I’m guessing—he got cold feet when it came time to actually get his hands dirty. Tried to leave. I bet you can guess how Voldemort deals with people like him.
Harry: *doesn’t have to guess*"
5,14041068,Harry,Hermione,"Harry: Hermione, school hasn’t started yet, and I know you’ve got your homework done by now. What are you so busy with?
Hermione: Huh? Oh, your hearing, Harry. I wanted to do more...
Harry: I think you’ve done all you can. You must have read every law book in the house by now.
Hermione: I know, but I’m still worried. The Ministry’s not supposed to be able to expel you. It was textbook self-defence. But they might do it anyway. I wanted to find some other contingency, so I…
Harry: Hermione, what did you do?
Hermione: I’m sorry. I should have talked to you sooner. I know I need to be better at actually telling you things, but I didn’t want to get your hopes up until I had something to show for it. I didn’t commit you to anything, please understand. I just wanted to find out what the options were—
Harry: Hermione, what are you talking about?
Hermione: Harry, if you could leave Hogwarts and go someplace people would actually treat you decently, would you?
Harry: ...What?
Hermione: I know how much you love Hogwarts, but be honest: it’s been a mixed bag for you. Near-death experiences on a regular basis, the student body turning on you at the drop of a hat, unhelpful teachers…Snape…And now the Ministry’s trying to silence you. Do you ever wonder if it’s not worth it anymore?
Harry: *jaw hit the floor* Okay, who are you, and what have you done with Hermione?
Hermione: Harry! I didn’t mean dropping out! I meant switching schools.
Harry: *lowers his wand* Switching schools?
Hermione: Yes. Listen, I looked into it, and there’s only so much they can do at your hearing. They can snap your wand, sure, and they can ban you from carrying a new one so you couldn’t well go back to Hogwarts, but they can’t ban you from the magical world or prevent you from travelling overseas or anything like that. So I thought, if it all falls apart at your hearing..."
6,14041068,Harry,Hermione,"Harry: Switching schools?
Hermione: Yes. Listen, I looked into it, and there’s only so much they can do at your hearing. They can snap your wand, sure, and they can ban you from carrying a new one so you couldn’t well go back to Hogwarts, but they can’t ban you from the magical world or prevent you from travelling overseas or anything like that. So I thought, if it all falls apart at your hearing, maybe you could go to some other magical school. If we could find a place that will actually give you a fair hearing, they could revoke your wand ban and let you attend there.
Harry: Hermione, you’re brilliant. Absolutely brilliant. You really think they’d take me?
Hermione: Honestly, you’re Harry Potter. Your name may be mud in Britain right now, but you’re famous enough in other countries, and you’re an up-and-coming Quidditch star, too. That’s enough for a lot of people to be willing to give you a chance.
Harry: Seriously? Wow. Okay, so all we need to do is write to the heads of some other schools and ask if they’ll take me?
Hermione: Actually…I’ve already sent the letters.
Harry: Of course you have, Hermione. How many letters?
Hermione: Eight. Unfortunately, there are only eleven well-recognised schools of magic in the world. Durmstrang doesn’t accept muggle-borns, and the Japanese school doesn’t take non-native students, so that leaves us with eight.
Harry: And…?
Hermione: Uagadou School of Magic in Uganda is interested.
Harry: Thank you, Hermione. I’m sorry I yelled at you so much before.
Hermione: Don’t be, Harry. I deserved it for how I treated you. I did this to try to make it up to you.
Harry: You did more than that. This is the best news I’ve gotten since I got here… Wait, what about Sirius?
Hermione: What about him?
Harry: Well, I don’t want to leave him behind. If we can find a country that’ll give me a fair shake, do you think we’d be able to do the same for him?
Hermione: Political asylum. Harry, you’re a genius!
Harry: That’s…that would be…do you you really think that would work?"
7,14041068,Harry,Hermione,"Harry: That's...that would be...do you really think that would work?
Hermione: We'd have to be careful. First, if we're really serious about Uagadou, we'll need to write to a bunch of the Ministries of Magic in its catchment area, but we'll have to be careful what we say. We can use your name, but we'll have to be vague about Sirius and just say he's an acquaintance of yours who's being denied a fair trial or something like that. The good news is Uagadou serves all of Africa, so it has a lot of countries in its catchment area.
Harry: And if we can find one that'll let Sirius in, he'll be safe?
Hermione: Nothing's completely certain, but if it's anything like the muggle world, there would be a hearing to decide whether to grant him political asylum. It might be a tough sell, since all we really have is our word, but we can offer to use Veritaserum and such. If it succeeds, he'll definitely be safe. If it fails, he'll be extradited back to Britain.
Harry: I don't like that.
Hermione: I know, but it's still probably his best chance. You should at least ask him if he's interested—and he probably will be. You can see how stir-crazy he is here.
Harry: Yeah, I guess. You think it'll work, then?
Hermione: If we find a sympathetic Ministry, I think so. Did you know that most countries don't even use Dementors anymore? A lot of them don't like the British Ministry because of that. I bet there are a few that actually care about justice and want to stick it to them. Hm...I'll have to look them up and draw up a list. Nigeria's probably no good. The new Supreme Mugwump is from there, so he won't be on Dumbledore's side. And the countries on the Mediterranean coast and South Africa wouldn't be my first choice either. Too many close connections with Europe. We can rule out small countries that don't have a strong enough Ministry to stand up to Britain. I mean, they might, but I'd be more comfortable with a bigger one. And we'll want to stay out of conflict zones.
Harry: But how many would that leave us?
Hermione: I'm not sure. Probably still about twenty or so. And we can add some more back in if we need to. I'll draw up the list tonight so we can start writing letters. If we're lucky, Uganda will just take us directly...though I'm not sure what languages they speak there.
Harry: Wait, did you just say us?
Hermione: Well, of course I'll be coming with you. With my grades, I can get into any magical school in the world, and I've got less and less reason to stay here with You-Know-Who running unopposed. To be honest, I had half a mind to tell might my parents let's pack up and move to Australia already—
Harry: Wow, Hermione—
Hermione: —and if the Ministry is so corrupt that they'll go after innocent people, I'm actually kind of scared to stay in this country...Oh God, Harry, I'm just so worried.
Harry: Hermione—
Hermione: What if they try to stop you or Sirius leaving the country? If they break so many of their own laws, there's no telling what they could do. What if they try to take you straight to Azkaban when you show up just to shut you up? What if they try to wipe your memory and expel you from the magical world? Can they even do that? What if they're already secretly working for You-Know-Who? What..."
8,14041068,Harry,Sirius,"Harry: What if they try to stop you or Sirius leaving the country? If they break so many of their own laws, there’s no telling what they could do. What if they try to take you straight to Azkaban when you show up just to shut you up? What if they try to wipe your memory and expel you from the magical world? Can they even do that? What if they’re already secretly working for You-Know-Who? What if—?
Hermione: HERMIONE! Hermione, please calm down.
Harry: *initiated a hug with his bushy-haired friend*
Hermione: Oh, Harry, I’m so sorry. It’s just that I can’t stop. Ever. I try. I really do, but nothing works.
Harry: You’re brilliant, d’you know that? You’re doing fine.
Hermione: You don’t what it’s like. I try to sit still and just not think for a few minutes—you know, kind of like meditation—and I can’t do it. Do you know how hard it is when you try to calm down and relax, and you realise you’re so wound up all the time that you just can’t stop thinking, even for a minute?
Harry: I think that’s who you are, though. You wouldn’t be Hermione Granger otherwise.
Hermione: But I can’t stand it! I wish I could just switch off my brain sometimes…It’s all such rubbish, anyway. There’s no way they can convict you, legally. If there’s anybody sensible watching the proceedings…
Harry: Yeah, I know, but…but maybe it’s better this way.
Hermione: What do you mean?
Harry: I mean you’re right, I don’t have much reason to stay here—not if they’re going to treat me like this and let Voldemort walk all over them. I mean, what good is it if both sides are gonna be fighting me?
Hermione: So then you…want to go?
Harry: I think…I think we need to talk to Sirius…But sticking it to the Ministry and Dumbledore at the same time is starting to sound like a good idea.

Sirius: You really think this will work?
Hermione: Well, now that I’ve found the public trial records from 1981 with you not on them, I think we have a good case. In a similar situation in the muggle world, I’d say it was nearly certain.
Harry: You’ll be okay getting out of the country, right?
Sirius: No trouble there. I did it before, and they were putting in a lot more effort to find me then. Just tell me where and when.
Hermione: As soon as we get an answer, I’ll tell you.
Harry: *anxious waiting*
Hermione: He was in danger in Britain, she reminded him, and just about everybody with real power was out to get him. By his own"
9,14041068,Harry,Sirius,"Harry: I want to talk to him one more time before the hearing to demand answers as to why he was kept in the dark and isolated from his friends all summer.
Sirius: I tried to, pup, but he didn’t stay long, and I couldn’t get away without him or Molly figuring out what I was up to.
Harry: Why did he even come, then?
Sirius: Just to make sure you were ready for the hearing, that the plan to get you to and from the Ministry safely was in place, that kind of thing. Oh, and to warn me that on no account was I to go with you.
Harry: But you’ll be able to get out, won’t you?
Sirius: Oh, I’ll be able to. Don’t worry. I asked Remus to cover for me if there was any trouble. I felt like I was kicking a puppy when I had to tell him, but when I explained everything, he agreed it was for the best. We’re good to go for tomorrow.
Harry: Alright, good to go."
10,14041068,Fudge,Harry,"Fudge: You're late. Your hearing was scheduled for eight o'clock sharp.
Harry: Minister Fudge, I can produce a witness to the fact that the notification of the time change was sent at seven fifty-five. Isn't there some regulation about due diligence that would apply here?
Fudge: Well... be that as it may, you're here now, so let's get started. Take a seat, Mr. Potter.
Harry: *gingerly sits down in the chair*
Fudge: Disciplinary hearing of the twelfth of August into offences committed under the Decree for the Reasonable Restriction of Underage Sorcery and the International Statute of Secrecy by Harry James Potter, resident at number four, Privet Drive, Little Whinging, Surrey.
Harry: *turns his head* Oh, now you show up. I've only wanted to talk to you all summer.
Dumbledore: My apologies, Harry, I was preoccupied. But let us focus on the matter at hand.
Fudge: Ah, Dumbledore. So you got the owl that the time of the hearing had been changed?
Dumbledore: As a matter of fact, no, but by a happy accident, I arrived at the Ministry three hours early.
Fudge: *calls for a second chair for Dumbledore*
Dumbledore: *conjures his own chair*"
11,14041068,Fudge,Potter,"Fudge: Potter of number four, Privet Drive, Little Whinging, Surrey?
Harry: Yes.
Fudge: You received an official warning from the Ministry for using illegal magic three years ago, did you not?
Harry: Yes, but—
Fudge: And you conjured a Patronus on the night of the second of August?
Harry: Wait a minute—
Fudge: Answer the question, Mr. Potter.
Harry: Now hold on! Aren’t I supposed to enter a plea?
Harry: What?
Fudge: Oh, very well, how do you plead?
Harry: Guilty.
Shadowy witch: You see? He admits it!
Elphias Doge: Outrageous! He must be Imperiused! No one would plead guilty to that!
Monocled witch: *raised an eyebrow at Harry*
Dumbledore: Harry, what are you doing? I have witnesses in your defence.
Monocled witch: Yes, I would be interested to know that as well, Mr. Potter. Why would you admit to a charge that could see you losing your wand and your place at Hogwarts without raising so much as an affirmative defence?
Harry: Because, Madam…?
Amelia Bones: Ah. Well, Madam Bones, this hearing is a waste of time. You obviously aren’t going to give me a fair trial. Changing the time and place with five minutes’ notice? Summarily expelling me, which you don’t even have the authority to do, before backtracking and giving me a trial date? You’ve made it pretty clear you don’t want me around—or rather, the Minister has; I assume he’s behind all this. I’m just making this easy for you, Minister.
Madam Bones: Is this true, Cornelius? Those would both be breaches of regulations, and I wonder if I would find any others.
Toad-like witch: The Minister isn’t on trial, Madam Bones. This isn’t relevant to the case.
Madam Bones: It is if it would lead to a mistrial, Madam Umbridge. And even if it doesn’t, you can be sure I will be investigating internally.
Umbridge: We can discuss that at another time then. If Mr. Potter is pleading guilty, then we can move on to sentencing, Minister.
Dumbledore: Minister, I would like to declare Mr. Potter’s plea invalid and enter a plea of not guilty on his behalf.
Harry: And I contest that! I made the decision to plead guilty with careful consideration.
Harry: Do we really need to do this, Professor? It’s not like they’re going to listen to you. They already kicked you out of your Chief Warlock job.
Dumbledore: I would still be remiss in my duties if I did not represent you to the best..."
12,14041068,Harry,Dumbledore,"Harry: “Do we really need to do this, Professor? It’s not like they’re going to listen to you. They already kicked you out of your Chief Warlock job.”
Dumbledore: “I would still be remiss in my duties if I did not represent you to the best of my abilities.”
Harry: “Oh, so now you want to help me?”
Harry: “Hey, Fudge! Can I dismiss Dumbledore for ineffective counsel or something?”
Madam Bones: “Mr. Potter, you haven’t accepted any counsel at all.”
Harry: “Honestly, I don’t see much point, ma’am.”
Fudge: “Well, I don’t see any problem with it if Mr. Potter agrees. Motion sustained. Dumbledore, you are relieved of duty.”
Dumbledore: *looked back and forth between Harry and Fudge with a mixture of betrayal and fear on his face*
Fudge: “And you’re right, Dolores, we can move on to sentencing. Mr. Potter, as per your plea, you are hereby found guilty of violating the Decree for the Reasonable Restriction of Underage Sorcery and the International Statute of Secrecy. Aurors, please relieve Mr. Potter of his wand.”
Harry: “Yes, about that, you actually don’t have the authority to confiscate my wand.”
Fudge: “Excuse me?”
Harry: “According to the ICW Convention on Wand Use of 1692, qualified witches and wizards have a right to carry a wand at all times. The main things that could dis-qualify me are being in prison—and this charge doesn’t carry a prison sentence—or not having a passing O.W.L. mark in Transfiguration, Charms, or Defence while also not being enrolled in any certified magical school.”
Dumbledore: “Ah, and the Wizengamot does not hold the power to expel Hogwarts students. Excellent thinking, Harry.”
Harry: “Thank you, Professor, but I wasn’t talking about that. I’m actually withdrawing from Hogwarts.”
Harry: “Headmaster, if they want to expel me from Hogwarts, I’m sure they’ll find a way to expel me from Hogwarts. As I said, I know I still need to be enrolled in a certified magical school to keep my wand.” He reached into his robes and withdrew two items: a letter and a beautiful piece of polished green mica inscribed with his name. “And I’ve accepted a place at the Uagadou School of Magic in Uganda.”
Elphias Doge: “You really wish to leave the country, Mr. Potter?”
Harry: “I’m sorry, but I don’t see much point in staying, sir.”"
13,14041068,Elphias Doge,Harry,"Elphias Doge: “You really wish to leave the country, Mr. Potter?”
Harry: “I’m sorry, but I don’t see much point in staying, sir.”
Elphias Doge: “And that stone? Is that what I think it is?”
Dumbledore: “Harry, may I see that?”
Harry: *hesitated for a moment*
Dumbledore: “It is a Uagadou Dream Stone,” Dumbledore confirmed. “Harry does have a place there.”
Umbridge: “No! You can’t escape justice that easily, Potter! Aurors, arrest him!”
Harry: “For what?”
Umbridge: “Attempting to flee custody.”
Harry: “I’m not in custody, and you can’t prohibit me from travelling overseas.”
Madam Bones: “Stand down, Auror. Minister, Mr. Potter is correct. If his enrolment at Uagadou is good, then we have no grounds to confiscate his wand.”
Fudge: “If he were sentenced to prison…”
Madam Bones: “But he was also correct there, Madam Umbridge. The charges against him today do not carry a prison sentence.”
Harry: “What sedition, Minister? I haven’t made a public statement all summer.”
Umbridge: “Your statements at the end of the Tournament in June—”
Harry: “Were made under extreme emotional distress and are therefore suspect. Not confirming or denying, of course.”
Dumbledore: “Was officially ruled an accident. Madam Bones, have you reopened that investigation?”
Madam Bones: “No, Dumbledore, I have not.”
Harry: “Then, you don’t have any reason to reopen the investigation, do you?”
Madam Bones: “No, I don’t, Mr. Potter.”
Harry: “Good. Then unless you have something else I’ve done wrong, Minister? That you can prove?”"
14,14041068,Fudge,Harry,"Fudge: “Very well, Mr. Potter,” Fudge announced. “You are hereby fined one thousand galleons, and the Hogwarts Board of Governors will be petitioned for your expulsion unless your official withdrawal is received. Also, I warn you that any further indiscretions may result in charges that we can take your wand for. Other than that…” he grumbled, “you’re free to go.”
Harry: Thank you, Minister, Harry grinned. I won't waste any more of your time.
Harry: By the way, Madam Bones, you might want to look into why there were dementors running around in Little Whinging.
Mr. Weasley: Harry, what happened in there? he asked. I heard a lot of shouting.
Harry: Mr. Weasley, he said, the outcome of that hearing was a foregone conclusion from the start. I just had to make sure it would still work out for me.
Mr. Weasley: Harry, what do you mean?
Harry: I'm leaving, Mr. Weasley. He produced the letter from Uagadou. You and your family have been really good to me the past four years, but if I want to get a good education and actually learn to defend myself properly—if I'm going to stay safe—it's not going to be here—at least not as long as Fudge is around.
Mr. Weasley: Harry, I had no idea things were going that badly for you. We could have found another way.
Harry: I'm sure you would have done your best, but there's more to it than that. I have other reasons that I can't tell you yet. I promise you'll find out in the next couple weeks, but for now, I can't say anything where people might overhear it.
Mr. Weasley: Well, then…I can respect your decision Harry, Mr. Weasley said. I must say I'm very surprised. And the children will be very disappointed. May I ask where this is coming from? This isn't something I would have expected from you.
Harry: Actually, it was Hermione's idea. She's going, too.
Dumbledore: Harry, come quickly, he ordered.
Harry: Why? Harry said.
Dumbledore: Because the Minister may yet try to move against you.
Mr. Weasley: Dumbledore, Harry says he's leaving Britain, Mr. Weasley said.
Dumbledore: So it would seem, he replied. We must talk, Harry, and it is not safe to do so here.
Harry: Well, okay, but I have to meet Hermione's parents at lunchtime, Harry said cautiously.
Dumbledore: Why? he said.
Harry: To go to the airport.
Mr. Weasley: You're leaving by aeroplane?
Dumbledore: We will discuss this, Harry. For now, we will go to Hogwarts."
15,14041068,Mr. Weasley,Dumbledore,"Mr. Weasley: The airport?
Dumbledore: We will discuss this, Harry. For now, we will go to Hogwarts.
Dumbledore: Harry, why do you feel the need to leave Britain?
Harry: I thought I made my point pretty clear, Professor. The Ministry’s out for my blood. They want me out of the way, one way or another. If it wasn’t the hearing today, it would have been something else. Meanwhile, Voldemort wants to kill me, and the Ministry isn’t doing anything to stop him.
Harry: I was attacked by dementors in broad daylight in a muggle neighbourhood. Nice job. Do you even know how they got there?
Dumbledore: Alas, no. I suspect a Death Eater sympathiser within the Ministry, but I can no longer leverage my position to find a trail.
Harry: Then you really aren’t in a position to protect me, are you?
Dumbledore: Harry, fleeing the country will not stop Voldemort from pursuing you.
Harry: Yeah, I figured as much, but since nobody around here seems to be doing anything, it can’t hurt to put some distance between me and him, can it?
Harry: Safer at Hogwarts? I doubt it. The way I understand it, the entire city of Uagadou is protected like Hogwarts is and then some. Voldemort would have to fight an entire Auror force to get in there. Besides, Hogwarts hasn’t been all that safe for me the past four years…has it, Professor?
Mr. Weasley: I know a lot of things have gone wrong at Hogwarts over the past few years. Believe me, Molly and I have had fits about what’s happened to Ron and Ginny, and you’ve had it even worse. But the fact remains that Hogwarts is the safest place in the wizarding world.
Harry: No. The safest place in Britain, maybe, but the world’s a lot bigger than just Britain, Mr. Weasley. Everyone seems to forget that, but Hermione’s done her homework. Uagadou has been threatened by seven dark lords in the past fifty years alone and repulsed all of them easily.
Mr. Weasley: That doesn’t exactly sound safe.
Harry: Compared with Voldemort or his servants successfully breaking into Hogwarts four years in a row and nearly killing me every time?
Dumbledore: You do not realise the consequences of your actions, Harry.
Harry: I doubt that. This was Hermione’s idea. You know she’ll have thought of everything. Or, if you’re referring to leaving Britain less protected without its ‘Saviour’, it’s the Ministry’s that’s doing that.
Dumbledore: Harry, I’m afraid I can’t allow you to leave.
Harry: Actually, Professor, as I’m no longer a student here, you don’t have the legal authority to keep me here.
Mr. Weasley: How did you convince them to sign something for you? For that"
16,14041068,Harry,Hermione,"Harry: “I wasn’t talking about Sirius. Look.” *holds up a piece of paper* “Letter signed by my aunt and uncle saying I’m free to switch schools and leave the country with Hermione’s family as long as I don’t ever darken their doorstep again.”
Mr. Weasley: “How did you convince them to sign something for you?” he asked. “For that matter, when did you?
Harry: “Hermione’s parents are well-off and work in a respected muggle profession,” Harry explained. “The Dursleys would listen to them any day of the week.”
Dumbledore: “But the wards, Harry,” Dumbledore said. “Your presence is required to maintain them. Your relatives will not be protected.”
Harry: “You can set up new wards there, can’t you? Besides, if I publicly make a break with them and leave the country, there won’t be much reason to go after them, will there? And I am making this as public as possible. All of it.”
Dumbledore: *doesn’t seem to have anything to say to that.*
Harry: “Is that all, Professor?” Harry said. “Because I’d very much like to pack up to leave.”
Dumbledore: “And you believe you will be able to travel to Africa by muggle aeroplane without trouble?” Dumbledore asked.
Harry: “We’ve got it in hand,” Harry said.
Mr. Weasley: “I’ll make sure he gets there safely, Dumbledore,” Mr. Weasley added. “And You-Know-Who is smart enough not to attack a muggle transit hub…Harry’s right, you know. You can’t keep the lad here if he doesn’t want to stay.”
Dumbledore: *looks between the two of them and bows his head* “Unfortunately, I fear you are right, Arthur. If I cannot change your mind, Harry, I will convey you back to Grimmauld Place. I would be remiss if I did not continue to protect you until you go.”
Harry: “Thank you, Professor.”
Ron: “So, how’d it go?” Ron broke the silence.
Harry: “Exactly as planned,” he said. “Fudge won’t be bothering me anymore.”
The Weasleys: *stunned* That clearly wasn’t the result they were expecting. Getting him off, sure, but getting Fudge off his back entirely? That wasn’t even on their radar. “Say what, now?” Ron said.
Harry: *turns and locks eyes with Hermione* “Hermione, I said it before, but you’re brilliant,” he said. “Your plan worked perfectly. All I had to do was know my rights and tell them to shove it, and they folded.”
The Weasleys: *confused* “What?” the Weasleys said in confusion.
Hermione: “Harry, that’s wonderful!” Hermione squealed. She ran to his side, hugged him tight, and kissed him on the cheek, as she had done last spring. But then, on impulse, Harry turned his head and pecked her on the lips."
