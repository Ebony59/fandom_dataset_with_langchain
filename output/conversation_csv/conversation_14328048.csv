0,14328048,James,Reggie,"James: Reggie, please, we need to speak to him. You can't let your brother know either. *cornered Reggie in the Ministry's Atrium and pulled him into a corner and put up a privacy charm.*
Reggie: James, I am not sure he will want to see you. All I can do is tell him. I will let you know about his decision. I am going to ask you flat out, are you sure about this? I would have never thought you would even want to be in the same room as him without throwing curses at each other, much less speak to him.
James: Please, Reggie. It's a matter of life and death. *thought. His and Lily's life to be exact.*
Reggie: Fine, I will..."

James: Please, Reggie. It's a matter of life and death.
Reggie: Fine, I will let you know.

Reggie: Come this way.
Reggie: Dismissed Reggie.

James: We asked to speak to you because of the prophecy. Albus came to us, warned us about this prophecy, and put us at his house in Godric's Hollow.
James: Albus tested each of the boys. Neville is almost a squib so it's not him. Albus also said that it was about a couple who defied you three times. Frank has but Alice has never encountered you whereas Lily and I have.
James: No, but I did touch the orb in the Hall of Prophecies. I wanted to listen to it, however, I would have to break it to know it and I was afraid if I did, Albus would find out."

3,14328048,Severus,Harry,"Severus: My Lord, I have the potion.
Harry: Hi.
Severus: Very well, I only got a few hours of sleep before I was woken up by this one. They were celebrating last night.
Harry: She did it."
4,14328048,Bellatrix,Narcissa,"Bellatrix: Very well, I only got a few hours of sleep before I was woken up by this one. They were celebrating last night.
Narcissa: I see the blame someone else stage my Lord.
Annie: No, it was Nagini's idea. Harry needed to be changed. He needs nappies still. We already spoke to him about Draco. He was very excited to get a brother.
Marvolo: I believe since we dine together regularly, it would be good to use my name Marvolo.
Narcissa: I will bring some parenting books.
Severus: Dumbledore called a meeting to be held later. He left it a message for me last night so it's not about them.
Severus: Yes, and I thought about what you asked, I agree.
Ironclaw: You are here to witness the blood adoption of Harrison James Potter-Black.
Reggie: My Lord, I would like to add my blood to the ritual. It will keep Sirius from getting the Lordship, especially when I inform our parents.
Bellatrix: I would also like to add my own blood. He is family.
Narcissa: *exchanged a quick look with Bellatrix, knowing they were going to mother Harry, the child was going to have a lot of parents in his life.*"
5,14328048,Ironclaw,Dark Lord,"Ironclaw: *had already told the Dark Lord that Harry would need an Inheritance Test done after the adoption to get his full name as Harry was too young to understand what his new name would be and might get it confused with his current name.*
Griphook: *holds the vial*
Ironclaw: *presents a silver knife for each to use to add their blood*
Harry: *drinks the vial, makes a face, and hands it back to the Dark Lord.*
Lucius: We need to do the Inheritance Test and we will need to go shopping afterward.
Lucius: *gives Harry an encouraging smile.*
Severus: The Vow Dumbledore made me take to keep working at Hogwarts. I already turned in my notice for Hogwarts, at the end of my contract. He still is expecting me to be a part of his group.
Severus: *saw the Dark Lord tilt his head in agreement.*
Ironclaw: *explains why the Vows showed up on the Inheritance Test.*
Severus: Max is in bed already. From the way you look, it had to be an interesting meeting.
Severus: Highlights, I know I need sleep.
Lucius: I do too. Draco is coming over tomorrow.
Severus: Tea?
Severus: *sits down.*
Severus: He didn't call the meeting originally to let us know the Potters were missing. He didn't know until about an hour before the meeting started. The meeting was called because they were worried about Lupin being a spy. The idea was that because Lupin was a dark creature he must be the spy."
6,14328048,Severus,Lucius,"Severus: He didn't call the meeting originally to let us know the Potters were missing. He didn't know until about an hour before the meeting started. The meeting was called because they were worried about Lupin being a spy. The idea was that because Lupin was a dark creature he must be the spy.
Severus: I agree. How they decided on him, I am not sure. When Lupin showed up at the meeting, they seemed very surprised by his appearance. Lupin reported to everyone before Dumbledore arrived that he saw Black packing and Black wouldn't tell him where he was going. Lupin thought Black was the spy. Dumbledore's arrival ended that debate as he said that the Potters and Black were missing. He found them missing early this morning when he went to see them regarding an alarm going off in his office. It was a good thing to get a purge done on Max because he had them tagged with tracking charms. He found them in America, now the interesting thing is that all three had memory charms on them. Lily is also pregnant with another child. Dumbledore tried to break the charms but he couldn't.
Lucius: Black was annoying. He kept going on about how we wanted to kill them and then we had to take a magical oath that we weren't there to kill or curse them. I didn't get a chance to tell you before Gringotts and afterward Max and Draco were a bit high strung from the sugar Bella gave them. I thought it was going to take me forever to get Max to sleep tonight because of the excitement but he fell asleep as soon as his head hit the pillow.
Severus: Well, Max is safe for now but Dumbledore is set on pushing that the prophecy means Neville Longbottom is the child. He said that Frank and Alice meet the same requirements. Neville was born the day before Harry Potter. He is trying to move them into the house in Godric's Hollow. I have no idea why he is so set on using that house. That being said, he still wants to try and locate Harry and has a few people looking into old ways of tracking. He tried to get Minerva, Moody, and me to take oaths to protect Neville. We declined. The big issue was everyone wanted to know what he was going to do about the Potters. I got to spend twenty minutes with everyone tossing out ideas on how to find Harry and get him reunited with his parents. Dumbledore finally got tired of it, held up his hand, and said that there was nothing he could do. They had to find Harry. He did mention putting Harry with Lily's sister once he was found. I know Lily's sister; she was a cruel and vicious person. He knows she abused Lily when their parents weren't around. He knows she will do it to Harry. The only reason why they didn't abandon their son at Petunia's was that Lily had a fear that Dumbledore would have forced them to take him back.
Lucius: So he is counting on being viewed as a savior when he goes for Harry when he turns eleven like he wanted you two to do.
Severus: It gets worse. He must have thought I left because he pulled Minerva and Moody aside, he told them that he has decided that since the Potters with Black, ran he is going to try and get control of their seats. He has to wait until Lord Black dies but he wants it all lined up so he can step in and take the seats. He plans on petitioning to be the magical guardian of Harry Potter when they find him and taking control of the Wizengamot, in order to remove control from our faction.
Lucius: That will be very interesting. I wonder what he will do once they realize they can't even see who has the seats. Lucius and I had them sealed. Lord Parkinson will remain Chief Warlock for another year then Lucius will take over after that.
Severus: How do you want to handle his plan? He also wants people to keep patrolling Diagon Alley and Hogsmeade. He is submitting a bill next week for Aurors to be able to reveal a wizard or..."
7,14328048,Lucius,Severus,"Lucius: That will be very interesting. I wonder what he will do once they realize they can't even see who has the seats. Lucius and I had them sealed. Lord Parkinson will remain Chief Warlock for another year then Lucius will take over after that.
Severus: How do you want to handle his plan? He also wants people to keep patrolling Diagon Alley and Hogsmeade. He is submitting a bill next week for Aurors to be able to reveal a wizard or witches' left sleeve to check for the dark mark. Moody warned him that it won't go through.
Lucius: It won't. We already have the votes in place to stop it. He tried to submit a similar one for entering into the Ministry.
Lucius: Marvolo!
After breakfast:
Reggie: How did the Order meeting go?
Severus: It was chaos. I honestly know why they never get anything done. They can't agree on anything."
8,14328048,Severus,Dumbledore,"Severus: Last night, Dumbledore decided, again, to be late to his own meeting. I had to listen to them think of new ways you were going to attack the Longbottoms. One side saying you were gone and they weren't moving to Godric's Hollow nor did they feel like they should hide any longer. The other side were people like Molly Weasley who was screeching about endangering their son and how you were biding your time. She went on about how to protect Neville and how important it was to protect all the children as her brats were screaming. I am not looking forward to teaching her twins.
Lucius: How many do they have? I heard like nine.
Severus: Seven. The other six were running around screaming before Dumbledore arrived. One is Draco and Max's age and is a right menace. Has a fit anytime he doesn't get his way. Their daughter will be a year old in August and already can do no wrong if you listen to Molly's bragging.
Lucius: I know but I don't want him to be a brat.
Severus: Agreed. What happened when the fashionless statement showed up?
Lucius: It was the same thing it was about the hunt for Harry. He pushed Frank to move into Godric's Hollow but Frank declined. He told Dumbledore that Longbottom Manor was good. After another round of that, Dumbledore finally got to you. He believes you are lying low, recruiting, working on finding the Potters and Harry. He believes you are going to kill the Potters and has warned them. They have refused to return to England. He seems to have the prophecy focused on them. I heard Minerva complaining to Filius how Dumbledore keeps writing to the Potters and that the owls are apparently not up for flying that distance. Most of Hogwarts' owls are old.
Severus: Dumbledore started on Frank. He has a brilliant idea of a marriage contract between Neville, who they think might be a squib, and Ginevra Weasley. The test showed Neville had some magic but they haven't seen the boy use his magic. Dumbledore has been trying to form a strong pro light alliance but no one seems to want to have any direct ties to it.
Lucius: Yes, many in the Wizengamot are growing weary of hearing him speak about how the Dark Lord is going to wipe all the muggles out, kill all the muggle-born and half-bloods, or the new theory is to enslave them.
Severus: *sighs* We have been carefully watching the Potters. Lily had another boy, two days ago. We have been keeping a very close eye on them. We have also been tracking their owls, the Hogwarts owls are very tired, he keeps using the same three and they aren't getting any rest.
Reggie: Potter and Dumbledore had the nerve to try and get the Potter's newest spawn named the Potter heir. Ironclaw got the notice about it from their branch in New York. It was denied and the Potters were given a copy of the contract. Dumbledore just got told it was denied.
Reggie: My father has already set his Will in place, Max is named as his heir. He enjoyed meeting him. My parents said if you ever need someone to watch him, they would love it.
Severus: We can't do anything to them as of yet, Dumbledore is still too interested in them. However, I was thinking, since she isn't pregnant, I could slip them some potions that would have an interesting effect on the Potters and Black.
Reggie: It would be easy, Sirius is having my parents send him things for the three of them. My mother and father have only been doing it because he is family, but after this weekend they won't.
Reggie: I am sure if we gave them to my parents they would do it. You know they support you and if we told them it was punishment for abandoning Max, they would send the box, gladly."
9,14328048,Reggie,parents,"Reggie: My mother and father have only been doing it because he is family, but after this weekend they won't.
Reggie: I am sure if we gave them to my parents they would do it. You know they support you and if we told them it was punishment for abandoning Max, they would send the box, gladly.
Severus: Done, my lord, I have a few specific potions that will work wonders on them and they are long lasting, untraceable on most scans.

Narcissa: Draco! What have I told you about hitting others?
Narcissa: I have told you before you need to learn to share your toys with your brother.
Draco: No! He's not my brother, he's the leftover.
Lucius: Max, no one is going to hit you again.
Max: Draco hits always.
Lucius: Everything will be fine.
Severus: Max, why didn't you say something?
Max: Told he mean to me.
Max: Nag'n come too?
Lucius: I will speak to Narcissa and see if any of those books have any ideas on how to handle this.
Severus: I read them and they do. Let me know which one you select and I will do my part.
Max: Sev'rus? Read.
Severus: Cat.
Severus: Read him the story, we will speak after he is sleeping."
10,14328048,Severus,Lucius,"Severus: What book?
Severus: Read him the story, we will speak after he is sleeping.
Lucius: He has the Black gift, I know it's strong because he has Sirius, Reggie, Cissy, and Bella's blood. He is connected to Marvolo through blood before the adoption, is it possible the blood adoption increased his core?
Lucius: I know some of the gifts in the Black line besides Metamorphmagi are the mind arts and magical resistance. The Slytherin, Gaunt, and Peverell line are flight, Parseltongue, and mind arts. Malfoy is Veela charm, mind arts, and a chance of being an empath. We know he is already a parselmouth and metamorphmagus. I wouldn't be surprised if he is great with the mind arts and flying. He has those gifts multiple times in his blood, the addition of the Malfoy blood might have been enough of a push to bring forth the other lines abilities.
Severus: Some of them we don't want their abilities brought forth. I am thinking of the Kipple family, for example, insanity runs rampant in their line, Crabbe and Goyle might benefit.
Lucius: True. What happened while you got the pleasure of attending Dumbledore's Order meeting last night?
Severus: Yes, sadly for me, I attended. It seems they are still trying to get the Potters to return. No luck in locating Harry Potter and they are running out of ideas. He again tried to get the Longbottoms to hide at Godric's Hollow. Frank and Alice are getting annoyed with him.
Lucius: I could speak to Augusta Longbottom, I know her and Frank have been at the Ministry and Wizengamot listening to him go off on tangents and haven't been impressed. Frank usually rolls his eyes."
11,14328048,Reggie,Lucius,"Reggie: Do I have a sign somewhere on me that says light families come to me for help? Does my dark mark show through my robes?
Reggie: What happened?
Lucius: Longbottom approached me at the Ministry, he wants to speak to you.
Reggie: Did he say anything else?
Reggie: My parents reported that Sirius is asking for another shipment of items. It seems in their recent bouts of illness and other issues, they have gone through a lot of tea and other items. My parents didn't reply as of yet, but we're wondering if you wanted to gift them with some items again.
Reggie: Sirius also sent them photos of the newest Potter, Merlin that kid is ugly, it's like he got the worst of their features.
Severus: I thought the Weasley red hair stood out.
Narcissa: Oh, my. Is that the newest Potter?
Lucius: Yes. His name is Herman.
Narcissa: Dobby and Nobby have them in their playroom. They saddled that poor child with that name. He is going to be picked on something dreadfully. What were they thinking?
Narcissa: I have a few potions I made especially for them. I also will include things that will be just for the child so they won't be tempted to give anything to the spawn. I think Cissy and I can make a trip to Honeydukes for a few things.
Narcissa: I was hoping we could send another package to them. Does he know he has been disowned?
Frank: Good. Your mother and wife?
Frank: We took down the main family ones, if you can just cast a few times outside to leave the..."
12,14328048,Dark Lord,Severus,"Dark Lord: They are already stunned. My mother is by Neville's door, Alice is on the stairs. I will close the door, you destroy it and stun me by it, I think Dumbledore will buy into that. There is a pile of ashes by Neville's wardrobe with a black cloak on top so be careful not to step into that mess.

Chapter 4: He Is An Idiot
Severus: I am sorry but that man is an idiot."
13,14328048,Neville,You-Know-Who,"Severus: It will be in tomorrow's paper that Neville is Boy-Who-Lived and that he had defeated You-Know-Who. As I know today's only given the minimum of details.
Lucius: The-Boy-Who-Lived? You should have the other names suggested. One was the Defender of the Light.
Severus: It gets funnier. I liked Righteous Savior.
Frank: Dumbledore wanted to use it to appeal to the Muggle-born and their religion. He said that it would show the Muggle-born they were welcomed in our world.
Severus: He was going on about it until Minerva pointed out it would drive them away as it insulted their Christian religion. My personal favorite was Light Defender of the Realm.
Frank: Those were the better ones. Some were just awful, like Boy Wonder, someone referenced a comic book called Batman, so might want to check that out.
Severus: I did at the comic book comment. When I was growing up, Lily introduced me to another friend; he had comic books and loved Batman and Superman. The Boy Wonder was the sidekick to Batman.
Reggie: How long did the name debate last? Can you imagine if James and Sirius had been there?
Frank: Most of the meeting. Albus had me meet with him earlier, I didn't know I was going to be meeting with only him but he wants to train Neville. He cautioned me about keep Neville away from bad influences and how he needed to be brought up correctly. He asked if we were going to have other children and suggested we wait a few years so that the child wouldn't feel neglected.
Lucius: If you do that, you will be sleeping on the couch for life.
Severus: Is that why you looked like you wanted to kill him when I arrived?
Frank: No, though I wasn't happy with what he was saying, I knew he was going to try something, he wouldn't be Albus if he didn't. What got me upset was Molly deciding that since Neville was now famous, her brats should have play dates with Neville. She never even wanted to hold Neville before today, though she fawned over Harry. She then proceeded to make the arrangements before I could respond. I told her I would speak to Alice but I couldn't commit. Albus butted his nose in, saying how he was sure it would work out. Now I have to tell my wife, she has to put up with the Weasley brats tomorrow.
Severus: During the meeting, Dumbledore mentioned sending an owl to the Potters letting them it was safe for them to return home.
Alice: Yes, and told me that James and I would make wonderful partners as Aurors. I reminded him that Sirius was his partner. He stated that Herman could benefit from knowing Neville. How they could be best of friends, a powerful alliance. I almost thought he was going to start drafting a bonding contract between the two boys.
Severus: He wants to get as much publicity from this as he can. He wants to have interviews, get some photos of Neville published. He pulled me aside and asked if..."
14,14328048,Severus,Sirius,"Severus: I reminded him that Sirius was his partner.
Unknown character: He stated that Herman could benefit from knowing Neville. How they could be best of friends, a powerful alliance. I almost thought he was going to start drafting a bonding contract between the two boys.
Unknown character: Alice and his mother would have very strong objections to any plan that Dumbledore could come up with.
Unknown character: He wants to get as much publicity from this as he can. He wants to have interviews, get some photos of Neville published. He pulled me aside and asked if I could brew some glamour potions with a small calming draught mixed it this afternoon as I was in the library returning some books to Irma. He already has some ideas of making sure he is in charge, Frank. Be wary of him asking you to sign anything. I saw a bit of a plan in his head when I caught him off guard. He wants to be viewed as the one in charge of Neville. He wants everyone to have to go through him to get to your son.
Severus: He mentioned hiring you and Potters as professors. Asked me how good Lily was at potions too.
Unknown character: He asked me if I was interested in the DADA spot, I told him no. He hinted that he was going to offer James the flying assistant and Lily the potion spot since you are leaving. When I asked him about how that would work since as Aurors we would also need to work our shifts. He said he would get us assigned to Hogwarts.
Severus: He wants me to stay now. He offered me a pay raise, a few weekends off a month, and fewer hours doing hall patrol. He mentioned Lily could do the Muggle Studies course if I remained.
Unknown character: The man has a lot of plans.
Lucius: How many positions are opened? The Board is only aware of your spot. He hasn't submitted any applicants for the job either.
Severus: As far as I know the only remaining staff will be Minerva, Filius, Hagrid, Binns, Sybill, and Argus, everyone else is either retiring or quitting for one reason or another. The DADA professor is retiring, he only signed up for a year to fill in his time for the Aurors to get his pension, he was injured last summer. The Muggle Studies professor quit going to classes in March, after some of the Pureblood children asked her to explain some Muggle things and how they worked. When she did, the Muggle-borns told her she was wrong and ended up teaching the class for the rest of the year. He hired a Pureblood to teach a Muggle Study classes, and she had no interaction with Muggles. The incident spread to the other years and houses, think she spent her time with Sybill, drinking the sherry they seem to like. Every time I saw her, she smelled like a distillery.
Reggie: Dumbledore will be furious. When Sirius finds out he has been disowned, you know he will go running to Dumbledore to complain about it.
Unknown character: True and you know we can't get anyone in those positions unless they are unmarked. The wards he set up tell him who has a dark mark.
Severus: I can return, he wants me to be there for Neville and Herman. He wants me to protect them. He has been pressing me since I gave my notice.
Severus: I can rent the space out. Mr. Slugs wants to open a branch in Hogsmeade. If I allow him to rent it out, sell my potions in his stores, and get a discounted rate on ingredients, he should agree to the terms and I still get to keep the research contract with St. Mungos. He has been after me for a few years to sell my potions in his stores. It would enable me to do both.
Frank: Would you have any time to even sleep if you did that?"
15,14328048,Alice,Neville,"Frank: I have an idea. I don't know if you would agree but Alice is good with potions, maybe see about getting her as an assistant, you know he will go for it.
Unknown character: Yes, he would. Mr. Slugs would also agree, as most of the potions he requires have a long shelf life and can be brewed in a large quantity. I will see if Dumbledore will let me use some of my more promising students as teacher assistant to allow Alice time with Neville and me to brew. They can grade first and second-year essays. Dumbledore will agree, believing I am mellowing if I allow students to assist. He also doesn't want to lose his spy and he would believe with Alice there, he would have a closer tie to Neville. I can also suggest people for the missing positions. Since he knows I have a mastery in Defense, I can get someone in that spot if they aren't marked.
Frank: Do you have an idea who?
Frank: I have one. Frank stated. Remus, he hasn't trust Albus for a wee bit, and with the Potters and Sirius taking off without a word to him, he might be willing to listen. I can speak to him, show him the memories. We know he wouldn't object as he would believe Remus would be one of his followers.
Unknown character: Severus? The Dark Lord looked at his friend. He glanced at Lucius, he knew Lucius was thinking the same thing. They should have started to recruit Order members a lot sooner.
Frank: While I don't care for him personally, I agree with Frank. Lupin, even tonight, wasn't happy with what was happening. I don't even think he spoke a word.
Unknown character: He didn't. Frank began to think of ways to speak to Remus.
Unknown character: Frank, see what you can do. The Dark Lord loved the idea of one more removed from Dumbledore and one that would be on his side. If he wants to speak to me, let me know and we can arrange a time and place.
Severus: I will send a message to him later tonight. Does tomorrow around lunch time work for you, Frank?
Frank: Yes, it will allow me to escape the Weasley brats. I hope those twins of hers don't prank my wife or mother.
Unknown character: If they prank your mother, she will feed them to her hat. Lucius had a slight smile on his face as he pictured the image. I will get you the memory vials before you leave Severus.
Unknown character: Thank you, Lucius. After the meeting besides what I just informed you about, I believe you will find it interesting.
Unknown character: What? The Dark Lord wondered that the fashion mistake was plotting now.
Unknown character: Dumbledore doesn't believe that Neville was the true prophecy child. He believes you only went after Neville because you were forced and that Neville only survived because you didn't use the killing curse."
16,14328048,Severus,Lucius,"Severus: I will get you the memory vials before you leave Severus. *slight smile on his face as he pictured the image.*
Lucius: Thank you, Lucius. After the meeting besides what I just informed you about, I believe you will find it interesting.
Severus: Dumbledore doesn't believe that Neville was the true prophecy child. He believes you only went after Neville because you were forced and that Neville only survived because you didn't use the killing curse but some other spell that has a green light. He is going to be researching to find out which spell it could have been. He believes the prophecy will happen later on which is another reason he wants the Potters here. He wants to set up another confrontation when you return from beyond. He wants me to stick close to you and for me to work your way into the Elite.
Frank: Elite?
Severus: I told Dumbledore that I was only an inner circle and that the elite had more information. I hinted to him that Lucius was an elite member and used it as a way to go to Malfoy Manor more as a way of getting more information. It also works as a way of me not being able to provide him with certain information. I informed him that the elite members were a secret part of Death Eaters and only a select few were aware of them. *Severus thought it was very creative.*
Frank: Impressive. It allows you to feed him information while allowing you a lot of leeway with what you provide. He would never have thought of that. *Frank loved the idea that the Dark Lord protected Severus. Dumbledore certainly does that for any of his spies. It was why he never had many.*
Severus: Marvolo thought of it. When we started to feed Dumbledore information, we needed a way to create some reason to give me an out on not giving him all the information. *Severus felt protected when the Dark Lord suggested it.*
Lucius: We might need to set up a way to protect Frank, Alice, and Remus if he joins. *Lucius was trying to cover a yawn.* A Vow won't work.
Frank: It would work, once Remus agrees, which I feel he will, we can do the three of us. *Frank stated.* His Legilimency skill is one of the reasons Alice wasn't there tonight. She didn't want to take the chance he would try it. Last night my mother and Alice just avoid looking him in the eye."
17,14328048,Alice,Neville,"Severus: Alice is usually messier with Neville when she tries to give him beets. The boy hates beets.
Frank: Ruined her white shirt last week when Neville tossed a few beets back at her when she turned to scoop up some chicken for him.
Lucius: He hates them. I have tried everything. He will eat anything else. Draco, on the other hand, hates everything.
Frank: It's a stage with Draco. Neville is starting it.
Lucius: Great. What happened?
Severus: Dumbledore called a staff meeting. It appears we have a new Muggle Study Professor and an Assistant Flying Instructor, who will also fill in for Remus during that time of the month.
Frank: He doesn't know that he hasn't been removed from the family and Dumbledore wants him to return to being an Auror, but according to the Mutt, he was denied. They didn't like him leaving without notice. Now he is looking for someone on staff to use him as an assistant.
Severus: Alice wasn't sure what position he would take as she reminded Dumbledore that all the Professor slots are filled. She also brought up the Board didn't approve of either of the Potters positions. I don't know how Alice says things so sweetly. Dumbledor believes everything she says.
Severus: Was that her that gave Lily the hag look when they were leaving yesterday?
Frank: Yes, she saw them leaving the Headmaster's office, followed them down as they were exiting the front door, cast the spell, and hid in that alcove to the right. James was furious. He stormed back in trying to find out who did it.
Severus: I saw him and was able to hide before he blamed me. Not that I would have cared if he did, I just didn't want to listen to Dumbledore lecturing about respecting the Potters.
Severus: It will work, especially with my mother on the Board.
Severus: Unless he used Potter with Minerva, she used to brag about his skill in Transfiguration. She does need the help. He might have a problem regarding getting her to agree, ever since she found out about them abandoning Harry she hasn't spoken a word about them, even in Order meetings.
Lucius: It won't work, part of their contracts with the Ministry is that in the future they must be available to call back to duty, if they took an apprenticeship, it would interfere with the contract they have with the Ministry. Magic won't allow it. The contracts are for ten years after you leave the Corps. They don't mind a regular job but an apprenticeship isn't classified as a job. It's a willing bond by magic to someone else for at least four years, depending on the area you are going into.
Lucius: I will make sure to mention that at the Board meeting which is tomorrow. I know Severus would love to see them cleaning the castle."
18,14328048,Lucius,Dark Lord,"Lucius: They came back and have no jobs.
Dark Lord: Unless they want to be hired as assistant groundskeepers and assistant caretakers.
Lucius: I will make sure to mention that at the Board meeting which is tomorrow.
Reggie: Wonder if we could require uniforms for them?
Reggie: You will have to take pictures, Severus.
Lucius: Maybe prank them into French Maid Outfits.
Remus: I will arrange it. I will try to make Dumbledore think he won too.
Lucius: I will warn my mother.
Dark Lord: We will be able to keep an eye on them at the same time.
Severus: It should be an interesting answer especially since the Order is still looking for him.
Lucius: I already sent Nobby to tell Severus I was here and to join us.
Dark Lord: I am guessing it is good news?
Lucius: Wait until Severus is here. Frank was at the meeting with his mother so he and Augusta will tell Alice and Reggie.
Severus: You're joking?
Lucius: I wish I was. He said you were fine with it and went on about how you two were best friends since before you started Hogwarts.
Severus: I will just tell him with Alice assisting me. I won't have time as we have the store and the Infirmary to make potions for.
Dark Lord: I bet he wasn't happy with that since everyone in his pocket follows Augusta's vote.
Lucius: That was the beginning.
Severus: You mean it gets better?"
19,14328048,Lucius,Severus,"Lucius: That was the beginning.
Severus: You mean it gets better?
Lucius: Yes, the Potters and the Mutt only have one-year contracts, if for any reason there is a valid complaint concerning them, they are fired. The complaint doesn't even have to do with their jobs, there is a morals clause in the contract. If for any reason it's broken, they are fired immediately.
Lucius: Yes, and we got our unmarked followers as a few professors. Ian McAbbot is now the Muggle Studies professor, Horace Whitman is now the Magical Law Professor.
Lucius: Yes, I spoke with Augusta and we had the votes and facts set up so Dumbledore couldn't object.
Severus: That man has been refusing to allow that class for a course elective.
Lucius: It's now a requirement for first through third years if they are Muggle-born, third through the seventh year it is an elective open to all students.
Severus: The best news is that Binns is going to be exorcised tomorrow and Augusta is going to be taking over as the Magical History professor. We tried to get rid of that Divination excuse of a professor but he refused to budge, she is on the list to go next. Augusta and a few others want her out.
Severus: It won't take much to get her fired.
Severus: I was thinking about it. If we did it in Diagon Alley, they could say he was at home. If we do that and let others start to notice they have never seen him, it will build up slowly. However, I am wondering if Dumbledore might do something like have them blood adopt a child and claim it's Harry.
Severus: True and I bet Dumbledore would do that except he has made it known that they don't have Harry so unless everyone in the Order goes along with the deception, he can't do it.
Severus: What do we want to do? Their brat will be at Hogwarts and that gives them less than a month to find a solution.
Lucius: You have an idea of what they will do, don't you?
Severus: We wait and request a death certificate.
Lucius: Yes, and it will be a very well-made forgery and we will call them on it.
Lucius: Exactly. I do believe payback time has arrived. We will have to make sure that their child doesn't get sent to those Muggles."
20,14328048,Lucius,Severus,"Lucius: Yes, and it will be a very well-made forgery and we will call them on it.
Lucius: Exactly. I do believe payback time has arrived. We will have to make sure that their child doesn't get sent to those Muggles.
Lucius: The Weasley family or someone will take him. We know they won't allow anyone not associated with Dumbledore to claim their child. Since they will be still alive, Dumbledore won't be able to interfere with the placement.
Severus: He won't but he is going to have to find a way to get Minerva and the others from exposing the deception, so I expect we will know about it.
Lucius: Lily might also talk to Alice. She won't think anything of going to her best friend about how remorseful she feels about the death of her first-born.
Severus: She would. All I can say is that Potter corrupted her. She would never have done something like this.
Severus: I need to go and check on Max, it's almost this bedtime and I promised him two stories if he behaved.
Severus: You aren't going to come up and say good night."
21,14328048,Severus,Lily,"Severus: I am so happy to be back here.
Lily: *told him*
Severus: *didn't even bother to comment* Well, if it isn't Snivellius.
James Potter: Fleabag.
Severus: *refraining from what he wanted to call the man* Remus, the werewolves, have they made a decision?
Remus: Yes, and they refuse to join. Most don't want to be involved.
Severus: *knew the man was lying* Are you still welcomed with them? Do you think you can convert a few?
Dumbledore: I am still welcomed, I can't guarantee that they will join the Order but they haven't turned me out.
Frank: The werewolves have been quiet. The Aurors department had fewer calls concerning werewolves.
Moody: It's true. Do you think we should worry about it?
Dumbledore: *asked Severus* 'Fenrir hasn't been around, none of the other werewolves' clans either. The Dark Lord hasn't mentioned them, lately.
Potter: What has he been doing?
Severus: *ignored the idiot* The Dark Lord has expressed renewed interest in the prophecy. He doesn't believe it is about the Longbottom child. He is looking for other children.
Dumbledore: Has he found a child?
Severus: *noticed the quick glance by Dumbledore toward the Potters* No. He is looking into Muggle-born and those in Knockturn Alley. He doesn't believe its Potter or Longbottom. He has also been looking into different calendars, different decades, he isn't sure that it is about a child per se.
Minerva: What do you think it means? How can we find out who he is going to go after?
Black: Snivellius is useless. Some spy.
Severus: *didn't even glance at the annoyance* I am aiming to move into his elite. I just need to provide some good intelligence and I can make the step. He is already aware that the Potters have returned. One of his spies in the Ministry informed Lucius. Lucius was eager to inform him that they are back.
Dumbledore: I will see what information I can have you give him by the end of the meeting, Severus. We, however, need to focus on finding Harry Potter and hope he doesn't find him first. He must be looking for Harry.
Molly: Are you sure?
Alice: How can we be sure?
Dumbledore: The prophecy is about Harry, I am sure. We need to remain in control of the situation. I still have my house in Godric's Hollow ready for us to protect the Potters once we find Harry.
Minerva: Where are you staying now, James?
James Potter: Potter Manor."
22,14328048,Molly,Alice,"Molly: Are you sure?
Alice: How can we be sure?
Dumbledore: The prophecy is about Harry, I am sure. We need to remain in control of the situation. I still have my house in Godric's Hollow ready for us to protect the Potters once we find Harry.
Minerva: Where are you staying now, James?
James: Potter Manor.
Severus: Next order of business, we need to find a Professor's assistance jobs for Sirius, James, and Lily. Severus, I know I asked you about working with Lily, may she work with you?
Severus: No, as I already informed you, Alice and I are busy enough with making potions and I can't add more work to our already busy schedule.
Dumbledore: Lily will help ease the stress.
Dumbledore: No, I have a contract with Mr. Slugs and it lists only Alice and me as the brewers. I have a new apprentice who will be grading the younger years' work. Mr. Slugs will be providing additional training for my new apprentice.
Minerva: I see. Minerva, perhaps you could use James while I see if the new Defense professor could use Sirius.
Minerva: Why can't James and Sirius go back to being Aurors?
Frank: They were turned down.
Moody: Crouch doesn't want them to return for fear of them running again. He wants people who don't run in fear.
Lily: We were protecting Herman.
Molly: If we can return to our discussion.
Severus: I believe I have a solution. James and Sirius, you will assist Hagrid and Argus. Lily, I could use an assistant.
Black: Great. We can prank.
Severus: You will be cleaning up any pranks.
Remus: Enough with that name. He stuck around and is doing something important to help with the war effort.
Black: Figures, you would stick up for him. Once a traitor always a traitor.
Dumbledore: Dumbledore cast a quick Silencio before it could get out of hand.
Frank: That was certainly interesting.
Remus: Yes, and I believe we should create more issues, by pushing Black and Potter.
Severus: I agree. I will tell the Dark Lord what happened tonight. He will be happy that Lucius was able to make sure that Black and Potter were kept from key positions in Hogwarts.
Frank: I did find it interesting that Black was the one who calmed the boy down. He also held him and carried him out of the meeting.
Severus: I agree. From the first meeting with them and the Dark Lord, they didn't pay attention to their first son. When Max was asked about things, he mentioned that they didn't hold him. He latched onto us and Nagini because of it."
23,14328048,Severus,Black,"Severus: I did find it interesting that Black was the one who calmed the boy down. He also held him and carried him out of the meeting.
Frank: I agree. From the first meeting with them and the Dark Lord, they didn't pay attention to their first son. When Max was asked about things, he mentioned that they didn't hold him. He latched onto us and Nagini because of it.
Severus: I used to worry about that aspect too. It got worse when they learned he was parselmouth.
Remus: Good night, Frank. I will go and visit the Dark Lord and report to him what happened.
Severus: Remus, why do they think you are a traitor?
Remus: Because I didn't jump to their defense when they were complaining earlier in the day about not being welcomed back in the Auror Corp and when Dumbledore began to ask around for them to get assistant professorships, I warned them that they wouldn't get the jobs because of their leaving.
Severus: I see. Remus, you know they are just blaming you for their errors.
Remus: I know, and Severus, I still firmly believe we made the right choice. Dumbledore and his kind need to go. Have you spoken to Minerva? I don't believe that Molly and the others will leave the man.
Severus: I haven't but I am going to start feeling her out.
Severus: She could have taken James or Lily and she didn't.
Remus: I agree. Also, her attitude toward them before you arrived was very chilly, the same with Dumbledore.
Severus: We better head out, we don't want them wondering why we are talking.
Severus: Yes, I had wondered how that was possible.
Severus: Yes, someplace in Little Whining, Surrey. I only remember because Lily was bragging about how her sister had brought a new house. This was before our friendship fell apart.
Severus: She knows what her sister is like.
Max: Sev'rus, you going to do potion?
Severus: Not today, I am just here for a few minutes. Why don't you go and get ready for your mother?
Max: Hug?
Severus: I just gave you one.
Severus: Fine, Brat.
Max: What about me?
Severus: I always give you before we leave, not going to stop."
24,14328048,Severus,Max,"Severus: and get ready for your mother?
Max: Hug?
Severus: I just gave you one.
Severus: Fine, Brat.
Max: I always give you before we leave, not going to stop.
Max: I can do magic?
Max: I did magic.
Lucius: Not even Draco.
Max: Why, Father?
Lucius: Because it's a secret, you can keep a secret, right?
Max: I can. I have kept all my secrets.
Lucius: Yes, you have. You're such a good boy. I believe you can even get a Chocolate Frog after dinner.
Max: I will make sure.
Narcissa: Max, you ready?
Max: Yes, Mother.
Narcissa: Walk, like the little gentleman I know you are.
Max: Yes, Mother.
Severus: I wonder how long it will take Potter to go whining to Dumbledore.
Lucius: Good, couldn't happen to a better bunch of people.
Frank: We will tell you afterward. You are going to love it.
Remus: Potter and Black.
Remus: Let me pull my memory of it as I know you will love watching it.
Black: Albus, we were evicted out of Potter Manor and we can't get into any of the properties.
Dumbledore: What happened?
Black: We don't know. One minute we were sitting in the dining room having our lunch when suddenly the Manor started shaking and we found ourselves out in the middle of the lane. When we tried to get back in, the wards wouldn't admit us.
Remus: He knows what happened and why.
Frank: We thought we..."
25,14328048,Potter,Remus,"Potter: He knows what happened and why.
Remus: Exactly, he also can't say anything because of the Vow I made him take.
Dumbledore: James, did you know that Lily paid for the house?
James: No, I didn't. It's not just the Manor. It's all the properties.
Dumbledore: James, where did you put Harry? Who did you give him to?
Potter: *turns his head away*
Dumbledore: Sirius?
Black: *tries to answer but nothing comes out*
Severus: So am I. The two of them are idiots.
Frank: You make me sick. You have done something to your son, James. You should be ashamed of yourself.
Remus: You don't think he killed him and there is a new Lord Peverell or Gryffindor?
Dumbledore: *looks angry*
Lucius: I know exactly when we can do it too.
Severus: Where are the idiots staying?
Remus: Hogwarts, they're starting their jobs early.
Remus: I was thinking how do pink tutus and maybe some French maid outfits?
Frank: Count me in.
Lucius: Hopefully, Dumbledore and his fried chickens will be plucked and finished before the boys even start to think about Hogwarts.
Severus: We might be able to get some of the laws pushed through now too.
Severus: It looks like we will have a busy few weeks.
Lucius: *nods in agreement*"
26,14328048,Lucius,Dark Lord,"Lucius: Pink tutus?
Dark Lord: Yes, French maid too. What do you think he is going to try?
Lucius: From watching him, he is going to try for a recount. He will try and see if you are dark.
Dark Lord: He seems more set on trying to get the seats returned to Potter and Black. Potter is eager to hand Dumbledore whatever documents he might need. Black is looking nervous as if he knows whatever Dumbledore is going to try won't work.
Lucius: Madam Bones is avoiding looking at them.
Dark Lord: She has something interesting.
Dark Lord: Ironclaw?
Lucius: Tom, back corner there is a woman with the blond hair, standing next to a guy in grey robes.
Dark Lord: She is the head of child services. The man standing next to her is the barrister for that department. Judging by where they are looking, Potter and Dumbledore are about to find some trouble.
Dark Lord: I think Harry's about to be declared deceased.
Lucius: What did you set up?
Dark Lord: I didn't. Remember when we told Ironclaw to handle the muggles and have Harry Potter disappear, I believe he has done it.
Lucius: We could use it.
Dark Lord: *nods his agreement*
Dumbledore: The start of introductions and new business may now proceed.
Lucius: I have the honor of introducing Lord Rodrid Peverell.
Black: He's the one who booted us out of your homes.
Lucius: New business?
Madam Bones: I am here to ask for an arrest warrant for James Charlus Potter and Lily Rose Potter nee Evans for child abandonment and manslaughter of Harry James Potter."
27,14328048,James Charlus Potter,Lily Rose Potter nee Evans,"Lucius: New business?
Madam Bones: I am here to ask for an arrest warrant for James Charlus Potter and Lily Rose Potter nee Evans for child abandonment and manslaughter of Harry James Potter.
Dumbledore: Why is this in front of the Wizengamot?
Madam Bones: While this isn't normal procedure, it is a bit of an unusual situation.
Madam Bones: We have confirmation from a variety of sources about the Potters giving up their son with no idea where he is at.
Potter: Harry is fine.
Madam Bones: Produce him or tell us where he is.
Lucius: Anyone object to the warrants being issued?
Potter: I can't.
Aurors: Sirius Black, you are also under arrest for accessory to child abandonment and manslaughter.
Lily: What? He's-
Auror Dawlish: Lily Rose Potter nee Evans, you are under arrest for child abandonment and manslaughter of Harry James Potter.
Lily: My baby, who will take care of him? My baby, where is my Herman? I need to take care of him.
Dumbledore: Lily, Herman is in the hands of Lady Marchbanks until a suitable home can be found.
Lily: Albus, you can let them do this. You know Harry was a freak, he was dark. He wasn't the boy for the prophecy. Herman is. Harry was evil. He wasn't good.
Dumbledore: *heart froze as he listened to her speak*
Severus: He's losing it.
Frank: Great a crazy Headmaster with a control issue is making new plans to destroy our world."
28,14328048,Headmaster,Frank,"Frank: Great a crazy Headmaster with a control issue is making new plans to destroy our world.
Severus: His mind is an open book. He is creating new plans and they aren't good.
Alice: You must have good news.
Lucius: I do. As you know they arrested the Potters and Black. Amelia, back by Cornelius, was ready for a full trial. As soon as Amelia mentioned going to trial for murder, Potter demanded a barrister. After an hour or so, the barrister comes out and spoke to Amelia. Potter and Black wanted a plea deal.
Reggie: Really?
Severus: It doesn't surprise me.
Lupin: It doesn't surprise me either.
Frank: It doesn't surprise me either.
Alice: Yes, her too. It got better. Potter and Black started spilling their guts about everything they knew about the Order, Dumbledore, and Hogwarts. They covered their years there. Guess who ended up admitting to almost killing you, Severus?
Severus: You're joking. How was that possible?
Lucius: Amelia started out with some simple questions but several times they tried to dodge the questions or even tried to dismiss answering it. Amelia reminded them of their agreement, their barristers did too. Finally, after thirty minutes of their lying, she separated them, demanded truth serum. While they were waiting for the truth serum to arrive, she called a house-elf to retrieve the detention slips regarding them. When the truth serum arrived, she started with Black first. She went into the integration room with slips and it went from there.
Severus: The Mutt has no filter either so with the truth serum, he would have been spilling his guts.
Lucius: He was. She was in the room for five hours before she took a break.
Lucius: She started last night, finished with Potter and Lily this afternoon. They won't be going in front of the Wizengamot for a trial. They are going to be serving twenty-five years for child abuse, neglect, involuntary manslaughter for Harry for Potters, Black got the same sentence with another ten years for Severus.
Lucius: It gets better.
Reggie: Better?
Lucius: Exactly, Potter explained about the prophecy. He even explained some of those raids we had wondered about on dark families. While they were done with a legal warrant, the warrants were obtained illegally. Dumbledore was the one who provided the fake evidence. He also provided the identity of the families, some of which were dark, but Potter and Black planted evidence given to them by Dumbledore.
Lucius: Dumbledore was arrested tonight. They were escorting him and a few Order members in as I was leaving. They wanted to arrest him at the sentencing of the Potters and Black. However, Lily had the most interesting information.
Tom: Lily?
Lucius: Yes, it seems she knew the prophecy was faked. The Unspeakables headed to the Hall of Prophecies and they were able to verify it was a fake. Lily took a potion to get pregnant with Harry. When James and Lily heard Harry speaking to a snake, they wanted to get rid of him."
29,14328048,Lily,Lucius,"Lily: That clearly confused everyone.
Tom: Lily? What could she have that would make Lucius so excited?
Lily: Yes, it seems she knew the prophecy was faked. The Unspeakables headed to the Hall of Prophecies and they were able to verify it was a fake. Lily took a potion to get pregnant with Harry. When James and Lily heard Harry speaking to a snake, they wanted to get rid of him. However, when Dumbledore found out, he talked them into keeping Harry as a way to lure Marvolo out of hiding and destroy him. Lily was fine with the plan until one day she took a trip to the Hall of Prophecies and arranged to hear it. She found the charm on the orb. The orb was charmed to look, feel, and even act like a prophecy. Two days later is when they spoke to Reggie.
Frank: What can they do to him? I don't know if they could get him on anything but fraud.
Frank: Fraud, accessory to their crimes after the fact and since he knew about them and didn't turn them in when they returned. He will also be facing breaking the law for falsifying evidence and in some cases manufacturing evidence. All of it is minor but he will lose his titles and he can't be the Headmaster any longer. They will be reviewing his past and I believe Amelia mentioned something about his Order of Merlin. Amelia has to review all the raids, it will allow families to sue the Ministry for damages due to raids, also it will release a lot of people from Azkaban.
Frank: Is there evidence enough to make the charges stick?
Lucius: They are going to pull every case any Order member worked on.
Severus: We are living in strange times.
Alice: Thinking?
Frank: No, reflecting. Look, dark family, light families, creatures, all getting along. No house hatred, no fear of werewolves. I'm glad you spoke to Reggie, I'm thankful you did. Makes me fear what our world would have been like had we followed Dumbledore's path.
Marvolo: He wanted a war, thankfully Marvolo didn't.
Marvolo: I think I got the better end of the deal.
Tom: The Potters had no idea the joy they gave up."
