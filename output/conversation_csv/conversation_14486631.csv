0,14486631,Peter,May,"Peter: Hey, May?
May: Yeah Pete?
Peter: I was just wondering, next week is career day at school... they're having a bunch of kids' parents come in to talk about what they do, you know, try and give the students some idea where they might want to work after high school. Do you... do you think you could do it? They asked our class to bring our parents, so...
May: Peter, I... I wish I could. I really do, but I can't afford to take off work right now. Money has been a little tight lately, you know? I can't afford to lose more shifts than absolutely necessary, you know?
Peter: Yeah, yeah, I get it. Work is more important.
May: Peter, that's not what I--
Peter: No, no, I didn't-- I didn't mean it like that. I just mean, you know, money is important for... for living, so going to work is important. Besides, it's not like everyone's parents are going to be able to show up for the same reason, right? It's alright, May.
May: I'm sorry, Pete. I know it's hard for you when these kind of things happen. You know if I could, I would.
Peter: Nah, it's fine, it's alright. I should head out, I'm gonna be late.
May: Okay, have a good day! I love you.
Peter: I love you, too. *rushed out the door*"
1,14486631,May,Peter,"May: “I love you, too,” *shouted over his shoulder as he rushed out the door.*
May: *rubbed her hand over her eyes as she sat back in her chair.*
May: *Looking at the clock and grimacing at the time, she got up to gather her stuff for work.*
May: *She grabbed her purse off the counter, not realizing it was upside down, and cursing when everything fell out of it.*
May: *She crouched down to gather all her stuff when he saw her phone light up with a text.*
May: *She stared at the name on her screen, an idea popping into her head.*
May: *Before she could change her mind, she unlocked her phone and pressed the call button.*
May: “Hey, Tony? Yeah, it’s me. Wha-- no, no, Peter’s fine. Yeah, he can go to the tower, that’s fine. Listen, I uhh… I kinda need to ask you a favor, if you’re willing. For Peter.”

Peter: *Peter sighed and tried to bury his face further into his arms on his desk as he listened to Brooke’s dad go on and on about being a firefighter in New York.*
Peter: *He was jolted out of his melancholy thoughts when everyone started clapping around him.*
Peter: *He looked up and noticed that Brooke’s dad had finished his presentation, so he clapped politely along as they waited for the next person to set up.*
Peter: *He frowned at hearing his name, still unsure what exactly was going on.*
Peter: *He watched as his teacher continued to stand and stare out the door for a minute before seemingly remembering herself and taking a step back.*
Peter: “Of course! If you could just go sit next to him until your turn, he’s in the back on the right side.”"
2,14486631,Peter,Tony,"Peter: Mr. Stark, what are you doing here?
Tony: I’m here for career day, Pete, what does it look like I’m doing, Tony said, reaching up to take his sunglasses off and tuck them into his jacket pocket, and what did I tell you about that ‘Mr. Stark’ crap?
Peter: How did you even find out about this?
Tony: Your aunt mentioned you were bummed she couldn’t come, so I said I’d go instead.
Peter: Mr-- Tony, you really didn’t have to--
Tony: Well I did, and now I’m here, so don’t worry about it, Tony said, crossing his legs and leaning back to rest his arm on the back of Peter’s chair. Now, pay attention. This is important for future career decision making.
Peter: *rolled his eyes at Tony’s words and matching smirk, but sat back and paid attention to the Thomson’s presentation anyway. Or, at least, he tried to. It was a little hard to pay attention when half the class and their parents kept glancing back to stare at both him and Tony, but Tony seemed to able to ignore them, so Peter just tried to do the same. He even tried to ignore the looks Flash and his parents would throw to their corner of the room every now and again.*
Ms. Abernathy: “Alright, who would like to go ne--”
Tony: “We will!” Tony said, throwing his hand up like a -- well -- high school kid. Peter felt his face burn as his whole class seemed to turn as one to stare back at them.
Ms. Abernathy: “Alright!” Ms. Abernathy said, a little overly-cheerfully, “up next is Peter and Mr. Stark!”
Tony: “Call me Tony, please,” Tony said with a smile as he walked to the front of the class, suitcase in hand, Peter following meekly behind.
Tony: Alright! Tony clapped before unbuttoning his suit jacket and putting his hands in his pockets. For those of you who don’t know, my name is Tony Stark and I am the owner of Stark Industries I run the R&D department, come up with new ideas for the Stark brand, and I am also the figurehead and unofficial-official tech guy for the Avengers Initiative. Oh, and sometimes I�"
3,14486631,Tony,Peter,"Tony: So just really quick, I’ll show you a couple projects that both SI and the Initiative are working on right now. This, of course, is only one small example of the types of things we create at SI and of what I create for the Initiative. Peter here is going to show you some of the features on the newest version of the Stark Phone, which will be available for purchase in a couple months. Peter, could you grab the phone and pull up the accessibility features… yeah, the updated text reader - this particular function was Peter’s idea actually….”

Peter: *held up the phone and the tablet and ran through the newest and improved features as Tony explained what they were and how they were different from previous versions of the tech.*

Tony: Now, the part I’m sure you’ve all been waiting for,” Tony smiled as he held up the watch, “my latest work for the Avenger Initiative. Don’t worry, anything weaponizable about it is deactivated, so while it looks cool, this thing is basically useless in a fight right now unless you punch really hard.”

Peter: *looked up at Tony with wide eyes, glancing down at the watch an lifting his eyebrows to ask Tony if he was sure that’s what he wanted.*

Tony: *rolled his eyes and reached down to grab Peter’s wrist, lifting it to fit the watch on as he kept talking to the class.*

Tony: “Now, this particular version of the watch is actually my own personalized version, so no one else in the Initiative has a watch that does what this one does except for the Avenger Colonel James Rhodes, otherwise known as War Machine. You’ll see why here in just a second.”

Tony: “Pete, if you would be so kind as to demonstrate.”

Peter: *stared at Tony for a moment before he lifted his other hand to the face of the watch, tapped in the correct sequence, and pulled the nanotech down over his hand as it took the form of a replica Iron Man glove around his hand. The class gasped as Peter held the hand up and moved his fingers around - the whirring of the mechanized hand could be heard throughout the room.*

Tony: “The watch is designed to offer protection to whoever is wearing it so that they are never unarmed if they are ever caught unawares. This particular watch has a miniature, less powerful form of the Iron Man glove stored inside of it using nanotech that forms to the shape of the hand of whoever is wearing it. It usually is weaponized similarly to my Iron Man glove but don’t worry - all weapon capabilities are turned off, so no one is going to accidentally get shot.”

Tony: “This watch has the ability to shoot less powerful versions of the power blasts that usually come from the repulsors on my Iron Man suit, which is why it is a little different from the standard issue watch we use at the compound. Usually standard issue has a built-in laser, taser capabilities, is waterproof, fireproof, shock absorbent - practically indestructible, it’s connected with the AI installed upstate, and is used as a communicator between agents who work in the Avengers Compound. It also has a holographic interface that projects from the screen - Peter?”

Peter: *gestured at Peter, and Peter pressed a button to retract the glove and pressed another to start up the projection, showing the date, time, and what the weather was like outside. He pressed another button so the screen changed to show he had a new text message from Bruce Banner, a voicemail from Steve, and three new emails from Rhodey and Pepper. The glass oohed and ahhed as Peter showed off the watch using the holographic interface projected above it.*

Tony: “And that’s about it!” Tony said as Peter turned off the watch, took it off, and put it back in Tony’s briefcase with the phone and the tablet. “Any questions?”"
4,14486631,Tony,Peter,"Tony: And that’s about it! Any questions?
Ms. Abernathy: Alright, well if no one has any questions for these two how about we go ahead and thank Mr. Stark for taking the time to come down here and talk to us all.
Peter: Thank you so much, Tony, for coming down here. I know you must’ve been really busy and I don’t want to keep you away from your work, but-
Tony: Don’t worry about it, kid. I told you, if you ever need anything, I’m here for you. Even if it’s just that your aunt is unavailable and you need someone to come visit your school for a couple hours.
Peter: Still, thank you. You didn’t have to do all that.
Tony: I know I didn’t, but I wanted to. For you. So. Don’t complain, you’re welcome.
Peter: Are you sure you don’t want to stay for lunch?
Tony: Ew, and eat high school cafeteria food!? Sure, why not. Lead the way.
Peter: *feeling that familiar sense of comfort and safe wash over him again when Tony put his arm around Peter’s shoulders and ruffled his hair*"
