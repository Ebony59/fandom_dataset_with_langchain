0,14681208,Tony Stark,Loki,"Tony Stark: Kid, please gimme a reason Loki's been spotted talking to Spiderman that isn't 'I wanted to be his friend'. Please. Tell me you can do that.
Peter: I could?
Tony Stark: And that reason would be the truth?
Peter: If you wanted it to be the truth it could be.
Tony Stark: That right there, that right there, is why I know it's gonna be a lie.

Peter: Thor told me you were dead.
Loki: *shrugs*"
1,14681208,Peter,Ned,"Peter: *looks, sees, thinks, sighs, shrugs*
Ned: *looks over his shoulder* Loki?
Peter: That's major. And he didn't try to stabby-stab? A little knifey-knife?
Ned: That sounds dumb.
Peter: But he didn't?
Ned: Nah. He gave me peanuts and told me he wasn't dead? I think he's lonely.
Ned: Lonely.
Peter: I said what I said.
Ned: He's the god of mischief.
Peter: Yeah, so he probably doesn't have any friends."
2,14681208,Tony Stark,Loki,"Ned: Dude, did you just send Tony Stark a fuckin' yeehaw emoji?
@NeighbourhoodWatch: spiderman sighted talking to a man on the roof of the southwest multi storey [im.g229337]
@stevefuckinrodge223: dude thats loki
@aaaaaron4409: holy fuck lmao yeah look at this pic its him 2012 vs him talkin to spidey [im.g220238]
@NeighbourhoodWatch: spiderman sighted talking to loki, apparently ;)
@aaaaaron4409: lol
Peter: Sorry, miss, *when she's dusting off her lapels, looking - angry. Maybe about the sunglasses?* Sorry about them - but, you woulda died. I caught you.
Lady: Thanks, *heavy, laden with bitter sarcasm. Not sincere.* Listen, maybe think about chilling out once in a while, huh?
Peter: But you almost got hit, *There are tears tracking down her face, and her mascara has stained her cheeks black, face exposed now her sunglasses are in a million pieces on the puddly road.*
Lady: Maybe I wanted to, *she says, and she's way older than him. Thirties, at a guess, and he's sixteen and he's saved her life and she hasn't wanted it saved.*
Peter: Okay, *he says. He probably shouldn't, but he can't think of anything else to say, and Karen has gone silent to let him think.* I - miss, you want someone's number?
Karen: Your heart rate has elevated. You saved her life, Peter.
Peter: Yeah, Karen, thanks for pointing that out, *he says dully, and leaps out of the line of traffic himself. Tony has to deal with nuclear missiles and aliens and gods and stuff, but he doesn't have to deal with the regular people, who are often so inventively fucked up that he suspects the regular Avengers wouldn't know what to do. Maybe Sam would. Maybe Doctor Banner.*
Peter: He buys a sandwich, and doesn't point out how he's been short-changed even though he sees the guy do it, and he swings himself up onto the roof of a taxic"
3,14681208,Peter,Loki,"Peter: Why did you buy it if you refuse to eat it?
Loki: What are the red things? Poison?
Peter: Tomatoes. I don't like them, but I like the rest of it.
Loki: Why don't you ask them to leave the tomatoes out during the creation?
Peter: I do, but they don't listen. You wanna try?
Loki: Unappealing. I don't like it.
Peter: Join the club.
Loki: You are up late. I would hope life finds you better.
Peter: I've seen better, I guess. Seen worse, too. Just another day, right?
Loki: That is one thing I could never understand about my brother.
Peter: Huh?
Loki: Thor. He's kind of a big deal down here?
Peter: Yeah, I know who your brother is, dude. Uh. He's done well for himself on Midgard, much as Odin told him to stay - but there are like-minded people on every planet, every realm, and all you have to do is look. But my brother... he has always enjoyed the heat of battle, to some extent. He feels joy when he swings Mjolnir and the heads tumble at his feet... and then later,"
4,14681208,Peter,Loki,"Peter: I'm aware. He's done well for himself on Midgard, much as Odin told him to stay - but there are like-minded people on every planet, every realm, and all you have to do is look. But my brother... he has always enjoyed the heat of battle, to some extent. He feels joy when he swings Mjolnir and the heads tumble at his feet... and then later, he feels guilt for it. But Thor is quick to push this to the back of his mind. He is a man of war.
Loki: I would not say I am a man of peace. But guilt - is stronger, now.
Peter: *holds out the last tomato slice and, wordlessly, Loki takes it.*
Peter: Once upon a time, a man who was a friend of my son told me that if someone were to waste all their time on regret for the lives they failed to save, they would do nothing but fail further to save lives that had not already ended.
Peter: Oh.
Peter: *finishes his sandwich, and they sit for a while longer, looking out at the city teeming with life.*
Peter: *rolls his mask back down and says goodnight, in a voice that shakes*
Karen: *call tony stark?*
Peter: *shakes his head, and leaps off the side of the wall.*
May: *sitting up waiting for him, but she's fallen asleep with a cold mug of tea in her hand and a cold mug of hot chocolate sitting at the place next to her.*
Peter: *tidies up the dishes, kisses her on the forehead, and lifts her to bed without her waking - then he goes, and lies on his mattress and stares at the roof and tries not to have bad dreams until his alarm goes off at seven on the dot.*
Ned: Spiderwatch twitter says you talked to Loki-
Peter: Spiderwatch twitter,
Peter: Dude, Ned, c'mon, I told you that's crap. Neighbourhood Watch is way better-
Ned: Neighbourhood Watch admins must have been asleep, 'cos they only put it up half an hour after Spiderwatch.
Peter: My fansites squabbling, Peter flicks imaginary hair over his shoulder, all of the heaviness from the early morning gone. Almost. Loki's sentence had been hard to interpret, but once Peter realised what he was saying, there was a heavy lump in his gut that hasn't gone away yet. Get on my level, man, soon you'll have, like, War Machine picking you up from school-
Ned: He already does, when he picks up you, Ned says absently, still staring at his phone. But - Peter, are you sure about Loki? I mean. Like. I know it's super cool and all, and I would never, like, stand on your superhero groove toes or whatever, but-
Peter: Groove toes-
Ned: *elbows him* Dude, this is important. Man in the chair business. I gotta look out for number one.
Peter: Dude, number one is you, Peter says. They dodge out of the way of freshmen running through the corridors, and Ned ducks into the little space where their lockers are, Peter beside him.
Peter: Not for men in chairs. Number one is the target.
Ned: No, the target is who we're gonna kill.
Peter: I dunno, Jason Bourne, Peter says. Point is - Loki isn't a bad guy.
Ned: If the next words out of your mouth are he's just misunderstood, I'm sitting with Flash at lunch, Ned says. The bell rings; they start trudging up the stairs to American Lit, which is probably the dumbest class Peter has ever sat in.
Peter: He's just looking for someone to talk to, I think, Peter mumbles. I gave him the tomatoes out of my sandwich.
Ned: *raises an eyebrow*"
5,14681208,Ned,Peter,"Ned: He's just looking for someone to talk to, I think, Peter mumbles. I gave him the tomatoes out of my sandwich.

Peter: Loki is cool, man, is what he says instead. Loki is cool.

Ned: Old sport, Ned mutters in Peter's ear, and MJ shoots them a look, and the three of them grin.

Peter: Old sport, Peter mumbles back.

MJ: I studied European mythology, specifically the development of the grey antagonist, she tells him, a berry burst capri sun hanging out of her mouth. Wanna check it over, see if there's any spelling mistakes?

Peter: Dude, is that homework? Ned looks down in alarm. An essay on Gatsby?

MJ: Was it useful? She asks, a biro shoved in her ponytail, her hair cascading down her back. She has a freckle on the tip of her nose; Peter blinks at it, until she waves her hand in front of him."
6,14681208,MJ,Peter,"MJ: Was it useful? *she asks, a biro shoved in her ponytail, her hair cascading down her back. She has a freckle on the tip of her nose; Peter blinks at it, until she waves her hand in front of him.* Oi. Parker. Useful?
Peter: Uh... yeah actually, *he says. Yeah, I think so.*
MJ: *She gives him a pleased little huff, which he supposes will have to do.*

Ned: Woah, you have a handler, *Ned says, looking over Peter's shoulder with stars in his eyes.* You are Jason Bourne.
Peter: *Peter hides his screen so Ned can't see the spam of emojis and cat gifs he's sent Happy in the last week.* Totally, *he says, Yeah, I'm a big deal. Got a handler and everything. Like - if I'm James Bond, he'd be Q-
Ned: I thought I was Q-
Peter: No, you are Q-
Ned: But you have Q-hair more than I do-
MJ: *MJ throws the Encyclopedia Britannica at them (V-Z) and they turn around, apologizing in mutter.*

Peter: check in what
Happy: Heard about some extracurricular escapades.
Peter: ohhh u mean decathlon
Peter: lol im there atm
Happy: Don't be obtuse.
Peter: lol gotta turn my phone off
Peter: sorry dude you the gr8888est
Peter: B)

Karen: Hello, Peter,
Karen: *An icon flashes up on his HUD: man with an iron plan is calling, and a dumb picture of Tony that Peter found online, from 2009 when he exclusively wore muscle tees and dickhead sunglasses.*
Karen: Would you like me to accept the call?
Peter: Yeah, sure, *he stops his journey across the city and just kind of dangles upside down from an iron stairwell.*
Peter: Hey, Mr. Stark, *he says.*
Tony: Hey, kid.
Tony: *Tony is calling from his workshop, not Paris or Sydney or Dubai or anywhere else - there's grease on the end of his nose, and wrinkles of age curling in the corners of his eyes. He's got a holey t-shirt on, and he looks kinda normal.*
Peter: *The call hangs in the silence for a few seconds. Peter isn't sure why Tony is calling, and he thinks maybe Tony isn't sure either, except -*"
7,14681208,Tony Stark,Peter,"Tony: What's got you busy this weekend?
Peter: Uh. I? Nothing? Patrol? Why, is there a mission? Is it gonna be like Germany and stuff?
Tony: Woah, I was thinking more, maybe Happy could pick you up. Come down here, bug about with the suit.
Peter: Oh! Yeah, sure, that sounds cool. It's a playdate. Keep yourself out of trouble, kid.
Karen: Tony Stark has disconnected, Peter. Do you want to call back, or-?
Peter: Nah, nah, it's good. Thanks, Karen.

May: Of course you can go.
Peter hears: Keep you out of trouble down here.

Loki: So, you go to Stark on Friday. It's a good day for travel, Friday - a day for woman, which does not mean a day for rest.
Peter: Okay, uh, not to be - weird, or anything, but how do you know where I live?
Loki: Magic, or maybe I followed you. You might never know which one is true.
Peter: Hey, now you're here, you know anything about America in the twenties?
Loki: I don't know anything about America now. Why would I know your history? Do you know the war that took place between Vormir and Asgard, long before Earth was even conceived?
Peter: That was when you tried to mess with Mjolnir, and the dwarves turned you into a fly, or something. I read Norse myth. Did that happen, or is it not real?
Loki: Close enough, I suppose."
8,14681208,Loki,Peter,"Loki: Close enough, I suppose.
Peter: *wonders where Loki has been all this time, whether he's been wandering the world humming and eating processed foods.*
Loki: You didn't spell that right. There are two cs in the middle, not one.
Peter: Thanks. Man, I'm beat.
Loki: No bruises? No physical harm?
Peter: Nah, I mean... It's like, y'know. Tired?
Loki: Beat emotionally, then. The origin of the phrase?
Peter: Never thought of it.
Loki: Etymology not something you enjoy?
Peter: I think it's cool. But my friend - MJ, she's awesome - she's into all that stuff. I like... science, I guess. Making things? I made the web stuff, and these.
Loki: I thought you produced it naturally. Fascinating. Science, the understanding of nature through natural explanations? A magic of sorts, you would say.
Peter: Huh. I guess you would.
Loki: I told that to Tony Stark, long ago. Enjoy yourself this weekend, Peter Parker. And remember to act the age you are, rather than the age you think you should be. And sleep. Don't be beat.
Peter: You too.
Loki: *is gone*

Tony Stark: Parker. I thought you were sending Happy.
Peter: He did send Happy. He just also sent himself.
Tony Stark: What's the point of being the most famous man on the planet if you can't scare the shit out of a bunch of nerds every so often?
Peter: I made an impression, then.
Tony Stark: Who's Flash? Want me to, like, Instagram him?
Peter: Absolutely not, but thanks. I, uh, got my overnight stuff. And the suit. Mind if I go back Sunday morning? Me and May usually- We do, like, y'know. Aunt-nephew bonding time.
Tony Stark: I wouldn't dream of interrupting, naturally. Leave whenever, kid. Oh, and there's - we're going upstate-
Peter: *realizes that upstate means going to Avengers Compound*"
9,14681208,Tony,Peter,"Tony: I want to talk to you, *leans back, thumb soaring across his phone screen* Oh, and there's - we're going upstate-
Peter: Is it Captain America?
Tony: Nah, it's Thor.
Peter: Flash is gonna shit himself if I get a selfie with Thor.
Tony: Who am I to condemn a little bit of harmless highschool hazing? Go ahead, kid, knock yourself out.

me: guess who gets 2 hang out with thor
maybejaybe: ask him if he likes pineapple pizza
maybejaybe: if he says no, kill him
maybejaybe: spoiler: he did
me: ill get thor to say hi to u both
me: and then ill put it on sc
me: and flash will die. literally

Tony: Need a hand, short stack? *lifts the overnight bag, shouldering it with ease* There's a bunch of spare rooms you can take, and Friday-
Tony: Yeah, Friday can tell you where to go, if you get lost or whatever.
Peter: Awesome.

Tony: Since you won’t let me upgrade your damn phone, *explains, with a little too much gruffness than needed* But, yeah, come on down when you’re ready. Oh, and bring bagels? With honey. Since you’re such a great intern, and all.
Peter: Yeah, I’m awesome, *says absently* Uh. Thanks, Mr Stark.

me: Awesome.
me: #perksofstarkinternship
maybejaybe: if he says no, kill him
me: youre all dumb
me: ill get thor to say hi to u both

me: and flash will die. literally"
10,14681208,Peter,Friday,"Peter: Hey, Friday? You there?
Friday: Hello.
Peter: Did you need me, Peter?
Peter: Yeah, uh, do you know where Thor is, right now?
Friday: He is in Queens, Peter.
Peter: You allowed to tell me that?
Friday: Of course.
Peter: Huh. Okay. Where’s Mr Stark?
Friday: The second floor is a workshop. You will find him there. He is quite distinctive.
Peter: Yeah, I know.
Peter: Meet anyone cool lately?
Tony: Nah.
Tony: Kid, you look like a sad puppy when you try to lie. What’s Loki doing hanging around the skyline with Spiderman? Why isn’t Spiderman calling his good old Avenging friends to deal with it?
Peter: I dunno. Spiderman only calls the Avengers when he thinks there’s a threat.
Tony: Peter, he killed hundreds of people.
Peter: Thor’s killed thousands, and you don’t see him getting arrested.
Tony: That’s different.
Peter: Yeah, but - Loki isn’t planning anything.
Peter: Just… drop it. I’m going to bed. Thanks, Mr Stark."
11,14681208,Peter,Loki,"Peter: “That’s different.”
Loki: “Yeah, but - Loki isn’t planning anything.”
Peter: “Oh, he told you, did he?”
Loki: “Just… drop it,” Peter says. “I’m going to bed. Thanks, Mr Stark.”
Peter: *It comes out more bitter than he intends it to, but he doesn’t really mind, and he asks Friday to tell him how to get back to his room, and she shows him.*
Loki: “I wish to atone.”
Peter: “Okay, cool.” Peter is doing his homework on top of a bank, eating his way through a bag of apples. “But you got a big problem. Everyone kinda - like, they think you’re going to do something. Explode Manhattan, probably.”
Loki: “I would tell them I gave them my word, but I imagine that’s worth very little.” Loki is floating a few inches off the ground, occasionally taking small bites out of an apple he’s tossing in the air and catching again. It’s green. Peter tries not to find that as funny as he does.
Peter: “I dunno. Your word from you is a lot more than your word from me.”
Loki: “Tony Stark trusts very few people, and less now. My brother is one. Doctor Stephen Strange is another. Pepper Potts is a third, and James Rhodes is a fourth, and you are a fifth. He trusts me as far as he could throw me.”
Peter: “I saw the news footage of the fight, ‘n it seems he can throw you a helluva way.”
Loki: “Don’t mix your metaphors.”
Peter: “At the end of it all, I can’t get anyone to forgive you if they think you’re mind-controlling a random kid in New York.”
Loki: “I suppose so.”
Peter: Every few weeks, Tony tries to get Peter to stop talking to Loki, or to turn him in. Peter knows it’s a sign of trust, a terrifying one, that Tony doesn’t interfere even when Peter refuses to do what he’s asked - last year, even a few months ago, Tony might have landed in all guns blazing if Peter had pulled a stunt like this.
Loki: But Loki is uncomplicated, in a wonderfully complicated way. Peter coughs up half a lung after rushing into a burning building after a little kid, and Loki cheerfully talks about Asgardian warfare until Peter is too distracted to notice the pain in his chest. Loki’s been teaching him a little close-quarters fighting, and how to use sleight of hand to win in fights, and just two days ago Peter distracted a would-be robber with a coin trick long enough to web the woman to the wall and leave a friendly note for the police to find.
Peter: Ned isn’t worried anymore. MJ was probably never worried to begin with, even if she still officially doesn’t know who Spiderman is.
May: “I worry,” May says, over lasagne and garlic bread that’s only a little crispy. “You know I worry.”
Peter: Peter doesn’t tell her a lot of things, but he tells her the stuff he knows she’d find out anyway. He doesn’t tell her about the broken ribs that heal in half an hour, or the nightmares, or the shakes, although he thinks she might know about those last two anyway.
May: He tells her about Loki, though, because he knows she’ll find out, and because he knows he’s putting her through hell anyway even without forcing her to watch the news reports of the last thing she has left getting chummy with an alien last seen blowing holes in the Manhattan skyline.
May: May looks tired.
Peter: Peter doesn’t think he’ll ever forgive himself for what he’s done to her.
May: “You’re a good kid, but -” she sighs, and hands him the last chunk of garlic bread. “You can’t save everyone.”"
12,14681208,May,Peter,"May: You're a good kid, but - *sighs* You can't save everyone.
Peter: I'm not trying to save him, Peter mumbles. I just - he came up to me one night, and he's nice. And - and doesn't everyone deserve forgiveness for the bad things?
May: *crumples*

May: *cries during the film*
Peter: *cries during the film*

Flash: Notice you haven't got one, Parker, he says loftily during decathlon. Wanna buy? A buck a badge.
Peter: What's it for? Who's the money go to?
Flash: Money goes to the Maria Stark Foundation. It's the Loki Support pin. See?
Ned: *snorts a laugh and tries to hide it under a coughing fit*
Flash: Us in the scene, Flash continues, a little pink, We think Loki's done his time. Everyone knows that alien guy was controlling him, anyway. So you buy the pin, you support the Avengers and Loki.
Peter: You have loads?
Flash: Yeah. I made about a thous- I mean, I got like, a thousand, off the dude that runs this stuff. Big operation. Real big. Legit.
Peter: I'll take three, Peter tells him.

Peter: My friend - person - made them, Peter says. He's got his pinned to his hoodie, so it isn't on the suit, and he thinks there's probably not anywhere he can safely stick a meal pin anyway. See?
Loki: I don't see, Loki takes the green pin anyway. A pin of block colour?
Peter: It's the Loki Support pin, Peter says, fighting a rising giggle at Loki's surprise. Because, like, Loki's a friend of Spiderman now. It's totally cool. See?
Loki: I don't, but sure, Loki says. He takes it, still, gingerly, as though it would explode if he holds it wrong. And you - pin it?
Peter: Yeah."
13,14681208,Loki,Spiderman,"Peter: Because, like, Loki’s a friend of Spiderman now. It’s totally cool. See?
Loki: I don’t, but sure. And you - pin it?
Peter: Yeah.

Thor: You talk to my brother.
Peter: Yeah?
Thor: So tell me - how has he been keeping?
Peter: He’s been… good? He likes, uh, Earth food, I guess. He doesn’t like sour cream and onion, though, or tomatoes.
Thor: Wonderful, wonderful. He is acclimatising. Would he consent to see me, do you think, or would be prepare to go through the intermediary of your good self? Could I write him a letter?
Peter: You could try?

Tony: It’s not stupid of me not to trust someone that threw me out of a building.
Peter: Thor trusts him.
Tony: Thor’s different and you know it. Oil, c’mere, these joints are fucked up. Jesus, Dummy, why didn’t you say anything?
Peter: You should install a speaker next, so he actually can.
Tony: Good plan, Parker. Best intern yet.
Peter: Only intern yet.
Tony: Same difference.

Thor: Give this to him. And tell him his brother would like to see him, when he is ready.

Peter: *gives Loki the letter and pretends he doesn’t see him wiping tears away.*
