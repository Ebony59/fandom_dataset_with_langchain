0,15732231,Peter,Mr Cobbwell,"Peter: Mr Parker! *startled Peter into awareness* Thank you for your kind attention.
Mr Cobbwell: Class, I have just received a notice, *the teacher announced, waving the bunch of A4 sheets in his hand* Our field trip has been scheduled for next week, and I have permission slips for all of you here. Now, there are rules and regulations, as always, regarding conduct of students as representatives of the school; in addition to those, there are venue specific rules this time. Everything is outlined in these forms. They will have to be signed by a parent or guardian and returned to me by Monday.
Sally: Where are we going, sir?
Mr Cobbwell: It seems we have been granted permission to go to Stark Tower!
Flash: Isn’t that really unsafe, sir? That whole area’s, like, a major target for all sorts of–
Flash: Shut up, Mendes, *scoffed Flash* Since the Avengers went upstate it’s been fine! What are these rules, Mr Cobbwell?
Mr Cobbwell: Well, there’s mainly health and safety regulations, so you can’t leave the tour group at any point, if you have a disability please mention it in the form, security badges are to be worn at all times – you need to submit a passport size photograph for your ID – phones are not allowed in certain areas, no hacking or stealing because that sets off alarms, and you can only update your social media once."

It's all written here, guys! Take a form on your way out, and remember – Monday latest!
Flash: Hey Parker, guess we’re going to your workplace! Can you ask your boyfriend Spiderman to come by this time?
Peter: Oh, he’ll be there, muttered Peter. What was his life?!
May: When I saw the email from your school, I couldn’t control myself, she laughed. What is your life, even?
Peter: That’s what I thought too! I mean, I was really quite worried at first because, you know, but then I realised, no one at the tower knows except Happy and Mr Stark! And not like they’re gonna drop by! By the way, this is delicious, May–
May: I know, isn’t it? I got the recipe from Geeta, it’s not quite like she makes it but it’s good, right?
Peter: Totally, it should go in the book, Peter assured her. What is it, a korma?
May: You know, I forgot to ask her...
Mr Cobbwell: Harrington told me about your reputation, Peter, grinned Mr Cobbwell, who seemed in high spirits. You’re the last one here!
Peter: Sorry, sir, there was traffic! replied Peter, rushing into the bus and finding the seat Ned had saved for him.
MJ: You walk to school, scoffed MJ from the seat across him.
Peter: *grins back*
Flash: Psst, said a voice behind him. Thinking it was Ned, Peter turned back, but saw Ned had turned back too, and Flash was smirking at them. Hey Penis, I’m surprised you showed up! Thought you’d be conducting the tour for us – you know, since you’re an intern and all that.
Ned: Peter’s a STEM intern, man, Ned snapped. Stark Tower has proper guides to conduct tours.
Cindy: Hey, Peter, Cindy called out. Do you know all the staff there?
Peter: No, not really, Peter replied. I tend to go there in the evenings, so I don’t really know the daytime staff. Plus I stick to my labs, you know?
Flash: A likely story, scoffed Flash, but was mainly ignored.
Peter: Some days Peter burned to ask Flash about his dad’s car. He only wished he’d had the suit then, if only for recording purposes. It might’ve helped with the building, but you know. Mainly the video of Flash nearly pissing himself.
Mr Cobbwell: Alright, class, we cannot halt for more than two minutes, disembark quickly and do not leave any belongings behind!
Jack: Once they went through the first security checkpoint and were inside the large lobby of Stark Tower, the students were welcomed by a young man named Jack. He pointed out the toilets and gave them ten minutes to take pictures around the lobby, while he took Mr Cobbwell to sort out the badges. Most students gravitated towards the Iron Man suit display to take pictures."
2,15732231,MJ,Peter,"MJ: I’m not staring at you. I’m wondering if I should protest against capitalism and market domination by one single corporation.
Peter: What are you leaning towards?
MJ: Pepper Potts is the best thing to happen to this company, and maybe I should celebrate the shattering of the glass ceiling.
Peter: Yeah, she’s amazing! She’s honestly superhuman, she handles SI globally AND has time to talk to people AND manage press AND Mr Stark–
Jack: Alright, I hope all of you have gone through the rules for the tour, those were NOT guidelines, and they have to be followed at all time. Mr Watson, he nodded to Alex, the Tower is fully accessible by wheelchair, please be with me in the front so you can see without your classmates blocking your view. If you require any assistance please let me know.
Jack: Now, these are souvenirs, of course. You don’t need to return them, but be warned that once you leave the Tower they will be disabled, so please don’t wander off. If the card is used to access the Tower later, there will be consequences for you, so don’t go selling them on eBay!
Jack: Abernathy, Camille!
Jack: Where is Peter Parker?
Peter: It says in the system that you’re an employee, do you have your ID?
Jack: Well you know the rules, man. Put that on! Jack’s easy smile turned into wide eyes and an impressed look as he saw the red and gold colour of Peter’s badge. He whistled. Dude, nice!
Flash: Hey Jack, so Peter says he’s an intern here, but you don’t seem to know him?
Jack: There’s, like, eight thousand people working here, man. And I just handle the tours, I meet other staff mostly during lunch or something. But an intern under 18? Never seen that. Our security system knows him though.
Mr Cobbwell: Does Peter need to go through the other security? I don’t want anyone to leave the group.
Jack: Oh no, he can go either way.
Cindy: Why were you so impressed with Peter’s badge?
Jack: Yeah, I’ll get right to that in my introduction, let’s just get through security."
3,15732231,Peter,Jack,"Cindy: Why were you so impressed with Peter's badge?
Jack: Yeah, I'll get right to that in my introduction, let's just get through security. *smiled, looking a bit impatient*
Jack: Let's begin our tour with some basic information about Stark Tower. *holding his own water bottle in hand*
Jack: After the Chitauri attack in 2012 and then the reveal of HYDRA, security has been the primary concern for Mr Stark.
Jack: Now I think the girl there asked about ID's? *nodded to Cindy*
Jack: So as you can see, you all have white badges. That means visitor.
Jack: There's a lot of different colors for specialized staff, like green for biotech staff, or cardinal red ('dark red,' he explained at their blank looks) and grey for engineering - can anyone guess why?
Abraham: Colors of MIT!
Jack: Correct! *exclaimed, delighted* Not many people guess that. I always hear Harvard, *rolled his eyes*
Jack: So yeah, lots of security levels. Security has black badges, and what else - oh yeah, service staff has yellow. Anyway, so Mr. Parker here- *pointed at a dismayed Peter*
Jack: Red is for close personal staff to either Mr Stark or Miss Potts, such as managers, PR agents, lawyers, primary assistants, etc. And gold is for all access! This guy here can go anywhere within the Tower!
Alex: Why do you have that clearance, Peter?
Peter: Um...I can't say? *winced*
Jack: Oh yeah man, I don't think I have clearance to even ask, so I didn't! *deflected the class' attention*
Betty: What colors do the Avengers have?
Jack: Yeah, we get this question a lot, but no one seems to know the answer to this, *shrugged* They take the private entrance, so their security is handled..."
4,15732231,Avengers,FRIDAY,"Jack: Oh yeah man, I don’t think I have clearance to even ask, so I didn’t!
Betty: What colours do the Avengers have?
Jack: Yeah, we get this question a lot, but no one seems to know the answer to this.
Jack: They take the private entrance, so their security is handled by the building’s AI, FRIDAY.
Jack: Yes, there’s an AI, yes, she has eyes and ears everywhere. Everyone say hi to FRIDAY!
FRIDAY: Hello, Midtown School of Science and Technology! Hope you enjoy the tour. We’re excited to have you.
Jack: Who’s the other person? With the red and gold ID.
Sally: Oh, right! That’s Miss Pott’s personal assistant, Jameela. She’s being trained to take over a high position, I’m sure, but she basically tails Miss Potts and can cover for her in case of emergencies. She’s got her own underlings as well, and she’s badass, a goddess among men…but yeah sorry, back to the tour!
Flash: So Parker, how’d you score this gig?
Peter: What do you mean?
Flash: Like, are you his secret lovechild or something? We all know Stark slept around, I won’t blame your mom – hey, I’m talking to you.
Jack: My colleague Liam will take over from me now, I’ll see you guys in a bit. Enjoy!
Liam: Hello, Midtown.
Peter: Are you staying back after the tour?
Liam: We’ve got some fun planned, Boss might come by too.
Peter: Mr Stark’s back?"
5,15732231,Peter,Liam,"Peter: Are you staying back after the tour? We’ve got some fun planned, Boss might come by too.
Liam: Yeah, the news isn’t out yet, but according to Jameela, he did it!
Peter: WHAT?! OH MY GOD! Ohhhmygod can you believe–
Mr Cobbwell: *clears his throat*
Peter: *blushes and rushes to take a seat*
Liam: *activates the holo table*
Liam: Ah, I figured someone would ask, but I’m afraid most of what Peter does in the building is confidential and above my clearance level. He’s usually at the lab on 81, and we see him maybe once every two weeks. I can tell you what he does here, if he’s cool with it?
Peter: *nods at Liam*
Liam: *shows the class some of Peter’s recreational work*
Mr Cobbwell: Okay, 15 minutes to have a look around, and off to the cafeteria.
Peter: *rushes Ned to his usual work area*
Ned: I think we can program him to recognize people without a need for a badge.
Peter: Yeah, I can’t figure out how to do that and there’s unwritten rules about messing with others’ work here so no one else has done it either.
Peter: *hands over the code file to Ned, and walks over to Liam*
Peter: So what’s gonna happen? Are they coming here? Ohmygod, are they coming here? Will they BE HERE?
Liam: Calm down, Peter. I have no idea, Jameela didn’t give me much more than that.
Peter: But you’re her boyfriend, get some more info!
Liam: Hey, you know Boss personally, why don’t you ask him?
Peter: I can’t just ask–
Liam: Uh huh, and I can’t just ask either!"
6,15732231,Boss,Mr Cobbwell,"Peter: Hey, you know Boss personally. Why don't you ask him?
Liam: I can't just ask--
Peter: Uh huh, and I can't just ask either!
Luke: *muttering* This is it, we're gonna die, it was an alarm.
Liam: Right! Time for you lot to go to one of the cafeterias for some brunch! Now remember, food's free so go wild. Try the croissants, they're my favourite!
Peter: Mr Cobbwell, is it okay if I stay back here after the tour, or are we doing anything back at school?
Mr Cobbwell: I don't mind, Peter. But it's not up to me. There's your safety to consider, and I don't know any of these people. You're a minor, and I can't leave you here.
Peter: But I come here every week! You know my internship is real!
Mr Cobbwell: Like I said, Peter, I don't mind it. But I am responsible for your safety while you're here. How can I verify anyone's identity here?
Peter: Yeah, um, yeah, you're right, thanks anyway, sir.
Peter: Mr Thor! I didn't know you were here! Oof!
Thor: Well I wasn't, but a wizard made a portal and now here I am! I asked FRIDAY if anyone was here but everyone seems to have gone missing, but then she said you're here, so...
Peter: Right! Great!
Thor: Are these your friends?
Peter: Oh, yeah sorry, I'm on a field trip with my class! It's like sightseeing. This is my friend Ned, and this is MJ.
Thor: Hello, Ned and MJ!
Ned: Whoa.
MJ: *starstruck*
FRIDAY: Mr Stark has arrived.
Thor: Well then young Peter, I shall take your leave.
Everyone: Bye! See you, Thor! Bye Mr Thor."
7,15732231,Thor,Peter,"Thor: Well then young Peter, I shall take your leave, *smiled*.
Ned: Ohhhhhmygod ohmygod ohmygodddd, *pulled Peter's arm so hard it hurt*. THE Thor knows my name! He said my name and said hello Ned and I have to call my mom she will DIE! I love you so much Peter you’re the best!
Peter: *laughing*. Nice! I might drop in if he’s still around ;)
Ned: Did what?
Peter: Ohh wait, did he really do it?
Peter: Yes! I was gonna ask you to call school and tell them to let me stay here after but Mr C says no :(
Peter: How come?
Peter: Says can’t verify these people and so it’s not safe etc.
Peter: He’s right
Peter: I’ll try something hang on
Peter: What?
Peter: May
Peter: May what?
Peter: May!!
Alison: Most people think there’s only STEM internships here, but really, there’s all kinds, *explained Alison*.
Flash: Hey, Miss Alison, *piped up Flash*.
Alison: Yes? *Alison asked, bemused at the response of the class*.
Flash: How would a 15 year old get an internship opportunity? *Flash asked, with a slightly maniacal look in his eye*.
Alison: Well, internships are for college students only, *mused Alison*. So maybe a prodigy who was studying at university might get one? But that’s quite rare, honestly. Those tend to prefer academia over practical applications.
Alison: So how did Peter – raise your hand, Parker – get his internship?
Peter: *sighed in anticipation*. I- I don’t- *he stammered*. Young man, *she started, and Peter could see his life flashing before his eyes*. Access restricted, *came FRIDAY’s voice over the speakers*. You are not authorised to question Mr Parker.
Alison: Sorry, FRIDAY! *called out Alison, laughing nervously, looking sideways at Peter*. I can’t help you, young man, *she said to Flash*. This is above my level.
Peter: *could feel the burning curiosity of his entire class*. As the tour was winding up, it was nearing half past two. Jack handed them all personalised bags with SI goodies, which included t-shirts, an arc reactor shaped lamp, StarkPhone covers, and a really cool travel mug that showed War Machine if the liquid inside was cold, and Iron Man if the contents were hot."
8,15732231,Jack,Peter,"Jack: You may use the washrooms before you leave, I know it’s a while to get back to your school. Please don’t leave any belongings behind! I hope you’ve all had a good time on today’s tour. Enjoy the rest of your day!
Peter's class: *clapping for Jack*
Mr. Stark: Peter! We’re having a party, where are you going?
Peter: Um, hi Mr. Stark.
Mr. Stark: Yes, hi, how was your tour, etc. Party, where are we at? *looking at Peter's classmates and nodding at Ned* You too, Ned, coming?
Ned: *squealing and looking beseechingly at Peter*
Peter: Well I’ll – we’ll – have to go to school and come back, for safety reasons–
Mr. Stark: You’re safe with me, I’m Iron Man. You, teacher, *addressing Mr. Cobbwell* You’re cool with it, right?
Mr. Cobbwell: Uh, yes, yes Dr. Stark. It was more that I didn’t know anyone, but you, I mean, you… *drifted off*
Mr. Stark: I like you, teacher. *taking Mr. Cobbwell's phone and taking a selfie with him* Class photo? *snapping his fingers at his minions*"
