0,15872067,Tony Stark,Peter Parker,"Tony Stark: Hey, kid, you feeling alright? Tony asked, concern lacing his voice as he looked over at Peter, who was curled up on the couch under a pile of blankets. Peter had been sick for the past few days, and Tony couldn't help but worry about him.

Peter Parker: Peter looked up from his spot on the couch, his face pale and his eyes tired. Yeah, I'm okay, he replied weakly, his voice barely above a whisper. Just a little under the weather.

Tony Stark: Tony frowned, not convinced by Peter's response. He walked over to the couch and sat down next to him, placing a hand on his forehead to check for a fever. You don't look okay, kid. Maybe we should get you to a doctor.

Peter Parker: Peter shook his head, wincing at the movement. No, it's just a cold. I'll be fine, he insisted, though his voice was shaky. He didn't want to worry Tony any more than he already had.

Tony Stark: Tony sighed, his worry evident in his eyes. You know, you don't have to pretend to be okay all the time, he said softly. I'm here for you, kid. Just let me take care of you.

Peter Parker: Peter smiled weakly, grateful for Tony's concern. Thanks, Tony, he said, his voice filled with gratitude. I appreciate it.

Tony Stark: Tony ruffled Peter's hair affectionately, a small smile on his face. Anytime, kid, he replied, his voice filled with warmth. Now, let's get you some soup and make sure you get plenty of rest.

Peter Parker: Peter nodded, leaning into Tony's touch. Sounds good, he said, feeling a sense of comfort wash over him. With Tony by his side, he knew he would be okay."
1,15872067,Tony,Rhodey,"Tony: Change of plans. Get in the car.
Rhodey: Tony, what is going on? We're supposed to meet for lunch and then you're twenty minutes late and acting weird and I'm used to a lot of crap, man, but what is this? This is not your usual brand of weird.
Tony: Something came up. I had to make a detour on my way to our lunch meeting. I'm sorry you're gonna miss those bacon sandwiches you like but... *Tony trails off and jerks his thumb, indicating the back seat.*
Rhodey: *twists around and jumps* Holy shit."
2,15872067,Rhodey,Tony,"Rhodey: Tony, what the hell? Why is your sick intern in your car?
Tony: His school called his aunt who’s busy at work so she called me. Nobody’s home at their apartment so I’m gonna take care of him at the compound until he’s feeling better. It’s a chain of responsibility thing we’ve got going. *glances in the rear view mirror and a worried frown appears on his face*
Rhodey: So you’re, what, his dad for the day?
Tony: Please, you know I’m not cut out to be anyone’s dad, *adjusts the car’s air conditioning between sixty-eight and sixty-nine degrees. He hums to himself, dissatisfied, twists the dial again. Seventy degrees. He glances in the rear view mirror at the intern, asks Rhodey, “What do you think?”*
Rhodey: *raises an eyebrow*
Tony: *rolls his eyes and sets the air conditioning at sixty-nine*"
3,15872067,Rhodey,Tony,"Rhodey: Morning, kid.
Tony: Morning, Mister Rhodey!
Rhodey: *grunts*
Rhodey: I'm fine, guys.
Rhodey: Aren't we supposed to, I don't know, be going somewhere?
Tony: Seatbelt.
Peter: Huh?
Tony: Seatbelt.
Peter: Oh! Sorry.
Peter: Mister Stark?
Tony: Yeah?
Peter: What happened to Mister Rhodey? Is he okay?
Tony: Ah, remember last week, when I had to pick you up from school cos you were sick? Yeah. Well I kinda left Rhodey standing in the cold for too long and..."
4,15872067,Tony,Rhodey,"Tony: Yeah?
Rhodey: What happened to Mister Rhodey? Is he okay?
Tony: Ah, Remember last week, when I had to pick you up from school cos you were sick? Yeah. Well I kinda left Rhodey standing in the cold for too long and you’re a millennial, so you won’t understand, but he’s really old and delicate and he’s, well, he’s got distemper.
Rhodey: I do not!
Tony: I knew it. I knew you weren’t asleep.
Rhodey: I hate you.
Rhodey: Hey, kid?
Peter: Yeah?
Rhodey: Shut up.
Tony: Rhodey and I have a big, big day today, don’t we, buddy? I made these bad boys — and thought hey, we could help people with these — wounded soldiers for a start, but one day hospitals too, so anyone who needed them could have access to a set. We’ve got a trunk full of prototype exoskeletons to show to some big cheeses in the government — I kind of fell out with a lot of them circa 2008, but I was hoping that my living demonstration would help me out, but he’s a bit of a zombie today, so I think I’ll leave him in the car.
Rhodey: Like hell.
Tony: I’ll leave the window rolled down a crack.
Rhodey: No, I’m comin’ in. This is important, Tony.
Tony: *nods*
Peter: Road work ahead?
Rhodey: Yeah, they’re laying pipes.
Tony: I sure hope it does.
Rhodey: What the hell?
Tony: It’s a Vine, I speak Millennial.
Rhodey: I don’t.
Rhodey: No thanks, You two keep talking about Tarzan or whatever, some of us need a drink.
Rhodey: Um, Rhodey only has a landline, he doesn’t understand cell phones...
Rhodey: You two keep talking about Tarzan or whatever, some of us need a drink."
5,15872067,Rhodey,Peter,"Rhodey: Hey, kid.
Peter: Morning, Mister Rhodey!
Rhodey: How'd you get on with your algebra test?
Peter: You remembered?
Rhodey: Nice one, Pete."
6,15872067,Peter,Rhodey,"Peter: “You remembered?” *sounds surprised* — Rhodey hears him breathe out a little, “Wow.”
Rhodey: “Nice one, Pete,” *he says, and he has no trouble imagining Peter shrinking at the praise.* *He holds his fist up between the front seats.* Hesitantly, Peter bumps it.
Peter: “Thanks, Mister Rhodey,” *Peter says, and there’s a pleased note in his voice.*
Rhodey: *Rhodey nods to himself, satisfied with a job well done.* Encourage the youth, check.
Tony: “I passed my algebra too,” *Tony pipes up petulantly, holding his fist up in Rhodey’s face.*
Rhodey: *Rhodey rolls his eyes.* “Yeah, thirty years ago. I ain’t fist-bumping you for that.”
Tony: *Tony reels back, mock offended.* “I’m hurt,” *he says, lifting his chin up haughtily.*
Rhodey: *Rhodey just gives him a look and when Tony glances over a moment later, his chin still held high, he bursts out laughing.* Peter giggles too and the mirth in the atmosphere is so infectious, Rhodey joins in — and then they’re all laughing, Tony wiping tears from his eyes as he tries to concentrate on where he’s going.
Peter: *Rhodey doesn’t notice that Peter isn’t laughing anymore until he hears an exclamation from the back seat;* “Oh my god, Tony, look!”
Tony: *Tony’s already looking in the rearview mirror, laughter forgotten at the urgency in Peter’s voice.* Rhodey twists around to see Peter — the kid’s pointing at the sidewalk and Rhodey follows his finger. All he sees is a row of parked cars between the Audi and the sidewalk, then he registers someone running — running fast, weaving between startled pedestrians, wearing dark clothes. A masked man. He’s got something orange in his hand.
Rhodey: “Tony!” *Rhodey shouts and Tony’s attention snaps back to the road and he slams his foot on the brake pedal — Tony was so busy watching the man that he almost didn’t stop for the red light.*
Peter: “I’ve gotta go!” *Peter announces, opening the back door and jumping out, taking off after the man at a sprint.*
Tony: “Pete, wait!” *Tony yells but it’s too late — the back door slams and Peter’s gone.* Tony turns to Rhodey. “Go after him.”
Rhodey: *Rhodey blinks.* “What?”
Tony: “He’s just a — he’s just a kid. I’ll park the car and come find you,” *Tony says, talking fast.* “Rhodey, please.”
Rhodey: *It’s not the car horns honking at them to move already, the light’s green — it’s the look of genuine fear in Tony’s eyes, the helpless little please, that has Rhodey saying, “Okay.”*
Tony: *Tony nods imperceptibly, lets out a shaky breath.* Rhodey loves the Tony he sees when the kid’s with him, the affect the kid has had on his friend, the tenderness, the care, the damn Peter Kit in the glove box — but this? He hates this.
Rhodey: *Mindful of oncoming traffic, he cautiously opens the door and gets out, crosses around the front of the Audi to a chorus of car horns and angry shouting from the drivers behind Tony.* He ignores it all. Once Rhodey’s clear, Tony guns it.
Rhodey: *Rhodey may not be able to run with these leg braces but he can move pretty fast, yet he still feels like he’s taking too long.* Tony’s fear seems to be as contagious as his laughter had been just minutes before — Rhodey’s heart races, spurs him on. He knows which way Peter and the masked man went so he just keeps going as fast as he can."
7,15872067,Rhodey,Peter,"Rhodey: Peter, *crosses his arms* What was that?
Peter: What was what? *innocent tone*
Rhodey: That red thing you just shoved in your pocket behind my back.
Peter: Oh, this? This is — this is a beanie.
Rhodey: A beanie?
Peter: Yeah, a beanie. My — my ears, they, uh, get cold when I run.
Rhodey: Over here! *shouts, eyes narrowed at Peter* *this isn't over*
Tony: Pete? *breathes* Oh, thank god. *puts one hand on Rhodey's shoulder and bends over, catching his breath*
Peter: *waits, still holding the orange purse, wringing his hands nervously*
Tony: Don't *ever* do that to me again, Pete, I'm serious. I have a heart condition.
Peter: *nods, looking guilty*
Tony: Now, down to business — you okay?
Peter: I'm fine, Mister Stark, he didn't touch me. Spider-Man got him before I could."
8,15872067,Rhodey,Peter,"Rhodey: Now, down to business — you okay?
Peter: I’m fine, Mister Stark, he didn’t touch me. Spider-Man got him before I could.
Tony: Oh, is that so? It’s lucky he was here, then.
Tony: Let’s go, *walks past Rhodey with the kid under his arm* — likely more for his own comfort than for Peter’s.
Rhodey: But what about —?
Tony: It’s taken care of. I called 911.
Tony: Alright, fine, but for breakfast I’m ordering something big and greasy.
Rhodey: *looks at Tony over Peter’s head* — message received.

Rhodey: Real Tony’s late this morning — it’s something Rhodey got used to a long time ago, and on a morning like this Rhodey wouldn’t mind too much, yet he finds that he doesn’t want Peter to be late for school.
Rhodey: He’s not even that close to the kid, but he does care. He’s got this innocence to him, it’s bringing out Rhodey’s fatherly instincts. He’s just too damned likeable and Rhodey must be going soft in his old age because he points at another pigeon, standing a little ways away from Pigeon Tony, smaller and with a few feathers out of place, and announces to it, “You’re Peter.”
Rhodey: *waves a fleeting goodbye to them before carefully crossing the street to Happy’s car.*
Tony: Sorry, Rhodey, it’s the booster seat in the back for you today, *not really sounding sorry.*
Rhodey: Hilarious, *opens the back door — to his surprise, that seat’s taken too.*"
9,15872067,Tony,Rhodey,"Tony: Sorry, Rhodey, it’s the booster seat in the back for you today.
Rhodey: Hilarious.
Rhodey: Hi.
Kid: Hi.
Rhodey: Dude, where are you getting all these kids from?
Happy: Buckle up.
Rhodey: You’re usually more polite than this.
Happy: Yeah? Well you try wrangling two actual kids and a grown-up kid at six in the morning, see how it leaves you.
Tony: Hey!
Ned: We had a sleepover at the Compound.
Ned: Okay, but who are you?
Ned: Oh! Sorry. I’m Ned, Peter’s friend.
Rhodey: Nice to meet you, Ned.
Ned: No, it was my first time.
Ned: Mister Stark has all the best tech, it’s incredible!
Rhodey: You been to the Compound before?
Ned: Yeah.
Peter: Yeah."
10,15872067,Tony,Rhodey,"Rhodey: Tony study with you guys too?
Tony: I know more about drainage basins now than I ever wanted to.
Rhodey: Really? Nah, I don’t buy it.
Peter: Hey, Mister Stark, what’s a confluence?
Tony: Where two rivers or streams meet.
Rhodey: Son of a bitch.
Ned: I’ve got one. What’s a blowout depression?
Tony: How I spent the nineties.
Rhodey: You like Spider-Man, Ned?
Ned: Oh yeah! He’s so badass.
Rhodey: Did you see that robbery he stopped last week? That was some serious firepower he was up against but he made it out without a scratch. Amazing.
Rhodey: Hey, Peter, you okay over there?
Tony: You alright back there, bud?
Peter: Huh? I'm fine. I’m just — just nervous about the geography test today. It’s quite important. It means a lot to our final grade.
Rhodey: Right. We were just talking about Spider-Man. Do you like him?
Peter: He’s — he’s okay, I guess.
Ned: Okay? He’s the best! Except for War Machine and Iron Man of course."
11,15872067,Ned,Peter,"Ned: Okay? He’s the best! *says with absolute conviction and Peter ducks his head, a slight hint of rose to his cheeks.* Except for War Machine and Iron Man of course, *he tacks on, finishing with a lame chuckle.*

Rhodey: But you know who Iron Man and War Machine are — they’re people, *Rhodey presses, trying not to grin at Peter’s reaction.* But what if Spider-Man’s an alien? There’s no way an ordinary person could climb buildings like that. He must have tentacles with suckers under that suit — if it even is a suit.

Ned: Ew, that’s gross.

Rhodey: You got something against tentacles, Ned? *Rhodey challenges with a raised eyebrow.*

Tony: Good luck with your test, kids, *Tony says. Having already fed them this morning, Tony just ‘tosses’ his love and support over his shoulder for Peter to ‘catch’ — but Peter’s distracted enough that he forgets to play along.* Okay, my love and support just hit you in the face, Pete. *He twists around in his seat with a little grunt to look Peter in the eye.* You’ll do great, okay. I know it. *There’s no hint of doubt in his tone and Peter nods.*

Peter: Thanks, Mister Stark, *he says and musters up a little smile.*

Happy: Hey, kids, *Happy pipes up and everyone looks at him.* Stop giving each other mushy looks and get out of the car, you’re late for school. Move it!

Peter: Sorry, Happy, *Peter says, gathering his backpack and opening the door.* And you’re going to ace your test, right?

Happy: Yes, Happy.

Rhodey: Thanks for the lift, Mister Happy, *Ned adds and he scooches over to the door.*

Tony: Good luck with your test, too, Ned, *Tony says. Don’t meander.*

Ned: Thanks, Mister Stark, I won’t. *With a final grin, Ned joins Peter and together they jog up the steps to the school door, disappearing inside.*

Tony: When did you work it out?

Rhodey: What, the obvious fact that Peter is Spider-Man? Uh, almost as soon as he tried to lie about it. Frankly, I’m insulted that you didn’t just tell me. Pigeon Tony would have treated me with more respect.

Tony: It wasn’t my secret to tell — wait, what?"
