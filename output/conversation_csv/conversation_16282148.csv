0,16282148,Tony,Natasha,"Tony: The UN could surely look after a gaggle of heroes alone, right? It wasn’t like it was all that important that Tony was there to watch them sign the Sokovia Accords. *Tony thought it would have been better if he hadn’t shown up.*
Tony: The Sokovia Accords. The things that had caused all the trouble to start with. A sick feeling set in Tony’s stomach at the thought that he had caused a lot of the trouble. *Tony had recently worked so hard to get the rogue Avengers pardoned.*
Tony: But sitting in a room with his old friends, none of this seemed to make a difference. The mood was sullen and everyone sat with their shoulders squared as if they were ready to fight. *The four people in the room who were expected to sign the Accords all had unpleasant frowns on their faces.*
Tony: Tony was fairly sure the only reason they had even changed their mind was because he had gotten them pardoned and they were no longer fugitives. *Tony was fairly sure the only reason they had even changed their mind was because he had gotten them pardoned and they were no longer fugitives.*
Tony: Tony hated having the other Avengers back in the compound. He hated feeling so vulnerable. *Tony hated having the other Avengers back in the compound. He hated feeling so vulnerable.*
Tony: He hated that he was too scared to have Peter over, because he didn’t want them to meet him, but that meant spending less time with him. *He hated that he was too scared to have Peter over, because he didn’t want them to meet him, but that meant spending less time with him.*
Tony: He hated having more people living with him only to act like they weren’t there, to not talk to them, to still be just as alone. *He hated having more people living with him only to act like they weren’t there, to not talk to them, to still be just as alone.*
Tony: If he walked into a room with one of the rogues or one of them walked into a room he was in there would be silence after the obligatory “Hello”. *If he walked into a room with one of the rogues or one of them walked into a room he was in there would be silence after the obligatory “Hello”.*
Tony: The only people he talked to were Rhodey and Vision. Or Happy and Pepper on the off chance they were there. *The only people he talked to were Rhodey and Vision. Or Happy and Pepper on the off chance they were there.*
Tony: Steve and Natasha had attempted to talk to him the first night of their stay and that had been a disaster. *Steve and Natasha had attempted to talk to him the first night of their stay and that had been a disaster.*
Tony: Thinking of the others he frowned, he wasn’t going to be able to avoid them much longer. *Thinking of the others he frowned, he wasn’t going to be able to avoid them much longer.*
Tony: A meeting between the seven heroes at the compound had been scheduled so they could talk strategy and teamwork. *A meeting between the seven heroes at the compound had been scheduled so they could talk strategy and teamwork.*
Tony: He couldn’t help but wonder why he had gotten them all pardoned. Why he had thought it was a good idea to invite them all to his home. *He couldn’t help but wonder why he had gotten them all pardoned. Why he had thought it was a good idea to invite them all to his home.*
Tony: His phone buzzed, pulling him from his dread. He couldn’t help but grin when he saw the text. *His phone buzzed, pulling him from his dread. He couldn’t help but grin when he saw the text.*
Tony: Maybe he would be able to avoid the others for longer than he thought. *Maybe he would be able to avoid the others for longer than he thought.*
Natasha: Natasha wandered the compound. She worked hard to remember every twist and turn she took, to memorise the layout, as was a habit she had picked up in her years as an assassin. *Natasha wandered the compound. She worked hard to remember every twist and turn she took, to memorise the layout, as was a habit she had picked up in her years as an assassin.*
Natasha: She liked the building, liked what Tony had done. She was trying to find him, so maybe she’d tell him so. Probably not. *She liked the building, liked what Tony had done. She was trying to find him, so maybe she’d tell him so. Probably not.*"
1,16282148,Natasha,Tony,"Natasha: Maybe it would eventually lead to an apology from both parties. Because, contrary to what the others might believe Natasha had huge regrets in her actions at Leipzig. Not saving Steve and Bucky, she had to do that, she owed it to Steve. But the fact that she had to double cross to do it. She wanted more than anyone to bring the team back together, because, much like Tony, the Avengers were the closest thing she ever had to a family. So talking to Tony was her way to start bringing everyone closer. Not that she’d ever tell them that.

Natasha: His done really well. Great grades. A dinner celebration is in order. Just him, his aunt and me.
Tony: Wow, you are proud. Maybe you should hang his report card on the fridge.
Tony: The kid’s smart! He gets it from me.
Natasha: *starts to walk away, even though the conversation hadn’t finished. She wasn’t by any means an idiot. She was almost certain that Tony Stark didn’t have a child. She’d done more research into the man than anyone else and had never found out about any Stark spawn. She also knew better than anyone that meanings could be lost when you only heard part of a conversation, but she couldn’t think of any other reason Tony would even consider becoming close to a child. Maybe the Avengers weren’t the closest thing he had ever had to family. One meaning from the conversation was not lost to her. Rhodey had to cover for him at a ‘get together’ which could only mean Tony wouldn’t be going to the meeting. She stalked away from the room and without even realising it found herself back in the lounge room. The television was still on, but it now seemed to only be background noise to their conversation.*
Steve: We’re not the only ones in the wrong, but Tony won’t apologise until we do, so I suggest that we use this meeting to apologise to him.
Natasha: Good luck, considering he won’t be at the meeting."
2,16282148,Steve,Tony,"Steve: We’re not the only ones in the wrong, but Tony won’t apologise until we do, so I suggest that we use this meeting to apologise to him.
Nat: Good luck, considering he won’t be at the meeting.
Wanda: What?
Sam: Sounds like Stark’s got a son. A secret son. I bet I could find theories about it online.
Steve: It’s just not possible.
Wanda: Do you know about the boy, Vis?
Vision: Tony would prefer his identity is kept secret.
Tony: Tony, you know you can sit down.
Natasha: *Tony walked over and cautiously slid into the chair beside her.*
Sam: So, uh the compound is really nice. I like what you’ve done."
3,16282148,Sam,Tony,"Sam: So, uh the compound is really nice. I like what you’ve done.
Tony: *nodded* He didn’t know how to reply. He didn’t know where this was going. He didn’t like not knowing. He didn’t like feeling so out of place. He was used to it, especially in the last few weeks – in his own home – but he didn’t like it.
Sam: My room too. It’s really cool. Bigger than my one back in New York and Scotland. Though, you’ve put me so close to Steve I can hear his snoring some nights.
Tony: *grinned* It was, in truth, not really funny at all, perhaps it wasn’t even supposed to be. He didn’t know. But he could appreciate the attempt at humour. He liked that Sam was trying to lighten the mood. If he had to admit it he liked Sam, at least more so than the others at the moment. It was obvious that Sam was trying to make everyone more comfortable though he couldn’t understand why when they’d never been close in the first place, but he welcomed the attempt.
Tony: Good to hear. There’s always spare rooms if Capsicle gets too loud, *though he knew the man wouldn’t even consider a room change. Loyal to Steve until the end.*
Steve: God, I hate that damn nickname.
Nat: *decided to take the moment before anyone else could* Language, Captain.
Tony: *laughed*
Wanda: My room is nice too. Although, Vision still struggles with the concept of personal space, *smiling at Tony.*
Tony: There are some things that time can’t change.
Peter: *unknowingly pulled him from another Avenger-related situation he didn’t want to be in.*
Tony: *answered the phone* Hey kiddo, you good? You’re not injured are you? No. You need help with school work. I can do that. When’s it due? Perfect, we’ll work on it when I see you tomorrow…"
4,16282148,Tony,Rhodey,"Tony: He and Tony had only wanted to welcome newbies to the team and to make the world even safer. Because above all else that had always been Tony’s goal.
Rhodey: He could still see Tony throwing the weapons that belonged to his old friends. He could see the pain in his face and the anger and exhaustion that exuded from him. The breakdown as Tony ruined his training room in the absence of those he had trusted.
Rhodey: Rhodey sighed and took in a shaky breath. He returned to reality and looked at the room’s current state. The walls were once again lined with weapons and there was actually a decent amount of people using it, but Tony had yet to gain back his hopes for the Avengers initiative. He doubted that Tony would ever go looking for recruits again.
Steve: He also saw the exact moment Steve threw his shield straight into the wall, rather than the boards he had been aiming at. He cringed when he saw the plaster of the wall flying around.
Steve: Steve had spent the last hour throwing his shield at the metal boards in front of him and catching it as it hurtled through the air and back to him. It wasn’t even slightly enjoyable but it was easy to do without concentrating. And he was most definitely not concentrating, not on training at least.
Steve: His concentration was taken by the same thing it had been for weeks. He needed a good way to apologise to Tony. He needed to try and pull the team together again. And preferably along the way he figured out the mystery that was plaguing him. The identity of Tony’s son. How Tony had kept him secret, what he was like, how little Tony had trusted them. Rightfully, he reminded himself. He had lied, but apparently Tony had to.
Steve: His shield came flying back and he noticed just in time to ground himself and catch it. He let out a heavy sigh, his bout of frustration getting the better of him, and flung his shield off again. His wild throw, however, resulted in wild aim and he watched in slight horror as the shield slammed into the plaster wall and lodged itself there. He watched the wall crumple under the vibranium. He sighed again, this was really not the way to go when he wanted to be forgiven.
Steve: Out of the corner of his eye he saw the Iron Man armour retracting around Tony. He mentally prepared himself for any complaints he might receive, but all the genius did was walk over to his best friend and announce he was retiring from this training session. He seemed completely unbothered by the hole in his wall. And that bothered Steve.
Steve: Turning back to the wall he noticed a small robot speeding towards where his shield hung from the wall. It was a fairly generic looking robot, it was plain metal and had a basic face. Steve was unsure what exactly it was, robots weren’t exactly his forte, but the eyes on the robot’s face appeared to be cameras. Other than that it looked like the type of robot you would see on a child’s television show. It was wheels with a large rectangular body and a smaller rectangular head and there was a lengthy arm hanging off either side of it. It was also only about the height of Steve’s hip.
Steve: The bot came to a stop in front of the damaged wall and suddenly it was rising in height, small poles appearing and pushing it from the wheels. It extended an arm and pulled the shield from the wall, then dropped it carelessly to the side. Its body opened up and in a blur of too many limbs and some other odd looking contraptions it put the wall back together.
Steve: Steve stared in shock at the now unblemished wall, looking around he noticed two things. One: the robot had drawn the attention of the other Avengers and they were all look at the wall with varying degrees of shock (read: Nat seemed unbothered and Sam looked like he’d seen a ghost. But a cool ghost). Two: the entirety of the wall was undamaged, and he knew Wanda had been throwing things at it. He assumed this meant that the robot had been fixing it the whole time without them noticing.
Steve: Steve turned to congratulate Tony on the creation. It was admittedly impressive. Instead he saw Rhodey and Tony leaving the room, having a conversation a normal person wouldn’t have been able to hear.
Rhodey: “That’s a handy little machine,” Rhodey said, he didn’t sound all..."
5,16282148,Rhodey,Tony,"Steve: That’s a handy little machine. When did you make it?
Rhodey: Oh, I didn’t. My kid did.
Rhodey: Damn kid’s a genius.
Tony: Like I said, he gets it from me.

Steve: He’s got to be pretty old right? I mean he has a phone, plus, he made a robot, he can’t be a baby.
Sam: Which leads to the question: how did Tony keep him a secret this long? From the media. From the public. From us…
Natasha: Clint managed to do it. Don’t lie to yourself and say we always told each other everything.
Natasha: I’ve searched everywhere I can think of and there is no trace of this damn kid. It’s crazy! Tony hardly talks to us and everything about this is just awkward. It’s torturous.
Wanda: You guys know I can read minds, right? I could find out who it is.
Steve: No, we’re trying to win Tony’s trust back. Not make things worse."
6,16282148,Sam,Stark,"Sam: I want to talk to you, *he said*.
Stark: That's what teammates are for, *he replied*.
Sam: I know you probably don't trust me, hell I don't know if I trust you, but just know I got your back on the field, like you had mine. We aren't gonna let you die out there, and sorry if you thought we were. Because that's what teammates do, *Sam continued*.
Tony: Well, be warned, I'm a handful, Birdbrain, *he said*.
Sam: *They both laughed then*.

Sam: *As he nursed his cheek* Sam thought about the conversation of yesterday, it had been uncomfortable at the time, but he was proud of himself now. He even thought he'd be able to deal with Tony not apologizing. He looked around the room at the others, it was silent and he couldn't help but wonder how many of the others had apologized to each other. His train of thought was interrupted by the phone beside him ringing. He looked down and it took him a moment to realize it was Tony's phone. He didn't recognize the name of the person calling, but he did notice that Tony hadn't noticed the ringing.
Sam: Hey Tony, someone called May is ringing you, *Sam called out*, holding the phone out to Tony.
Rhodey: What have you done this time? *Rhodey laughed*.
Tony: *Tony swatted him over the head and walked over to Sam, plucked the phone out of his hand and answered immediately*. Hey May, what's up? He's not injured is he because if he is I will... Oh okay, he never mentioned it. Yeah, when is it? This Wednesday – I'll check… *Tony's voice drowned out as he walked from the room*.
Sam: *Sam looked around*, Wanda and Vision were still giggling with each other as though nothing had happened, Nat and Steve shared a significant look and Rhodey watched the confusion of Nat and Steve, and Sam himself too he supposed, with what appeared to be great amusement."
7,16282148,Wanda,Tony,"Wanda: Things are never going to get better if you keep walking out of every room I’m in.
Tony: *looked tired. But he looked very happy. And stunned.*
Wanda: *noticed the picture* Is that your son?
Tony: Uh, yeah?
Wanda: You seem confused.
Tony: He called me dad today.
Wanda: So? That’s what children normally call their fathers.
Tony: He’s not, uh, you know I’m not sure why I’m telling you this.
Wanda: Because you don’t want to tell anyone else?
Tony: Maybe it’s because I know you could find out anyway. He’s not mine, not biologically. He was just, well he was kind of an intern and, who knows why, but I took him under my wing and I guess we got close and he’s really important to me and I considered him mine, then today he called me dad. But I know it, god, you know it, I’m not fit to be a father, I can hardly deal with people my own age. What if I ruin him?
Wanda: *sighed* You know I never really liked you.
Tony: Great. Thanks.
Wanda: You didn’t let me finish. I don’t think I ever really gave myself the chance to like you. I got too caught up in Ultron and my parents. You locked me in the compound. I know you were trying to help me, but I didn’t like it. It still meant your first instinct was to protect, no matter how stupidly. Look, I don’t know why I’m telling you this Stark, but I am."
8,16282148,Wanda,Tony,"Wanda: I got too caught up in Ultron and my parents. You locked me in the compound. I know you were trying to help me, but I didn’t like it. It still meant your first instinct was to protect, no matter how stupidly. Look, I don’t know why I’m telling you this Stark, but I am. But if he’s decided that your good enough to be his dad, you’re probably doing something right. Also, I’m sorry. Sorry for fighting against you. I’m not sorry for trying to escape the compound, but I am sorry about the fight that it ended up as. And I am sorry for not signing the Accords, but they made me feel like a villain. They made me feel like a monster, like they were targeting me and I couldn’t be a hero. And when you spend so much time around the Avengers all you really want to be is a hero. Not an inferior.
Tony: Wow, that didn’t go where I expected it to. And I really hate heart to heart bullshit, but I think I gotta tell you that you’re not always going to feel like a hero. When I’m around the ever righteous Capsicle I feel like a fraud. Like I’m the worst, most selfish, cruel hero out there. So I get why you want to be looked at like you’re a hero. That’s what the kid makes me feel like, like I’m the best person he knows.
Tony: “Peter.”

Rhodey: Have any of you talked to Tony recently? He seemed really distracted this morning?
Wanda: His kid’s put a lot on his mind."
9,16282148,Happy,Tony,"Happy: You sure you want to go back to the compound? I thought we didn’t want Peter meeting the rogues.
Tony: They are out for the weekend. That’s what they said.
Peter: I’m going to punch Captain America.
Tony: What was that?
Peter: I said, the rain isn’t that bad, I still had a lot of fun today.
Tony: *raised an eyebrow and turned to him* What was that?
Peter: I said, the rain isn’t that bad, I still had a lot of fun today. *flashed an innocent smile and curled up, he rested his head on Tony’s shoulder*
Happy: *let out a bark of laughter* and Tony and wrapped an arm around him.

...

Unknown woman: Tony, I was just looking for you.
Tony: Uh huh, maybe he should listen.
Unknown woman: Listen I wanted to apologise. I mean, I have the whole time. But I’m sorry about the whole thing, and I plan to gain your trust back, no matter how- Are you even listening? she sounded annoyed."
10,16282148,Natasha,Tony,"Natasha: Tony, *clicks her fingers in front of his face* Aren't you supposed- why are you here?
Tony: I live here.
Natasha: No. Not this weekend. You are supposed to be at Barton's. All of you, you said you were going to be at Clint's for the weekend.
Tony: Dinner. We said we were going to his place for dinner. We ended up staying the night, but we never said we the weekend.
Natasha: Sam, Steve and Wanda are heading to the kitchen.
Tony: *drops his phone* This is not okay. *sprints to the kitchen*
Natasha: *runs off after him*

Peter: *notices the ex-rogue Avengers standing in the kitchen door*
Peter: *gets up and takes his plate over to the dishwasher*
*crash sound*
Peter: *spins around and stares at Captain America, Falcon, and Scarlet Witch lying on the ground, Black Widow standing in the doorway looking directly at him*
Peter: *grins*
Tony: *places a hand on Peter's shoulder* Sorry. This is Peter, my son. Pete this is Steve, Sam, Wanda and Nat.
Peter: You're not supposed to be here.
Tony: Funny story. They went to Clint's for dinner. Not the weekend.
Peter: *rolls his eyes*
Wanda: *smiles at the interaction*
Steve: Look son, we're friends of Tony's.
Peter: *swings his fist at Steve's face and punches him square on the nose*"
11,16282148,Steve,Tony,"Steve: Look son, we're friends of Tony's, *stepped forward*
Peter: *tilted his head and looked at him curiously. In an almost scrutinizing matter.*
Peter: *swung his fist at Steve's face and punched him square on the nose.*
Steve: *stumbled backwards, more out of surprise than force, and held his nose.*
Peter: You don't get to call yourself his friends. Friends don't leave each other for dead, *said darkly.*
Peter: *stared at his hand in shock.*
Tony: Holy shit. Holy shit, I wasn't expecting you to actually punch him. Jesus Christ, Pete.
Steve: *looked between the small child and Tony in surprise.*
Tony: *couldn't help but devolve into laughter.*
Natasha: *shot Tony somewhat disapproving glances.*
Tony: *could see Wanda trying to hold back a smile and Vision very openly grinning.*
Steve: *didn't know what was more surprising: that he had just been punched, that he had actually met Tony's son or that this was Tony's son.*
Steve: *looked at Peter in wide-eyed confusion.*
Sam: *began to laugh.*
Peter: *looked at Tony in wide-eyed confusion.*
Sam: Oh man. Not supposed to know? Kid, Tony is constantly bragging about his genius child. How were we supposed to not know?
Peter: *blushed.*
Tony: *pulled Peter into his side in a very protective manner.*
Tony: Well, this has been lovely. We're going to go hangout elsewhere. Enjoy the rest of your day.
Tony: *wished the day hadn't been rained out.*
Steve: *mumbled about being hit by a fifteen-year-old.*
Wanda: *watched the other three and felt odd knowing more about the situation than them.*
Wanda: You know, Peter isn't his biologically, *their eyes widened.*
Wanda: Tony got close with him through an internship. I think they're very cute though. Just like father and son anyway."
12,16282148,Nat,Tony,"Nat: Tony got close with him through an internship. I think they're very cute though. Just like father and son anyway. *closed her eyes for a moment, flooded with memories of how much she had enjoyed the playful arguments between her father and Pietro.*
Steve: *stood up*
Nat: *snatched his wrist before he could head to the door* Just leave them. I don't think Tony was ready for us to meet him.
Steve: *nodded*

Peter: *sat on his bed and curled the sheet in his hand*.
Peter: A year ago, the reason he wouldn't have been able to get rid of his smile was because he had met the Avengers, but now, it was because Tony had introduced him to the Avengers as his son. Tony bragged about him regularly. He couldn't believe this wasn't all some elaborate dream.
Peter: *knew he would be able to go to the compound more often again, since he had technically met the Avengers now. He had already decided he had to get to know them to make sure it was safe for his dad to be around them.*
Tony: *walked into his room and offered a smile* You alright, kiddo?
Peter: Extra.
Tony: Extra alright?
Peter: *laughed* Okay that didn't make any sense, but you know what I mean.
Tony: You punched Captain America. It felt good to watch.
Peter: It felt good to do. Anyway, we're even now. He punched me in Leipzig.
Tony: *smirked* HE WHAT?
Peter: *laughed and stood up, walked over to Tony and hugged him. Tight.* Thanks for today. I love you, Dad.
Tony: *heart got a bit faster and felt his hug get a bit tighter* I love you too, Son. *A pause* But not those pesky Avengers.
Both: *laughed*"
