0,16592630,Theseus Scamander,American auror,"Theseus Scamander: Theseus Scamander isn’t sure what he’s expecting when he’s told that there’s an American auror asking to see him – but it isn’t… this. For one, he was most definitely expecting a man. For two, man or not he wasn’t expecting someone carrying a cat basket. The woman stood in the Ministry’s main reception is tall, thin and angular, shaped like an ungainly willow tree, awkward shoulders stooped under the heavy leather trench coat he knows to be standard issue for his American counterparts. *describing the woman*

Theseus Scamander: Running administration for whatever one of Newt’s ridiculous exploits has brought an American auror carrying a shaking – and now occasionally hissing – cat basket into his path is not what Theseus considers to be a valuable use of his lunch hour. *describing the situation*

Theseus Scamander: Theseus helps a certain American auror deliver a strange beast to his brother, encounters the distinct and horrifying possibility that his brother has somehow attracted a girlfriend. *describing the events*

Theseus Scamander: I just couldn't get this cute little idea for Theseus and Leta meeting Tina for the first time out of my head. *explaining the inspiration for the story*"
1,16592630,Theseus,Newt,"Theseus: Ah... You were asking for me? *pauses three feet in front of her, eyebrows raised*
Woman: No. I wanted to see Mr Scamander.
Theseus: That's me, I'm afraid.
Woman: Oh. You're Theseus.
Theseus: Y-yes, I believe I just stated that -
Woman: I'm looking for Newt.
Theseus: Ah, the cat basket. Of course she's looking for his brother. Yes, he's around here somewhere - if you've brought him something you can leave it with me and I'll -
Woman: No, I think it's safer if I deliver this in person. I can wait.
Theseus: Very well. Let me see if I can track him down - ah, Leta?
Leta: You wouldn't happen to know where Newt is?
Theseus: In the postal department, compiling a report on the welfare of the owls.
Woman: Where's that?
Leta: We'll escort you.
Theseus: Running administration for whatever one of Newt's ridiculous exploits has brought an American auror carrying a shaking - and now occasionally hissing - cat basket into his path is not what Theseus considers to be a valuable use of his lunch hour. He's hungry. He wanted a sandwich and a cup of tea and the company of his fiancé, not to be running about the Ministry with a grumpy stranger and an unknown creature and - why is Leta looking smug, for heaven's sake?
Woman: Shh, *whispers to the cat basket*
Theseus: What - is that, exactly?
Woman: Nothing illegal.
Theseus: So - you know Newt...?"
2,16592630,Theseus,Woman,"Theseus: What – is that, exactly?
Woman: Nothing illegal.
Theseus: So – you know Newt…?
Leta: *jabs Theseus in the ribs*
Theseus: *grunts, rubbing the spot she poked* What is she trying to communicate to him?
Leta: *raises her eyebrows*
Leta: It’s Goldstein, isn’t it?
Woman: Yes.
Leta: Newt’s mentioned you.
Woman: He has?
Theseus: *perplexed* What on earth is going on? Who is this woman?
Newt: Tina!
Tina: Hello, Newt.
Newt: What are you –
Tina: I brought –
Both: *start at the same time and then stop*
Newt: You didn’t tell me you were…
Tina: I took an assignment in Paris but no one outside of my department is meant to know.
Tina: I couldn’t send ahead – but I found this little guy in the sewers and you’re the only person I could think of to –
Tina: *holds out the cat basket*
Newt: *leans down to peer into the cat basket* Is that a –
Tina: Chupacabra.
Tina: Male. Around three months old, I think, but he’s quite malnourished so –
Newt: *delighted* Merlin’s beard, what a handsome fellow.
Tina: Well, I’ve been feeding him up –
Newt: Crickets?
Tina: And ground up earth worms, to supplement the –
Newt: Goat’s blood?
Tina: Yes.
Newt: Excellent – very clever of you –
Tina: Well, I remember you saying how –
Newt: The extra protein –
Tina: And since he’s been separated from his mother so young –
Newt: You’ve kept him warm?
Tina: Of course –"
3,16592630,Theseus,Leta,"Theseus: Oh dear Lord, there's two of them. *pinches the bridge of his nose* Who is this woman?
Leta: He's never mentioned her to you? *squeezes his arm* She's the auror he met in New York. They've been writing to each other ever since he left.
Theseus: Newt! *steps forward* Would your friend and her - I'm sure perfectly legal - companion like to join you for lunch?
Newt: Are you asking Tina to lunch... for me?
Theseus: Well since she's come several hundred miles to bring you a Parisian sewer creature and you've been stood in this hallway for the last five minutes without so much as offering her a cup of tea...
Newt: Technically, the chupacabra is native to Puerto Rico. If Miss Goldstein found it without its mother it was most likely stolen and trafficked to Europe. Would you like a cup of tea, Tina?
Tina: Yes. Do you guys have hot dogs? They don't have them in France, it's driving me crazy.
Newt: Probably not, but we might be able to rustle you up a sausage roll.

Tina: He takes a half pint bottle of goat's blood first thing in the morning, *lays a notebook down on the table* and then ten crickets for lunch around midday - he likes 'em small though, anything bigger than about an inch and he gets scared and won't eat 'em - and blood worms for dinner. He prefers to have those frozen in little cubes not just scattered everywhere, or else they get away from him.
Newt: *listening with a wondering expression on his face, hands folded under his chin* Have you given him a name?
Tina: *hesitates, biting her lip* Elvis.
Newt: *glances up at her, unable to help a smile* He just kinda looks like one.
Tina: *shrugs sheepishly* Do you know, I think you're right?
Elvis: *protests his imprisonment, rattling the cat basket*
Tina: *leans down to tap the front of the basket* You be nice to Mr. Scamander. He's gonna take good care of you. I wouldn't leave you with just anyone, would I?
Elvis: *chatters back at her*
Tina: *makes a gentle clicking sound in the back of her throat* He seems very fond of you.
Newt: *observes gently* Yeah well, when your general experiences of humans is either 'the guy who ripped you away from your mom, shoved you in a crate and shipped you to France', or 'the girl who feeds..."
4,16592630,Tina,Newt,"Tina: He seems very fond of you.
Newt: I'll take the very best care of him that I can, Tina, you have my word.
Tina: Might miss the little guy some, though. Boarding house’s gonna be real quiet without him destroying the curtains in the middle of the night.
Newt: Well, you must come and visit him, then.
Tina: That’d be nice.
Tina: There's also the distinct advantage of being able to meet somewhere where my brother and his fiance won't be able to stare at us for the entirety of our time together.
Newt: *smiles* That - would be nicer.
Tina: Would you like to accompany Elvis to his new home?
Newt: You know him best, after all - you could help me set up his habitat to his satisfaction. If your work commitments allow for you to take another few hours, of course -
Tina: Yes, yes - I mean - I'm gonna miss all of today anyway, might as well see this the whole way through, you know?
Newt: Very sensible of you. No point wasting more time sitting about, I can make you better sandwiches at home than they have here anyway.
Tina: Newt?
Newt: Yes?
Tina: What the hell is a sausage roll, anyway?"
