0,16606967,Lily,James,"Lily: No.
James: You know why we are here, Harry, and you will do your duty to the wizarding world.
Harry: Why in the world would I help any of you people? I haven’t been a part of that world since I was a baby. Also, my name is not Harry, it’s Hadrian.
Lily: As if I would name my child such a pureblood name. Now, follow us and we will begin training you to defeat You-Know-Who.
James: What the bloody hell are you doing at my son’s house, Snivellus?! I bet you poisoned Harry against us, you Death Eater scum!
Severus: How can I help you today?
Lily: S-Sev, can we come in? We really need to talk to Harry, and maybe you and I can catch up.
Harry: I believe you have already received my answer to whatever you want to ask, and I certainly won’t let you steal my husband.
Harry: They finally left! Seriously, did they honestly think I wanted anything to do with them after they left me at an orphanage when I was 7? I can’t believe them."
1,16606967,Hadrian,Severus,"Hadrian: They finally left! Seriously, did they honestly think I wanted anything to do with them after they left me at an orphanage when I was 7? I can’t believe them. *fumed*
Severus: *chuckles* *pulls Hadrian into a warm hug*

Hadrian: Hadrian’s story began after he reached 11 years of age, when he received a letter to attend the Irish School of Magic, despite remembering his parents saying he wouldn’t be able to attend any school for magic. Apparently, after his twin brother, Alexander was claimed as the Boy-Who-Lived, there was no need for the other twin, according to Albus Too-Many-Names Dumbledore.
Severus: *no response*

Hadrian: He accepted the invitation to the Irish school and began attending the year-round school for 8 years, achieving a Mastery in enchantments and job offers from around the world. Hadrian decided to explore the world for a few years after graduating, and his desire was spurred on by the rumors of the resurrected Dark Lord.
Severus: *no response*

Hadrian: Two years ago, Hadrian heard an astonishing rumor that Alexander Potter had been defeated by the Dark Lord in a battle, causing many to lose hope in the Light side. The day after the battle, Rita Skeeter released an article proclaiming Alexander as the Boy-Who-Lied, stating that Dumbledore and the elder Potters lied to the public 20 years ago about who defeated the Dark Lord. They even finally admitted to the previously unknown existence of a second Potter child when reports started coming in about the Potters visiting different orphanages in Britain. The Potters also tried getting public sympathy by claiming they were looking for their lost son, Lily even ‘cried’ in public, asking for any information regarding ‘her poor, missing Harry’.
Severus: *no response*

Hadrian: Hadrian originally had no plans to return to England, but then he received a letter from Gringotts asking him to come in for a meeting regarding his inheritance. That meeting opened his eyes and led to Hadrian planning on how to destroy the Potters and Dumbledore. It also opened an opportunity for Hadrian to meet his future husband, one Severus Snape-Prince.
Severus: *no response*

Severus: Severus had achieved his Potions Mastery a few months after the fall of the Dark Lord. Contrary to what most of the citizens of Wizarding Britain believed, he did not actually serve as a Death Eater; in fact, he wasn’t even near the British Isles during the war against the Dark Lord. He had decided to earn his Mastery under a German Potions Master because of the issues in Britain.
Hadrian: *no response*

Severus: His cousin, Silas Prince, was the only Prince family member to serve under the Dark Lord. He was also the one who was charged and sentenced to Azkaban, and at his trial, he was proclaiming the Dark Lord was going to come back and kill every single ‘Mudblood and blood traitor’ and help cleanse the Wizarding World. Apparently, his actions got him a cell far away from Bellatrix Lestrange; the officials didn’t want the two feeding off each other and possibly colluding on escaping.
Hadrian: *no response*

Severus: Silas’ actions dragged the Prince name through the dirt along with the other pureblood supremacists. Fortunately for Severus, most of the globe’s population didn’t care for the insanity that was the British Wizarding World. However, unfortunately for him, Silas looked practically identical to Severus, and many people confused the two men during their times at Hogwarts despite their extremely different personalities. Silas was a typical pureblood: pompous, entitled, over-inflated, snobby personality and just a very unpleasant and smarmy man to be around. Severus, on the other hand, was just sullen and a loner, especially after Lily Evans dismissed him because of a word that was spoken in defensive anger. His Muggle upbringing distanced the young Snape from his cousin.
Hadrian: *no response*

Severus: Despite these differences, far too many people believed Severus was Silas during the war against Voldemort.
Hadrian: *no response*

Severus: *no response*"
2,16606967,Severus,Hadrian,"Severus: Hello, mind if I join you?
Severus: Ah, no, I don’t mind, there’s plenty of room.
Severus: *admiring the other male through the corners of his eyes*
Severus: *exchanging idle conversation*
Severus: *waiting for their meetings to begin*
Hadrian: *mourned his lost chance to continue talking with ‘Lord Peverell’*
Hadrian: *mourned the end to his delightful chat with ‘Lord Prince’*
Hadrian: *almost fainted when he was informed about the Lordship*
Hadrian: *decided to accept the Peverell Lordship*
Hadrian: *placed several restrictions on the Potter accounts*
Hadrian: *asked the goblins not to inform the Potter unless they came into Gringotts and asked about the new restrictions*"
3,16606967,Hadrian,Severus,"Hadrian: “Why won’ th’y ‘eave me al’ne? I ne’er did nothin’ to ‘em. None of ‘em ‘re e’en my type, and I ne’er showed interest in ‘ny of ‘em. No’ e’en P’tter…” *Severus’ words descended into mutterings again, this time completely unintelligible.*
Hadrian: *laying Severus down* “...make sure the older man doesn’t do anything dunderheaded in his drunken stupor.”
Severus: *smiling up at Hadrian*
Severus: “Quit da strugglin’ and ge’ ov’r ‘ere! I wanna snuggle wit’ some’ne…,” *the man grumbled before he lapsed once more into mumbles.*
Hadrian: *releasing a soft chuckle*"
4,16606967,Hadrian,Severus,"Hadrian: Come, love, let’s go enjoy ourselves now that the bothersome people are gone. Don’t worry, we’ll be leaving soon for our anniversary trip. *gives Severus a grin as he looked up at his taller love*
Severus: *returns the grin as he leaned down to kiss Hadrian*

Severus: Why in Merlin’s name are we going to the Wizengamot? The next meeting isn’t for another three months. *complained, although he would deny that he was whining*
Hadrian: *just chuckled and continued leading Severus into the Ministry*

Hadrian: I call on Tom Marvolo Riddle, Jr. as a member of My Family, and demand his presence before me. *intoned, causing everyone to freeze where they were, watching the strange man calling publicly for a family judgment*
Hadrian: As Lord Hadrian Peverell, Head of the Most Ancient and Most Noble House of Peverell, I hereby remove Tom Marvolo Riddle Jr. from my family. For betraying and attacking your own blood, I cast you out. For betraying the laws laid down by our ancestors, I remove your magic. And for attacking those you swore to protect as their Lord, I take your life. *each pronouncement, the snarling creature screamed and writhed in front of the entire Atrium. At the final pronouncement, the creature exploded into a cloud of black smoke that dispersed into nothingness*
Hadrian: Well, now that the pest has been handled, we can enjoy our holiday completely. Shall we? *presents his arm to escort Severus to the floo's*
Severus: *accepts after a few seconds of gaping at his husband*"
