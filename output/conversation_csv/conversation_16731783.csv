0,16731783,Draco,Harry,"James: What’s his name again?
Lily: Draco, isn’t it?
James: So what do we really know about this kid?
Lily: Harry only gave me the footnotes when he called.
James: So he’s a Slytherin, he’s Lucius Malfoy’s son and he hexed my kid. Remind me, why are we letting this boy in the house again?
Lily: You want to talk about pulling pigtails in the school-yard?
James: Cho Chang?
Lily: You just don’t like her because she said your chicken was a little dry."
1,16731783,James,Sirius,"James: That's all you've got for me? He's your cousin!
Sirius: Or nephew. Or something. I don't know what to tell you, Prongsy. I barely know him. Reg's the one who keeps up with that side of the family.
James: And what did your creepy little brother have to say about Draco Malfoy?
James: *Teddy gurgled urgently and toddled over to his father.* Sirius.
Remus: How many times... if you rile him up right before bed, he won't sleep all night.
Sirius: Sorry, love. *placating his husband with a sweet kiss and settling back down with the baby.*
Remus: Why the sudden interest in Draco Malfoy?
James: What, I'm not allowed to enquire about my son's former classmates or...
Remus: Prongs.
James: Fine. Harry's dating him and he's coming to dinner. I'm just trying to figure out this kid's deal. Did you know he used to hex Harry back at Hogwarts?
Remus: As far as I remember, Harry hexed him right back. Of course, I only taught them DADA for one term before I quit, but... they sort of reminded me of you and Lily at that age.
James: Wow. You two are no help at all.
Sirius: Reg did bring him up at dinner one time. He said he's alright. Which coming from him... well, you know.
James: It's not enough. Obviously, I'm going to have to crack this case myself.
Remus: Or, you could just get to know the boy with an open mind.
James: You don't know me at all, do you?
Sirius: Harry's got good instincts.
James: I'm going home. Got to take care of this.
Remus: He'll pull through.
Sirius: You have to admit, it's rough when your kids start dating.
Remus: Good thing that's a long, long way off for us."
2,16731783,Sirius,Teddy,"Sirius: He'll pull through, *chuckles* You have to admit, it's rough when your kids start dating.
Teddy: *cooed and planted a grubby hand on his cheek*
Sirius: *laughter trailed off into a soft smile* Good thing that's a long, long way off for us.

James: Dad! *exclaimed, heading straight for him* You made it!
Harry: *enveloped James in a crushing hug*
James: I missed you too, kiddo, *murmured, ruffling Harry's hair a bit*
Harry: Where have you been? We've been waiting ages.

James: *clears his throat and disentangled himself to peer over his son's shoulder*
Lily: *grinned and winked at James, before gesturing subtly to her right*
Draco Malfoy: Mr. Potter, *cleared his throat, stepped forward and extended his hand* It's an honour, sir. Harry's told me so much about you.

James: Malfoy, *intoned gruffly, when Lily raised a meaningful eyebrow at him* Welcome to our home.
Lily: It's so wonderful to finally meet you, Draco, *said, kind and trusting as always* We've been looking forward to this dinner all week.
Draco Malfoy: The pleasure's all mine, Mrs. Potter, *replied, bestowing another smooth, clearly practiced smile on Lily* If it's not too forward, I brought a little something for your table.

James: Interesting choice, *said stonily* I mean, lilies are a funeral flower.
Lily: *gave James a menacing look* Oh, you never know, darling, *said, light and breezy* They might just come in handy."
3,16731783,James,Malfoy,"James: So, Malfoy, what is it you do exactly?
Malfoy: I'm training to be a Curse Breaker, sir. I'm finishing my apprenticeship with the goblins next week, actually.
Harry: He's really good. Bill Weasley says he's a shoo-in for...
James: It's a noble profession. Funny, I had you figured for a politician. Like your old man.
Malfoy: That...was the plan for a long time. My father wanted me to follow in his footsteps and I didn't really see any reason not to."
4,16731783,Malfoy,Harry,"Malfoy: I had you figured for a politician. Like your old man.
Harry: Dad...
Malfoy: No, it's okay. *squeezing his hand gently* That... was the plan for a long time. My father wanted me to follow in his footsteps and I didn't really see any reason not to.
Lily: What made you change your mind?
Malfoy: *smiling faintly and turning to Harry* He did. Harry's always so... he just does what makes him happy. He could have been an Auror like you, Mr. Potter. It would have been safe, sensible thing to do. *glancing briefly at James* But he wanted to work with Magical Creatures, so that's what he did. Honestly, I thought he was mad but... I realized that he'd inspired me. Harry made me want to find my own way. He showed me that I didn't have to be what was expected of me. So, after a bit of soul searching, I told my parents I was going to be a Curse Breaker and that was it. Of course, Father was not happy but... I am. *smiling widely and bussing a kiss to Harry's cheek* I couldn't be happier.
Harry: *staring at his boyfriend with wide, shining eyes* You never told me any of that.
Malfoy: *managing a sheepish grin* Come here.
Lily: *sniffing and dabbing her eyes* *giving James a watery smile and gesturing to them*
James: *draining the rest of his wine and standing up* I'm going to get some air.
Harry: *breaking away from Malfoy and blinking at him* Dad?
James: *already out the door*"
5,16731783,Draco,James,"Draco: “I think…I think I had this idea of you and I just ran with it.”
James: “You thought I’d be more like my father.”
Draco: “If it helps, sir, you’re not the first.”
James: “Look, kid. I don’t mean to go after your old man. It’s just…”
Draco: “I understand. My family can be…and yours is…I suppose it was too much to ask to get along right from the start. Maybe we just need to spend more time together?”
James: *shrugs*
Draco: “Look, Mr. Potter. I realise you might not want to hear this right now, but I think it’s important for you to know. Harry…he’s my everything. He means the world to me and — assuming that he’s alright with it — I plan to spend the rest of my life with him. So, I would strongly suggest that you get used to me because…well, I’m not going anywhere.”
James: *nods firmly* “If you ever hurt my son, I will hunt you down.”
Draco: *cracks a smile* “Duly noted, sir.”

James: *withdraws and reaches out to tune the wireless*
James: “I assume you have the good sense to support Puddlemere United?”
Draco: “Who else would I support?”
James: “The Arrows? Or Merlin forbid, the Chudley Cannons?”
Draco: “Harry likes the Cannons.”
James: “And I love him despite that. It’s all Ron Weasley’s fault, you know. He’s a terrible influence on your son.”
James: *laughs*
Draco: *laughs*
James: *shushes Draco and holds up the wireless*
Draco: *shuffles closer*
James: “They’ve spotted the Snitch!”
Draco: *howls in excitement*
James: *whoops*
Draco: *joins in cheering*

Harry: “What’s Dad’s problem?”
Lily: “Oh, sweetheart, I’m sorry tonight didn’t go the way you wanted.”"
6,16731783,Lily,Harry,"Lily: You're his baby boy. As far as your Dad's concerned, nobody could ever be good enough for you. You could have brought home Celestina Warbeck and he'd still find something to complain about.
Harry: Really? Celestina Warbeck. That's the bar then, is it?
Lily: You know what I mean.
Harry: I know. Is it... is it because Draco's a man?
Lily: No, Harry. Never. You're our son and we love you no matter what. If you're happy, if you love him and he makes you happy... then we love him. It might take your Dad a while to get there, but he will get there. I promise.
Harry: I do love him, you know.
Lily: I know, sweetheart. He's polite, charming, sweet and he likes my cooking. Trust me, we're keeping this one.
Harry: I just wanted you and Dad to like him too. You do, right?
Lily: *presses a kiss to his forehead*
Lily: He's polite, charming, sweet and he likes my cooking. Trust me, we're keeping this one.
Harry: *pulls her into a tight hug*
Lily: *gives him a reassuring squeeze before pulling away*
Lily: Now, let's go find them, hm? I think a little dessert is just the thing to pull this party back together.
Harry: Yeah. Yeah, okay. I think they're outside...

James: What did I tell you?
Draco: Salazar, did you hear the crowd? That had to be a new world record!
James: *throws an arm around Draco's shoulders* You're alright, kid. Say, did you play back at school?
Draco: Seeker, yeah!
James: Me too!
Draco: I'm out of practice though. Father thinks Quidditch is for plebians and vagabonds...
James: Harry hates it too! Go figure!
Harry: I do not hate Quidditch. I'm just not a lunatic about it like some...
Lily: *waves a hand to shush him*
Lily: Just let it play out, baby. Just... let them go.
James: I've got a couple brooms in the shed. You ever played Seeker's Tag on a Firebolt?
Draco: You have a Firebolt?!
Harry: *mumbles* Quidditch. How could I have missed...? I knew what Dad was like about the sport. And Draco honestly scared me."
7,16731783,James,Draco,"James: You ever played Seeker's Tag on a Firebolt?
Draco: You have a Firebolt?!
Lily: Let's get you some pudding. And we'll make a plate for your father and his new best friend too.
James: Hey, son! Merlin, you look awful. Are you getting enough sleep?
Harry: Dad, it's Saturday.
Harry: Save it. I know you're not calling for me.
Harry: Draco! It's for you!
Draco: I'm all set.
James: So what are you waiting for, an engraved invitation? Get over here, son!
Draco: I'll be back soon. Go back to bed, you look exhausted.
Harry: If you don't return my boyfriend in two hours, I'm calling Mum. And I will tell her about the window you broke.
Harry: Yeah yeah, two hours. Merlin, you're just like your mother with the nagging...
Harry: If you don't return my boyfriend in two hours, I'm calling Mum. And I will tell her about the window you broke.
James: Yeah yeah, two hours. Merlin, you're just like your mother with the nagging...
Harry: If you don't return my boyfriend in two hours, I'm calling Mum. And I will tell her about the window you broke.
James: Yeah yeah, two hours. Merlin, you're just like your mother with the nagging..."
