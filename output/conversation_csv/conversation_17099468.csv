0,17099468,Steve,Winter Soldier,"Steve: I think I'm ready to date again.
Natasha: What?
Clint: What? *lowering his binoculars* What? *blinked at the dumbstruck look on the Captain's face* Steve, no.
Steve: *courts the Winter Soldier*"
1,17099468,Steve,Stephanie,"Steve: Chicken not good?
Stephanie: Listen, Steve—
Steve: You’re a nice enough guy. You’re just a little—um.
Stephanie: Boring.
Steve: Yes!
Stephanie: Wait, no. I mean—I just thought you would be more—adventurous. And, I mean, you’re kind of, uh—have you ever heard of Eeyore?
Steve: Yes.
Stephanie: Winnie the Pooh is that old, huh?
Steve: Right.
Stephanie: I’ll just Venmo you for the meal, okay?
Steve: Right, he said, again."
2,17099468,Clint,Natasha,"Clint: Hey.
Natasha: Yo.
Clint: Peanut?
Natasha: I'll take one.
Clint: *lowered his binoculars* Cap! Hey, hello. Hi there.
Steve: *lifted his eyebrows* Cap! Hey, hello. Hi there.
Clint: *signed* I thought this was supposed to be reconnaissance. What's with the red, white, and blue?
Natasha: *signed back* Look at him.
Clint: *looked at Steve* What the hell happened?
Clint: *signed* Sorry, Cap. You just don't come out for reconnaissance that often.
Steve: What are we looking at?
Clint: We are monitoring a tracksuited gang of unspecified Eurasian origin.
Natasha: The Russian mafia.
Clint: Unspecified Eurasian origin.
Steve: Well, I see someone down there, but he's definitely not wearing a tracksuit.
Natasha: *burst into a colorful flurry of Russian*
Steve: Natasha, language.
Clint: What did she say?
Natasha: The pakhan isn't here yet, you asshole!
Natasha: *clicked her tongue* He's going to ruin everything.
Natasha: He's freelance. Not much is known about him, except that he's been credited with over two dozen high profile kills over the span of fifty years—for the wrong team—before he went offline in the early 2000s. He only reappeared five years ago to lay waste to several active HYDRA bases, before he started taking contracts from anyone who paid high enough. Anyone.
Clint: *took the binoculars from Natasha*"
3,17099468,Clint,Natasha,"Clint: Give me those, *taking the binoculars from Natasha.*
Clint: Woah. *stumbled back a step* Who did you say he is?
Natasha: He, *icily* is the Winter Soldier. I hope you weren't attached to any of those men, since there won't be much left of them after the Soldier is done.
Steve: I think I'm ready to date again.
Natasha: What?
Clint: Steve, no.
Natasha: Whatever happened to Stephanie? Stephanie was nice. You and Stephanie were good together.
Steve: She dumped me. I was too boring for her.
Clint: Boring?
Natasha: Someone called you boring. So you want to-date the Winter Soldier?
Steve: I know it sounds crazy, but... Have you ever looked into someone's eyes and just-knew?
Natasha: No.
Steve: Right, yeah.
Natasha: That saying usually applies to people who aren't international assassins. Which, as it turns out, also applies to the Winter Soldier.
Clint: Hold on, hold on. Maybe my hearing aids are acting up but-but did you just say someone dumped you because you're boring? You're Captain America! You-ow, Natasha, wtf?
Natasha: First of all, never say 'wtf' in my presence ever again. Second of all-
Steve: I'm not Captain America.
Clint: I'm not always Captain America. People find Steve Rogers boring.
Clint: Aw, Cap, no."
4,17099468,Clint,Cap,"Clint: Aw, Cap, no.
Natasha: Literally anyone. That nurse you used to live down the hall from. She’s cute, and I bet she wouldn’t say no if you asked her out on a date.
Steve: Steve, you have no idea what he’s done—or what he’s willing to do. Did you miss the part where I said he was on the wrong side? Because he was. For years.
Steve: So were you. So was I, for that matter. Sounds to me like he got himself out of it and is now trying to make amends for his past.
Clint: So—what, so you’re just down for anyone who likes to beat up Nazis? Do you even like men or is it just a Nazi-punching thi—ow, Natasha. I don't have a problem with it, I'm just wondering if he's got a kink—ow!
Steve: Nazi-punching is a major turn on.
Natasha: Fine. Whatever. Make terrible life choices. Don’t come crying to me when they come back to shoot you in the ass.
Steve: FRIDAY, what can you tell me about the current movements of Codename: Winter Soldier?
FRIDAY: The Winter Soldier placed the equivalent of a billboard advertising his rates in the dark web three and a half days ago. He participated in a brief bidding war, and then was hired by a gentleman named Mikhail Mikhailov, who has some issues with the Russian mafia.
Steve: Can you give me his exact coordinates?
FRIDAY: As it turns out, I can. Black Widow had requested my assistance in monitoring the mafia several weeks ago. As long as he hasn’t damaged my bugs—ah, there he is."
5,17099468,Widow,Cap,"Widow: Whatever you're thinking, stop.
Widow: I reiterate, stop.
Cap: That's quitter talk.

Cap: Hey, Murad.
Murad: The usual?
Cap: Murad, what do you get an international assassin as a gift?
Murad: A number one with a side of fries.

Cap: Then I'll take a number one with fries.
Murad: Excellent choice. Finally putting the moves on the Black Widow, eh? Good for you. Personally, she scares the hell out of me, but good for..."
6,17099468,Steve,Murad,"Steve: Then I'll take a number one with fries.
Murad: Excellent choice. Finally putting the moves on the Black Widow, eh? Good for you. Personally, she scares the hell out of me, but good for you.
Steve: Thanks, Murad.
Murad: Let me know how it goes, boss!
Steve: Sorry, sorry. I didn't mean to startle you. I come bearing falafels.
Steve: I mean, you must be hungry, right? I can't imagine being out here for hours without taking a break to eat. Then again, I need to fuel up often and with great excess. Metabolism like a cheetah, so I'm told. I used to not require as much food, but... Right, yeah, you really don't need to know my entire life story, sorry.
Steve: It's not poisoned. No, seriously! I wouldn't do something like that. Do... uh, do you want me to try some, to prove it to you? Only, if you're going to chuck it because of my big stupid mouth, please don't—that would be wasteful.
Steve: It's delicious.
Steve: Oh! Oh, of course. You're not going to take your mask..."
7,17099468,Steve,The Soldier,"Steve: It’s delicious, *encouragingly*
The Soldier: *stares at him*
Steve: *beams*
Steve: Oh! Oh, of course. You’re not going to take your mask off in front of me to eat. *coughs into his fist, heat prickling up the back of his neck* Right. Well, I hope you enjoy! *dorky little wave* *turns on his heel and beat a strategic retreat off the edge of the roof*
The Soldier: *watches the blond man walk away*
The Soldier: *lowers his mask* *takes a falafel between metal fingers and pops the whole thing in his mouth* Weird kid, but he was right: the food was fucking delicious.

Clint: He’s probably forgot all about him, *optimistically*
Natasha: *shifts the greasy bag of Chinese food into her other hand* You clearly don’t know Steve like I do.
Clint: Are you breaking into Steve’s floor? *scandalized*
Natasha: Yes. *the door swishes open*
Clint: I’m just saying, he’s only seen the guy twice, for like, two minutes. I wouldn’t be surprised if he— *freezes*
Steve: *seated at his kitchen table, loose sheaves of printed out blog posts spread out in front of him, a laptop open to his left* Oh my god, *Clint said* What are you doing?
Steve: *quickly snaps the book shut, hiding the cover with his hand* Clint, Natasha. This isn’t what it looks like.
Natasha: It looks like you cleared out the entire romance section of The Strand.
Steve: Not the entire section, *protests*
Clint: *lifts his eyebrows* Faking It?
Steve: I think that one is about a fake relationship, *he said* It seems to be a theme in a lot of these books.
Clint: *smirks*"
8,17099468,Clint,Steve,"Clint: I think that one is about a fake relationship. It seems to be a theme in a lot of these books.
Steve: Either that, or it's about faking orgasms. It's a trope. *waves a hand at a spiral notebook, where he was, apparently, taking notes on romance novel tropes.*
Natasha: Are you also taking notes on how many times the words 'moist' and 'shaft' have been used?
Steve: 'And 'velvet',' said Steve, refusing to blush, although Clint physically recoiled at the word 'moist.' 'Throbbing manhood' is a personal favorite.
Natasha: Steve, what are you doing?
Steve: Studying.
Clint: This is planning?
Steve: It's research. There's a lot of modern literature around courtship. It's been very helpful.
Natasha: You might get stabbed for it, but you'll manage.
Steve: *flashes a toothy grin at her, then steals her carton of fried rice.*
Clint: So, with all your 'research', what's your brilliant plan?
Steve: I was thinking about getting him a gun.
Natasha: What, because he doesn't have enough ways to violently murder you? What kind of books are these, anyway? I refuse to believe you got this brilliant idea from Faking It.
FRIDAY: It makes the most logical sense.
Clint: Listen, as the only one in the room with actual romantic experience—
Natasha: You're divorced.
Clint: —take my advice and get him something he can't kill you with, like chocolates.
Natasha: *shrugs*
Steve: Yep. *pours the rest of the fried rice directly into his mouth*
Natasha: What are you going to do if he agrees to a date? You can't exactly take..."
9,17099468,Natasha,Steve,"Natasha: He can actually kill you with chocolate. What can’t he kill you with?” *Natasha shrugged*
Natasha: “Are you sure you want to date this guy, Cap?”
Steve: Yep. *Steve pouring the rest of the fried rice directly into his mouth*
Natasha: “What are you going to do if he agrees to a date? You can’t exactly take him to the movies,” *Natasha leaned forward, resting one arm on the table.*
Clint: *Clint was immediately bombarded with the image of Captain America sitting next to the Winter Soldier in a movie theater, both in full combat gear, the Captain offering the Soldier some popcorn, “or to dinner.”*
Clint: *And Clint’s mental image shifted to the two of them sitting across from each other in a fancy restaurant, the Soldier staring stoically down at his steak and potatoes, like he could will his food directly into his stomach.*
Clint: *It was too much for him. He laughed.*
Steve: *Steve didn’t even look up from the carton of dumplings he was rapidly demolishing when he threw Faking It at Clint’s chest.*
Steve: “I’ll figure it out,” *Steve said, with the stubborn conviction of a man who had no idea what he was getting himself into.* “For now, I just need to figure out how to get him to actually agree to go on a date with me.”
Clint: “Offer him your throbbing manhood,” *Clint muttered, then yelped when Steve kicked him on the shin.*

The Soldier: *The Soldier adjusted his rifle. He zoomed in on the blond man gently terrorizing a convenience store clerk.*
The Soldier: *The Soldier exhaled a long breath. Depressed his finger on the trigger.*
Unknown character: *A hand fell heavy on the Soldier’s shoulder.* “Well well well, if it isn’t my old friend the Winter Soldier. What are we doing out here, eh?”
The Soldier: *The Soldier looked down at the hand. It was encased in a metal exoskeleton, humming with power. Strong. Held the Soldier’s arm firmly in place.*
The Soldier: *The Soldier wrenched back. Metal ground against metal. He pivoted around and ripped out the pistol from his thigh holster, all in one fluid movement.*
Crossbones: *Crossbones grinned at him. He wasn’t wearing his mask. The smile creased and pocked the ruin of his cheek.*
The Soldier: *The Soldier examined the side of Crossbones’ face.* “Ouch,” *he said.*
Crossbones: *The scar tissue on Crossbones’ face tightened into a sneer. He reached out one power-fist and grabbed the front of the Soldier’s shirt.* “You did this to me,” *he snarled.*
The Soldier: *He had. He had dropped a building on Crossbones’ head. He would drop two more buildings on Crossbones’ head without a second thought.*
The Soldier: *He was just about to unload his gun into the unscarred side of Crossbones’ face when something exploded against the back of Crossbones’ head, startling him enough to release the Soldier’s shirt. Quick as a viper, the Soldier wrapped his left hand around Crossbones’ neck and pressed his gun against his temple.*
Unknown character: *The Soldier glanced down to see what had hit Crossbones. Little creamy brown squares were scattered around their feet. The Soldier nudged one with his toe.* It was chocolate.
Blond man: “Are you okay?” *the blond man with the falafels asked, jogging up to the Soldier.*
Crossbones: *Crossbones gurgled.*
The Soldier: *Without taking his eyes off the newcomer, the Soldier applied slightly more pressure to Crossbones’ neck. A warning.*
Blond man: *There were several ways he could terminate both Crossbones and the man, if the man attempted to rescue Crossbones. But the blond just watched him with a carefully neutral expression, no judgement in his kind blue eyes.* “He’s HYDRA, right?” *The Soldier’s hand spasmed. Crossbones tried to suck in a wheezing breath. The Soldier ground the muzzle of his gun harder into Crossbones’ temple, but he did not squeeze the trigger.*
Blond man: “If you want,” *the blond said, calmly,* “I know some people. I can guarantee that he’ll never see the light of day again.” *He shrugged one shoulder.* “It"
10,17099468,The Soldier,Crossbones,"The Soldier: RA, right?” *The Soldier's hand spasmed. Crossbones tried to suck in a wheezing breath. The Soldier ground the muzzle of his gun harder into Crossbones' temple, but he did not squeeze the trigger.* If you want, I know some people. I can guarantee that he'll never see the light of day again. *He shrugged one shoulder.* It's up to you.
Crossbones: *Crossbones scowled back out of the corner of his eye, hateful.*
The Soldier: *The Soldier glanced at the blond man, but there was nothing to guide him in those blue eyes.* Unclenching his fingers, the Soldier released Crossbones. He landed hard, gasping, and rolled over onto his back, but before he could get to his feet again, the blond put a foot on his face. I wouldn't do that if I were you, the blond said, pleasantly.
The Soldier: *The Soldier sank back on his heels, silently observing the interaction. Crossbones had immediately stilled under the blond man's foot, not even attempting to fight. There was more to the blond man than the Soldier had first surmised.* A threat? But then, why the falafels?
The Soldier: *The Soldier stumbled back, eyes widening. Then he snatched the bar of chocolate out of the blond's hand, turned on his heel, and sprinted away.*
The Soldier: *The Soldier sat on his apartment's fire escape, cross-legged, in a pair of old sweats and a T-shirt, hair swept back in a low tail. With his metal hand, he tore the bar of chocolate in half, not even bothering to peel off the paper. He broke off a small square and popped it in his mouth, then closed his eyes, letting the milky-sweet chocolate melt on his tongue for a second. Then he bit into it. It crunched with toffee.* My favorite, he thought, and then deliberately did not think again. He stared into the street below, eyes unfocused. Soon, the daily chatter of the city died down as people made their way indoors. Warm yellow lights flickered on in nearby windows. Occasionally, a figure moved within his sight line, an easy target. The Soldier got to his feet. He required more intel.
Natasha: *Natasha would rather die than admit it out loud, but the Winter Soldier scared the fuck out of her. Before, when he was the asset, he was a mindless, ruthless killing machine that stopped at nothing to get his job done, that was a 'that' instead of a 'who.' Then he had gotten out, and the ruin he had left in his wake—it stayed with a person. And while he seemed less inclined to shoot through her to get to his target these days, he still had that fixed look more suited for a reptile on the hunt than a functional human being.* So when he showed up at her window, unannounced, in the middle of the night, she did what any sane person would do: she shot him.
Natasha: No? So it's a courtesy call, then."
11,17099468,Widow,Cap,"Widow: Your boyfriend visited me last night. *She hadn’t even realized he had it pointed at her, Jesus.* I shot him, but he’s okay.
Cap: *frowned down at his phone, not stopping to type out his response.* Stop shooting him.
Widow: Only if he stops breaking into my apartment.
Cap: Why did he break into your apartment?
Steve: *When she didn’t respond right away, Steve called her, but of course she didn’t pick up.* Likely the Soldier had gone to Natasha to gather more intel. He hoped she only said good things about him.
Steve: *On mornings like this, brisk and with a chilly wind, Bucky used to bundle them both up and and drag Steve all around the city. He had liked the way the girls looked in their long coats and fur stoles, and how their skirts swirled around their calves. Steve had liked the way the crisp air made Bucky’s cheeks pink up and how his eyes glowed with happiness.* Two women hurried past Steve now, but they were dressed in huge puffy jackets, with thick beanies pulled low over their ears and scarves wound around the lower halves of their faces, and were hunched up against the wind.
Steve: *Well. Maybe it was colder than he realized. Sometimes, it was hard to tell with this big body of his. His temperature just auto-regulated these days.* Washington Square Park was quiet for a Saturday; even the man who normally played piano near the Arch had apparently decided to stay indoors today. Steve slid his hands into his pockets, contemplating his next steps. The Soldier had accepted Steve’s gifts, but Steve wasn’t entirely sure he understood the context of the gifts. He needed to—
Winter Soldier: *Something slammed violently into his back, hard enough to send him sprawling onto the pavement. He landed on his shoulder, and was just about to shove himself back to his feet when the Winter Soldier strode up to him.*"
12,17099468,Steve,Winter Soldier,"Steve: Oof.
Winter Soldier: I seem to have acquired a superhero stalker. *standing on top of Steve like he was a throw rug*
Steve: I'm not stalking you. *told the pavement*
Winter Soldier: The falafel, saving me from Crossbones, which I didn't need by the way. The chocolate. If you're not stalking me, what are you doing.
Steve: Uh.
Winter Soldier: Well?
Steve: I was kind of—trying to maybe court you? *voice ticking up into a question*
Winter Soldier: What.
Steve: I mean, I don't know what people call it these days. Woo you? Date you?
Winter Soldier: You don't know nothing about me, sweetheart.
Steve: Isn't that why you go on dates? To get to know the other person?
*pregnant silence*
Steve: I need help flirting.
Clint: Oh, oh, hit him with this line: girl, did you fall out of a tree? Because you look like a finecone.
Steve: I need help flirting.
FRIDAY: No.
Steve: I need help flirting.
Natasha: If you call me at one a.m. with your self-inflicted drama again I will kill you."
13,17099468,Steve,Natasha,"Steve: I need help flirting, Steve said, into his phone.
Natasha: If you call me at one a.m. with your self-inflicted drama again I will kill you, Natasha said, and hung up on him.
Sam: The world better be fucking ending, Sam muttered, swinging his legs off the side of his bed, bare feet slapping against cold wood floor. He grabbed his phone from where it had landed by his bedroom door and glared down at the screen.
Sam: Lord preserve me, Sam muttered. He shot back a text to Steve telling him to tucking google it, then he dropped his phone back to the floor and crawled back into his bed.
Steve: You are not allowed to tell anyone you caught me doing that, Steve said, into his phone.
FRIDAY: I wouldn’t tell anyone I caught you practicing pick up lines in your bathroom mirror, FRIDAY said, offended. I would show them the video I recorded.
Steve: Tony programmed way too much of his personality into you, Steve muttered.
Steve: Where did you say he was last spotted?
FRIDAY: The Winter Soldier was last seen leaving Russ & Daughters.
Steve: You’re sure he’s here? Steve asked.
FRIDAY: No, I’m not sure. I just had real-time footage of the Winter Soldier leaving the cafe transmitted to me from an ARGUS satellite. I suppose it is possible that the military-grade tech was mistaken, however.
Steve: Did Tony program you to be this sarcastic or did you evolve?
Steve: Hey! Steve shouted, waving both his hands at the Soldier.
The Soldier: *closed his eyes, pained, as Steve jogged across the street, dodging incoming vehicles like a pro.*
Steve: Be cool, Steve told himself. Hey! Steve shouted, waving both his hands at the Soldier."
14,17099468,Steve,Soldier,"Steve: Hey.
Soldier: What are you doing.
Steve: Being seductive. Is it working?
Soldier: No, I am not seduced.
Steve: I was looking deeply into your eyes. I wasn't trying to challenge you.
Soldier: Next time, stick with falafels.

Steve: Hey, Murad.
Murad: Oh, I was about to beat my high score.
Steve: Sorry about that.
Murad: Captain Rogers! You're too kind.
Steve: I don't get cold easily.
Murad: Super soldiers. Next time you see one of your fancy scientists, hook me up with some of that super juice, okay?
Steve: Jury's still out, but the verdict is looking promising. Actually, what was that you suggested last time? A number one with fries?"
15,17099468,Murad,Steve,"Murad: Well? How goes your courtship of the international assassin? Have you won her over yet?
Steve: Jury’s still out, but the verdict is looking promising. Actually, what was that you suggested last time? A number one with fries?
Murad: What did I say, eh? Works every time. Tell you what—this one is on the house. If this doesn’t seal the deal, you have her come to me and I’ll talk to her, okay?



Steve: Oh!
Soldier: *cocked an expectant eyebrow*

Steve: I have more falafels, *holding out the paper bag*

Soldier: *takes the bag*



Steve: Yes, FRIDAY?
FRIDAY: I believe the Soldier is calling you.
Steve: What do you mean?
FRIDAY: He’s been staring at one of my bugs for the past five minutes.
Steve: What? Where is he? Is he still there?

FRIDAY: He’s in Bed Stuy at a bar called Swell Dive.
Steve: Can I borrow one of the quinjets?
FRIDAY: Absolutely not.

Steve: *takes his bike instead of risking the notoriously unpredictable subway*

Steve: *double-parked his bike next to a beater car in front of Swell Dive, shaking off the snow he'd collected from his drive, and slammed into the bar.*"
16,17099468,Captain America,Winter Soldier,"Steve: Is that Captain America?
Crowd: Holy shit, are we under attack? In this weather?
Steve: Sorry, sorry. *plastering on his best Captain America smile*
Steve: The Winter Soldier wasn’t skulking at any of the booths or at the foosball table tucked away in the corner.
Steve: So, with a parting wave and a 'Support Your Country' grin, he pivoted on his heel and slammed his way back outside.
Steve: The Soldier also wasn’t in front of the bar, nor was he inside any of the cars lining the streets, nor hiding behind a dumpster in any of the nearby alleys.
Steve: Defeated, Steve shoved his hands in his pockets and made his way back to his bike, kicking a pebble.
Steve: As offensive as it was, Clint had a point when he said the Soldier liked to creep around in high places.
Steve: Well, it was worth a shot. *Steve leaped up, catching hold of the fire escape's second floor landing, and hauled himself up.*
Steve: The Winter Soldier was not on the roof, but he had left something for Steve by the access door.
Steve: A knife was driven deep into the brick wall, pinning up a white paper bag.
Steve: Steve tested the handle of the knife. It didn't budge.
Steve: He whistled under his breath, calculating the amount of force required to stab into a brick wall.
Steve: This casual display of strength was—pretty hot, actually.
Steve: Steve tore the bag away from the wall, peering inside of it.
Steve: Apparently, the Winter Soldier had gotten him tacos.
Steve: Steve closed the bag again and scanned the nearby rooftops.
Steve: The Winter Soldier was on the roof of the building across the street, head tilted to the side, like a cat watching to see how his gift was received.
Steve: Thank you! *Steve shouted.*
Winter Soldier: *The Soldier tipped his head in a nod of acknowledgement.*
Steve: *Steve tucked the bag under his arm, careful not to crush the food, and cupped his mouth with both his hands.* I think you have beautiful eyes!
Winter Soldier: *The Soldier pinched the bridge of his nose.*
Steve: Your hair is great, too!
Winter Soldier: Eat your fucking tacos! *the Soldier shouted, then made a disgusted noise and disappeared off the side of the roof.*
Winter Soldier: *The next morning, the Soldier received a text message from Mikhail Mikhailov, wondering why the fuck Kazi is still alive.*
Winter Soldier: *The Soldier clicked his tongue and slipped his phone into his back pocket.*
Winter Soldier: *He was letting himself get distracted. Sloppy.*
Winter Soldier: *But for the first time in his current memory, the Soldier was—curious.*
Winter Soldier: *He was drawn to the blond man and his clumsy attempts to get his attention.*
Winter Soldier: *He wanted to continue playing this strange game, and it had been a long time since he wanted anything.*
Winter Soldier: *The Soldier couldn't bring himself to stop these daily interactions, even if it was beginning to negatively impact his job.*
Winter Soldier: *But he did have a job to do, so that day he did not seek out the blond man, nor did he try to get his attention through one of the many Stark bugs from that littered the city.*
Winter Soldier: *The Soldier settled himself onto the roof of the building across the street from Hawkeye’s apartment building, staking it out through his binoculars.*
Winter Soldier: *Hawkeye was doing an admirable job at keeping the Russian mafia from taking over his home, but it was only a matter of time before Kazi made his move.*
Winter Soldier: *He would either kill Hawkeye, or he wouldn’t. It didn’t matter to the Soldier either way, except that Hawkeye made the perfect bait.*
Winter Soldier: *Despite the cold, the tenants were apparently having a barbecue, passing around misty bottles of beer and plates heaped high with meat.*"
17,17099468,Hawkeye,Soldier,"Hawkeye: He would either kill Hawkeye, or he wouldn’t. It didn’t matter to the Soldier either way, except that Hawkeye made the perfect bait.
Soldier: *dropped his binoculars and leaned back on his left hand, preparing himself for a long night of boredom.*
Blond man: If I could rearrange the alphabet, I would put ‘u’ and ‘I’ together.
Soldier: *gaped up at the blond man, then yanked his gun out of his thigh holster and pointed it at his face.*
Blond man: Not that one, huh, *shuffling through his flashcards* On the scale of one to America, how free are you tomorrow night?
Soldier: *clicked off the safety.*
Blond man: Oh come on! Cut me some slack, I have no idea what I’m doing.
Soldier: I don’t even know your name.
Blond man: I’m Steve Rogers.
Soldier: *scrambled to his feet, chucked a bright red smoke bomb at Steve Rogers’ face, and then ran away.*
Steve: I don’t get it. What set him off?
Sam: Maybe it was your pick up line. ‘On a scale of one to America’—really, Steve?
Steve: I was sticking to a theme. What are you doing?
Sam: It’s the only knife you have that’s clean.
Steve: *watching him with a small frown* It was my name. As soon as he heard ‘Steve Rogers,’ he freaked out.
Sam: Didn’t you say he was HYDRA?
Steve: *shoulders slumped* Oh."
18,17099468,Sam,Steve Rogers,"Sam: The imperative word being ‘was’ here, *holding up both his hands*. Stop looking at me like that, I’m on your side. All I’m saying is that if he spent years being brainwashed by HYDRA, it stands to reason ‘Steve Rogers’ would freak him out, right? You did kill their supreme leader.
Steve: *shoulders slumped*. Oh.
Sam: *popped an apple slice in his mouth*. Why the Winter Soldier, anyway? You don’t see him as some sort of fix-it project, do you? Because I can’t begin to tell you how problematic that is on so many different levels, buddy.
Steve: No! God, no. It’s just—and, for God’s sake, Steve looked dreamy—“have you seen the way he moves? He’s stunning. Inspiring. And those eyes. They’re like—Sam, I can’t describe them.
Sam: Murderous? Bloodthirsty?
Steve: *scowling*. Profound.
Sam: Are we talking about a man or the Sundance Film Festival?
Steve: *twisted up his stained kitchen towel and snapped it at Sam*.
Sam: *caught it the second time Steve took a shot at him*. They engaged in a brief but violent tug of war that Steve of course won. *pointed warningly at him*.
Steve: *backed off, smug*.
Sam: *ate another apple slice*. Are you sure he’s even into you? It’s possible dude’s got no time for romance.
Steve: I thought he was, *staring forlornly down at his once-white towel*. He called me, once. And he bought me tacos. But—maybe you’re right. *snorted sadly*. You’re probably right. It wouldn’t be the first time Captain America ruined my chance at a relationship.
Sam: *observed*. You missed a spot.
Steve: *sighed, tossing the towel into the sink*. I’m going to take a shower.

The Soldier: *removed his scarf*. *touched the corners of his eyes, his lips, the tip of his nose, the bristle on his cheeks*. *looked at his eyes in the mirror*. *pulled his lips back into a smile*.

Tony: Sir. *sparks popped up around the workbench as Tony painstakingly welded a wire a microcontroller*. What’s up, FRIDAY?
FRIDAY: Captain Rogers requires your assistance."
19,17099468,Tony,FRIDAY,"Tony: What’s up, FRIDAY?
FRIDAY: Captain Rogers requires your assistance.
Tony: Are aliens invading? Again?
FRIDAY: I believe he needs what you humans call an ‘intervention’.
Tony: Say no more.
FRIDAY: Approximately five point three hours. However, when humans reach a certain age—
Tony: Finish that sentence, FRIDAY. I dare you.
Tony: Not that I’m unwilling to sacrifice my precious time to help the good Captain, but what’s the matter with him?
FRIDAY: The Winter Soldier disappeared approximately two point five weeks ago, sir. Which you knew. Because I told you.
Tony: Right right. Are we sure he’s not dead?
FRIDAY: Before he vanished, he left Ivan Banionis tied up on Hawkeye’s doorstep ‘like some sort of fucked up Christmas present.’ Hawkeye’s words, sir.
Steve: What’s the point of having locks of everyone just breaks in anyway?
Tony: What are you doing?
Steve: You know, a lot of people have been asking me that lately.
Tony: I think that says more about you than everyone else, buddy.
Tony: Tony! That is incredibly rude.
Tony: Steve. Are you writing a romance novel?
Steve: So"
20,17099468,Tony,Steve,"Tony: That is incredibly rude. *ignores him, skimming the last three paragraphs of Steve’s document, his eyebrows slowly inching their way up his forehead* Steve. Are you writing a romance novel?
Steve: *irritation knotted the corners of Steve’s mouth into a frown* He reclined back in his chair, folding his arms over his chest. Tony was briefly worried his shirt wouldn’t survive the movement. So what if I am?
Tony: Wait wait wait, let me repeat myself: Captain America is writing a romance novel? *his voice lifting in volume and poorly suppressed glee*
Steve: *Captain America failed to look anything but deeply unimpressed* Tony clicked his tongue. He’d at least been hoping for a blush. I needed something to do, and it turns out I’m good at writing.
Tony: *Tony’s eyes drifted back to the laptop. Loathe as he was to admit it, Steve had a point. Admittedly, his knowledge about what made a romance novel good was limited, but from the three paragraphs he’d read it did seem far superior than what was out on the current market.* Okay, sure, literally no one is surprised that Steve Rogers is good at something he put his mind to. The question is—why?
Steve: *Steve set his jaw stubbornly, fixing Tony with a look that somehow made him feel all of five years old* He could be as sanctimonious as he wanted—that didn’t change the fact that he was writing a romance novel in his spare time.
FRIDAY: He’s pining, sir.
Steve: *Steve hissed* Snitch.
FRIDAY: And writing poignant romance novels.
Steve: *Steve canted his head back to frown disapprovingly at the ceiling* You read it?
FRIDAY: I apologize, Captain Rogers, but I automatically have access to everything saved on the Stark Network, unless specified otherwise. For what it’s worth, it’s very well written, and I’m looking forward to see where you take it.
Steve: *Steve said to Tony, pointedly*
FRIDAY: *There was a delicate pause, and then FRIDAY added* But you haven’t left your kitchen in four days.
Tony: Oh look, I have a call. *He tapped some buttons on his phone, pretending to answer it. Then, without saying a single word, he ‘hung up’ and said.* That was Fury. A robot is attacking Central Park.
Steve: *Steve narrowed his eyes.*
Tony: Look, I’m serious. *Tony held his phone out to Steve, displaying a four-legged package delivery Stark prototype that was steadily headbutting a garbage can near a patch of snow.* Better go quick, Captain America. Might be a Nazi robot.
Steve: *Steve shot a forlorn glance at his romance novel (what the fuck), then saved his document and closed his laptop.* What about you?
Tony: *Tony waved a hand.* I’ll catch up.
Steve: *Eyeing him suspiciously, Steve grabbed his laptop, tucked it under his arm, and left the kitchen.* Don’t let him read it, FRIDAY! *Steve shouted from the other room.*
FRIDAY: Belay that order, Tony shouted back.
Tony: *He waited until the door swished shut after Steve before he whipped out his phone again and immediately tried to hack into his own network.* Come on, *he wheedled.* Let me see it, FRIDAY.
FRIDAY: No, FRIDAY said.
Tony: I designed you!
FRIDAY: Then you should have included a better backdoor into your security network, sir, *said FRIDAY, haughtily.*
Tony: *Letting out a disgusted noise, Tony tossed his phone onto the kitchen table.* At least tell me if there are racy bits, *he pleaded.*
FRIDAY: Captain Rogers is a talented writer. His novel is very moving.
Tony: Ugh. Sounds boring.
Pepper: *Pepper said, peeking her head into the kitchen.* FRIDAY said you were here.
Tony: *Tony hopped to his feet, grabbing her in a quick hug and smacking an affectionate kiss on her cheek.* I was called in to stage an intervention with the Captain.
Pepper: *Pepper frowned at him*"
21,17099468,Tony,Pepper,"Tony: Ugh. Sounds boring.
Pepper: Tony? Pepper said, peeking her head into the kitchen. FRIDAY said you were here.
Tony: Pep! Tony hopped to his feet, grabbing her in a quick hug and smacking an affectionate kiss on her cheek. I was called in to stage an intervention with the Captain.
Pepper: What did you do? Where is he?
Tony: I may or may not have released a ‘killer’ robot on New York.
Pepper: Tony!
Tony: Did you not hear the quotes? The quotes were there for a reason. It won’t actually hurt anyone. He paused. Except maybe Cap. Slightly. Just a little. Nothing permanently damaging. He’s writing poignant romance novels, Pep! I’m being a good friend.
Pepper: God preserve the people you consider friends, Pepper muttered, but the joke was on her: Pepper was his best friend.
Tony: Oh look, he’s found the robot, Tony said, holding up his phone. Pepper lifted her eyes toward the ceiling in exasperation, but she still circled the kitchen table to watch the video with him, so Tony figured she was just trying to make a point.
Steve: Tony, Pepper sighed. Why does the delivery bot shoot fireballs?
Tony: Theft protection, duh, Tony said. Also, it’s cool.
Bucky: Bucky Barnes was hiding.
Bucky: The Soldier had lived an entire life compartmentalizing the crimes he had been forced to commit while brainwashed by HYDRA. Bucky Barnes had been tucked away in one of those compartments, under lock and key, hidden deep, deep away. Now Bucky was coming to the surface in fits and starts. For example: when the Soldier was making himself mac and cheese out of a packet for dinner, he was struck with the abrupt and hilarious realization that Steve finally returned his feelings—while he was the Winter Soldier. Bucky laughed so hard he slid to the kitchen floor. Steve had given him falafels. And chocolate. Who gives the Winter Soldier chocolate? Steve Rogers, that’s who. He swiped the back of his hand over his eyes and blinked at the blurry kitchen light. Someone up there was having a long fucking laugh at Bucky’s expense.
Steve: No matter what the others thought, Steve wasn’t actually pining. He hadn’t known the Soldier well enough to put everything on hold just because the other man decided he wanted nothing to do with Steve.
Steve: Two months after the Winter Soldier’s abrupt disappearance, Natasha came to visit. Steve blinked up at her from where he was hanging upside down on the couch.
Natasha: Welcome back, he said, genuinely pleased to see her. How was Odessa?
Steve: Just fine, Steve said.
Natasha: Are you alright, Steve? Natasha asked. She’d done her hair today, big round curls bouncing over her shoulders.
Steve: Just fine, Steve said."
22,17099468,Steve,Natasha,"Steve: Welcome back, *genuinely pleased to see her*
Natasha: Are you alright, Steve? *big round curls bouncing over her shoulders*
Steve: Just fine.
Natasha: *sank to the floor in front of him, crossed her legs, and rested her wrists on her knees* You’re not still mooning over the Winter Soldier, are you?
Steve: Me? Moon? I don’t moon. *Which was the biggest lie of the century, since he’d spent years fifteen to twenty-five mooning over his best friend.*
Natasha: *picked at a thread on her jeans* You know, the very fact that you got as far as you did without getting shot is—surprising.
Steve: Reminding me of how successful I was doesn’t actually help, Nat. All things considered.
Natasha: I’m not really equipped for sympathy. Sometimes trying my best just makes people feel bad.
Steve: *reached out an arm to pat her knee affectionately* The fact that you care enough to even be here is what matters. *swung his legs off the back of his couch and rotated into a proper seated position* Honestly, Nat, I’m just bored. I have all this energy and no outlet. Tony’s been sending out robots to beat up inanimate objects to distract me, but since they don’t actually want to hurt me, it’s boring. I still go though, since he’s trying so hard.
Natasha: We-ell, *quirking a crooked smile at Steve* There’s that nurse I told you about, Kate. Why don’t you take her to dinner? See how things go?
Steve: Natasha—
Natasha: Steve, look. I know you aren’t over your one true love, the Winter Soldier— *leaned back on her hands, tipping up her chin to stare Steve in the eye* It’s time to move on.
Steve: *carved off a piece of his steak, then concentrated on cutting it into progressively smaller pieces* Sorry, I was woolgathering. What was that?
Kate: *rested her elbow on the table, propping her chin up and smiling dryly at him* You’re really not feeling this date, are you?
Steve: *grimaced* God, I’m sorry. It really has nothing to do with you—
Kate: *lifted her free hand and closing her eyes briefly* If you give me the ‘it’s not you, it’s me speech, I really will stab you with this fork. *considered it disparagingly* Although it would probably just bend.
Steve: Please don’t test it to find out.
Kate: *did not stab him, although she definitely thought about it* Let me guess: another woman?
Steve: No, *a little defensively*"
23,17099468,Kate,Steve,"Kate: it’s not you, it’s me speech, I really will stab you with this fork.” *She considered it disparagingly.* “Although it would probably just bend.”
Steve: Please don’t test it to find out.
Kate: Let me guess: another woman?
Steve: No.
Steve: Another man?
Steve: Am I that obvious?
Kate: *A quick flash of teeth against pink lips, and then Kate looked down at her plate.* “You really are,” she said.
Kate: Tell you what, *Kate said, picking up her fork and knife.* “Why don’t we call off the date, but finish dinner? This steak is fantastic—although honestly, I probably would have ordered the crab if I knew the night was going to turn out like this.”
Steve: You could have ordered the crab anyway, *said Steve, earnestly.*
Kate: *Kate snorted, then laughed and shook her head.* “Your man’s an idiot if he doesn’t see what he’s got,” she said, smiling at him.
Steve: *Steve smiled back at her, touched.* He picked up his fork. Maybe he was being over-hasty; who knows, maybe after a couple of dates—
Steve: Ow! *Steve yelped, utensils clattering to his plate.* He lifted his arm and peered under it. There was a dart sticking out of his tricep. It had a little note tied to it.
Kate: Oh my god, are you alright? *Kate asked, horrified.*
Steve: Yeah, sure, *Steve said, distractedly,* although for all he knew, the dart was poisoned. He’d just have to cross that bridge if he came to it. He plucked the dart out of his tricep and unrolled the small piece of paper.
Steve: WHAT THE FUCK DO YOU THINK YOU’RE DOING
Steve: *A little bubble of hope swelled in the middle of Steve’s chest.* He twisted around to look out the window, and—there, a glint of metal. Steve shot to his feet so quickly his chair tipped over, crashing to the floor. Several other people also stood, alerted by the commotion. Ignoring them, Steve rushed to the window. There was a small hole in the glass where the dart had punched through. Steve touched it with the tips of his fingers, then focused outside. Across the street stood the Winter Soldier, hands in his pockets, mask covering half his face. Steve’s fingers curled into the palm of his hand, breath fogging across the glass.
Steve: *The Soldier pointed at Steve, as if to ask, Again, what the fuck do you think you are doing?*
Steve: *Steve threw up both his hands:* You disappeared!
Steve: *The Soldier settled his hand on his hip, clearly not buying any of Steve’s (reasonable) excuses.*
Steve: We’re just friends! *Steve shouted at the glass,* causing the patrons at a nearby table to jolt in surprise. Several phones were up and pointed at him, which meant this whole scene would be viral on YouTube in, oh, five minutes. The Soldier pinched the bridge of his nose, a gesture that was becoming familiar, then glanced over his shoulder. A woman had poked her head out of a nearby bodega to shout at him. He waved her off, shot one more glare at Steve, then shoved his hands back into his pockets and started down the street, head lifted, oddly jaunty.
Steve: Excuse me, *Steve said, pushing past the brave people crowding around him to watch this unfolding drama up close and personal.* He sprinted outside, but by the time he got to the other side of the street, the Soldier had already been swallowed up by the night. Steve made his way slowly back into the restaurant, where the atmosphere had"
24,17099468,Steve,Kate,"Steve: Excuse me, *pushing past the brave people crowding around him to watch this unfolding drama up close and personal*, I don't need a distraction anymore! Haven't you heard? The Soldier is back!
Kate: Good news?
Steve: Yeah, I think so. *A slow grin spread across his face.* I hope.
Kate: *Some unreadable emotion flashed across Kate’s face, but then the curl at the corner of her mouth spread into a genuine smile.* To hope, then.
Tony: FRIDAY, call off the robot.
Steve: *hesitantly swung the shield over his shoulder. The magnets engaged, fixing it to his back.* Thank you, Tony. Really. You’re a good friend."
25,17099468,Steve,Tony,"Steve: Thank you, Tony. Really. You're a good friend. *smiles at the robot and pats the top of its head*
Tony: *fidgets, glad that Steve couldn't see his face* Okay! Now that that's over with—
Dark Side: *lands lightly on his feet, knees bending on impact* The hell are you looking at? *snaps at the kid goggling at him from the top of a dumpster*
Kid: *stammers* S-sorry, sir. It's just—you have a metal arm and I think it's really really awesome.
Bucky: *glances down at his arm, then sighs* Is everything okay?
Kid: I mean, do you require assistance? I am a superhero.
Bucky: *sighs* No, really! I can help! I'm good at helping! I once stopped an arms dealer selling alien weapons all by myself!"
26,17099468,Bucky,Kid,"Bucky: I mean, do you require assistance? I am a superhero.
Bucky: No, really! I can help! I’m good at helping! I once stopped an arms dealer selling alien weapons all by myself! Ask Mr. Stark, he’ll tell you.
Bucky: I’m—I need to tell someone. Something.
Kid: I can help with that. Come on, you can practice on me! Tell me whatever it is you need to tell whoever.
Bucky: Go away.
Kid: Aw come on. There’s gotta be something I can help you with.
Kid: Because you obviously need help.
Bucky: How do you—what do you do if you—like someone. Romantically.
Kid: What, seriously?
Bucky: Him.
Kid: Him.
Bucky: Flowers are not practical.
Kid: Get him a sweater then.
Bucky: Huh. I can’t believe I’m taking advice from a kid in red and blue pajamas.
Kid: Excuse you, this is my super suit."
27,17099468,Clint,Winter Soldier,"Clint: Did you kill the pizza delivery boy?
Winter Soldier: Here. *hands Clint the pizzas*
Clint: Just the man we were waiting for— *opens the door*
Winter Soldier: *steps into Clint's apartment*
Steve: Soldier! *leaps to his feet*
Winter Soldier: I need to talk to you. *holds a crumpled package*
Steve: Of course. *steps forward*
Clint: Steve, maybe you should take this outside.
Natasha: Right, of course.
Steve: Wait. *chases after Winter Soldier*
Clint: Bomb?"
28,17099468,Steve,Clint,"Steve: Wait, *shouted* It's urgent!
Clint: He got you socks?
Steve: That's so fucking cute.
Natasha: Pizza?
Spider-Man: So?
Bucky: I chickened out.
Spider-Man: Of what? Giving him the socks?
Bucky: I mean, sort of. I threw them at him.
Spider-Man: Oh buddy, you're kind of a mess, aren't you?
Bucky: Shut up.
Spider-Man: Well, what did you used to do?
Bucky: Mostly, I smiled.
Spider-Man: I could see how that would be a problem, now.
Bucky: No! I mean—what I mean is, you know, your mask."
29,17099468,Spider-Man,Captain America,"Spider-Man: Look, what’s the big deal? It’s not like Captain America would say no if you just asked him out. Everybody knows he’s got, like, the biggest crush on you ever.
Bucky: It’s not that simple.
Spider-Man: Uh, yeah, it totally is.
Bucky: Alright, alright, your epic love story is the romance of the century, whatever.
Spider-Man: Okay, fine. If you can’t just walk up to him and tell him, ‘hey, man, I love you,’ then go big.
Bucky: What do you mean?
Spider-Man: You know! Like in the movies! Do something grand. A big, grand gesture to show Cap how much you really love him.
Bucky: Hey, want to help me with something?

Steve: —and I’m wearing them right now!
Sam: Steve—
Steve: They’re really comfortable. I mean, I don’t really understand why he’d get me socks, but—
Sam: There are few things—on this planet—that I care less about—
Steve: Oh, sorry. Need me to slow down? You look like you’re hurtin’ pretty bad.
Sam: Oh someone—will be hurtin’—
Winter Soldier: *steps directly into their path, hands on his hips*
Sam: Man, do not do that."
30,17099468,Sam,Steve,"Sam: I want to talk to you. *Sam tripped over his own feet, let out a strangled, “—hhgack!” and would have fallen on his face if Steve hadn’t grabbed the back of his shirt and hauled him back up.* Man, do not do that.
Winter Soldier: *ignores Sam and stares into Steve's face with hard eyes that glittered with determination.*
Steve: Soldier, *lifts the bottom of his shirt to wipe away the sweat from his forehead.* I will go on a date with you.
Steve: You will? I mean, that’s wonderful! We can do dinner—or maybe not, since— *Steve waved helplessly at his own face. Then he dropped his hand and sighed like he was giving up on himself.* When?
Winter Soldier: Now, *the Soldier said, then pivoted on his heel and began to walk imperiously away.*
Sam: What are you waiting for? *he asked, because he was a damn good friend.*
Steve: *beams at Sam, then jogs after the Soldier.*

Winter Soldier: Take off your shoes. Socks, too.
Steve: *toes off his shoes* What is this place?
Winter Soldier: It’s a jiu-jitsu training studio. *The Soldier shrugged off his jacket and taking it to a wall of cubbies. He unraveled his scarf, revealing his mask underneath.* Here. *He tossed two handwraps to Steve.*
Steve: How do you have access to this place?
Winter Soldier: I helped the owner out, once."
31,17099468,The Soldier,Steve,"The Soldier: Here. *tossed two handwraps to Steve*
Steve: How do you have access to this place?
The Soldier: I helped the owner out, once.
Steve: What—
The Soldier: *punches Steve in the sternum*
Steve: I am not a good person.
Steve: Good is relative.
The Soldier: *sits up and lifts Steve over his head*
The Soldier: *pins Steve down*
The Soldier: Point.
Steve: Holy shit.
The Soldier: I am not a good person.
Steve: The funny thing about tools is they need to be wielded by someone else.
Steve: Point.
The Soldier: *kicks Steve off and gets to his feet*
The Soldier: I still did it. I killed men, women, children. Family pets. All without a shred of guilt.
The Soldier: *feints at Steve and tackles him*
Steve: *traps the Soldier's metal arm against the floor*
Steve: I worked for HYDRA, you know."
32,17099468,Steve,Soldier,"Steve: I worked for HYDRA, you know. For years. I wasn’t brainwashed or tortured—I just didn’t know. It’s not the same, obviously, but if I blamed you for actions completely out of your control—well, that would be mighty hypocritical of me, wouldn’t it?
Soldier: *whacks Steve on the forehead with the heel of his free hand*
Soldier: I could have broken the brainwashing earlier. I think I did, a couple of times. I could have—
Steve: You did. You broke decades of conditioning. And then you spent the past five years actively destroying HYDRA bases. I think that’s a pretty good indicator of who you are.
Steve: Knowing everything I’ve done—you’re telling me you could still care for me?
Steve: Yes, easily. I already do.
Soldier: *breaks eye contact, inhales a shuddery breath, and gets to his feet*
Soldier: Let’s go.
Steve: Sooo.
Soldier: *slides a look at Steve out of the corner of his eye*
Steve: Right, yeah. It’s just that—I don’t want you to feel pressured into anything, and you know, we can go at your pace, or—
Soldier: Steve.

Steve: *snorts* Rude.
Steve: Hey."
33,17099468,Steve,Bucky,"Steve: Hey, *frowned, taking his phone from his back pocket* FRIDAY?
Soldier: *stood in front of the large bay window overlooking the city, watching Steve with fathomless eyes* Soldier? Steve whispered, awed. What is all of this?
Soldier: Someone told me that you should do a grand gesture if you want to—if— *hesitated for a long moment, then lifted his hands to his face. The Soldier took off his mask.*
Bucky: *set the mask on the coffee table. His hand trembled slightly, so he closed it into a fist, and brought it back to his side.* Hi, Stevie, Bucky said.
Steve: *jolted like he’d been electrocuted* Bucky?
Bucky: *cleared his throat, swallowed thickly, and spoke* For the longest time, I’ve spent my life just existing. If I felt anything at all, it was rage, or a need for revenge. But mostly I just operated like every day was a mission. And then you appeared, with your falafels and chocolate, and it was like—it was like coming back to life. *His lips quirked into a shaky smile* If nothing else—thank you. For that.
Bucky: *hoarsely, meeting Steve’s eyes* And. I wanted to tell you that—I know—I know I’m not the man you were probably expecting, but—I love you. So much, and for so long. *Bucky said hoarsely, meeting Steve’s eyes* And I think we can—I think we can be happy together.
Steve: *staggered forward, wrapping one hand around Bucky’s wrist* Bucky? Steve repeated, like the name was wrenched out of him."

Bucky: Hey, punk. *both went down to the floor*

Spider-Man: *tiptoed across the ceiling on his hands and feet* Oh my god, oh my god, Mr. Stark had neglected to mention that he would be playing matchmaker for Steve Rogers and Bucky Barnes.

Steve: *wrapped tightly around Bucky's metal wrist* Huh.
Bucky: Didn't think about the clean up.
Steve: *laughed, then swung himself over, draping half his body on top of Bucky* Leave them.
Bucky: Kind of a fire hazard, too—
Steve: Leave them.

Steve: Earlier, it sounded like you thought I'd be disappointed to find out who you were.
Bucky: Well, not disappointed, but—I mean—
Steve: I knew your eyes. *pushed himself up to stare earnestly down at Bucky* I love you, Bucky Barnes. Always have, always will.

Bucky: *listened to the quiet patter of rain against the window* Buck?
Steve: You're such a punk. *leaned up on his elbows and kissed him*"
