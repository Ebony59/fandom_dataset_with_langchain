0,17126087,Jefferson Davis,Miles,"Jefferson Davis: I don’t like the company you’ve been keeping.
Rio: You should invite your friends over more often, Miles!
Jefferson Davis: I know what you’re gonna do with that; it’s not art, it’s vandalism.
Rio: Ah, Mijo, what beautiful stickers.
Jefferson Davis: You better make sure to keep that up next year.
Jefferson Davis: I'd have to be blind not to feel Miles drifting away, shying from the sky high expectations and strict rules Jefferson has set up to keep his son safe.
Jefferson Davis: No matter the intentions, though, fear had settled in snug and heavy, making a home in his heart and keeping him tossing at night.
Jefferson Davis: Jefferson feels like a rope in tug-of-war-- pushing his son, trying to pull him closer, then pushing him again even harder. So frayed from the constant game that he's about to snap."
1,17126087,Jefferson,Miles,"Jefferson: I love you, son.
Miles: Yeah, I know, Dad.
Jefferson: You gotta say it back.
Miles: Y-you're really gonna make me say it--
Jefferson: I wanna hear it!
Miles: No, for real? Right in front of everybody--
Miles: I. Love. You. Dad.
Jefferson: That's a copy."
2,17126087,Jefferson,Miles,"Jefferson: Police, put your hands up— *pauses as the 'intruder' rises quickly, revealing himself to be Miles, a tight expression on his face and hunched in upon himself* Miles?
Jefferson: Woah, woah, easy, it’s okay, *says softly, hugging his son back* It's been awhile since Miles has embraced him like this, like the world was falling to pieces around him and his father was the only one who could make it better. Jefferson wished he was in a position to appreciate it, but worry was quickly overpowering everything else.
Rio: “¿Qué pasa, Miles? Was it the earthquake?”
Miles: *pulls away from the hug, breathing a little too fast* His eyes shone with unshed tears, and he looked up at his dad with a meek, watery expression, like he was six years old again with scraped knees and a heavy heart. “Do you really hate Spider-Man, Dad?”
Jefferson: *feels his eyes widen, his cheeks puffing as he exhaled slowly* Miles had never particularly cared about Spider-Man before, and Jefferson absently wondered what had brought this on. Of all the things he expected Miles to say, this was certainly out of left field. “Well, yeah…”
Rio: *gives her husband a soft smack on the arm*
Jefferson: *half-whispers* “What am I supposed to say?” He was usually the type to tell it like it was, and Spider-Man was a headache. He was the headache.
Miles: *clearly distressed* “Can I sleep here tonight?”
Jefferson: *replies* “Miles, it’s a weeknight. And you made a commitment to that school--”
Rio: *interrupts him with a poorly-executed stage whisper* “He’s clearly upset.”
Jefferson: *amends his answer, forcing his words softer* “All right, you can stay here.”
Miles: *nods, entire body growing slack* He waded to his bed as if gravity was pulling him down, turning on his side and pulling the covers over him without changing out of his clothes."
3,17126087,Rio,Jefferson,"Rio: He’s clearly upset.
Jefferson: All right, you can stay here.
Miles: *nodded, entire body growing slack. He waded to his bed as if gravity was pulling him down, turning on his side and pulling the covers over him without changing out of his clothes.*
TV newscaster: Spider-Man was dead.
Jefferson: His opinions on masked vigilantes was a constant block, he was never as close to Spider-Man as the city seemed to be.
Jefferson: It was a shame. Only twenty-six years old, leaving behind a wife and an aunt.
Officer Davis: Altercation in Forest Park involving… multiple… spider-people?
Jefferson: I’m on my way now.
Jefferson: *switching on his sirens and taking a sharp right towards Forest Park.*
Jefferson: *almost at the address when something swings into view; a rapidly moving blob of color and fabric hanging by a thread.*
Jefferson: It takes him a while to find the alleged spider-person, whose jerky, graceless movements were difficult to follow from the streets.
Jefferson: *He exits the car, slowly moving towards the alleyway with one hand on his hollister.*
Jefferson: *realizes with a start that the spider-man is crouched in front of a body, lying prone on the hard concrete.*
Officer Davis: Put your hands up!
Jefferson: *pulling out his service weapon and swiftly pointing it at the imitation spider-man*
Jefferson: *yells, “Put your hands up!”*
Jefferson: *The spider-man's hands rise up, and he slowly stands.*
Jefferson: *Officer Davis doesn't allow himself to linger on that for longer than a moment before turning his attention to the only evidence that the spider-man had been there at all.*
Jefferson: *The realization hits him like a train, a punch in the gut. It’s his brother, Aaron, who lies prone.*
Jefferson: *He doesn’t find what he’s looking for.*
Jefferson: He calls for the arrest of the new Spider-Man, and furrows his brow and punches the wall and makes no move to slow his..."
4,17126087,Jefferson,Spider-Man,"Jefferson: Get up, Spider-Man.
Jefferson: Come on, Spider-Man, get up.
Jefferson: Get up, Spider-Man!
Spider-Man: *bug-eyes blink sluggishly open, white lenses peering crookedly towards Jefferson from their spot on the ground.*
Spider-Man: *begins to move, twitching and fighting just to get to his knees.*
Jefferson: *relief pumps through his veins*
Jefferson: Spider-Man gets up. And he wins.

Jefferson: Hello, Miles? H--
Miles: Hey, Dad.
Jefferson: Are you alright?
Miles: I’m fine.
Jefferson: No, I can talk.

Spider-Man: Officer!
Jefferson: Thank you for your bravery.
Spider-Man: It was, uh, no problem.
Jefferson: Now, I don’t agree with your methods, but I-- oof!
Spider-Man: *clinging to Jefferson tight, cheek pressed against his chest like a child hugging a teddy-bear.*"
5,17126087,Jefferson,Spider-Man,"Jefferson: It was, uh, no problem. Now, I don’t agree with your methods, but I-- oof!
Spider-Man: *clinging to Jefferson tight, cheek pressed against his chest like a child hugging a teddy-bear*
Spider-Man: I look for-ward t’working wit’ you.
Spider-Man: *moves away, saluting Jefferson with two fingers* I love you!
Jefferson: Wait, what?
Spider-Man: And uh, look behind you!
Jefferson: *looks behind him*

Jefferson: The new Spider-Man was strange. There were a lot of little things that were strange. The way he just popped in from nowhere, how he talked, how he… hugged Jefferson and said he loved him? How does that fit in with normal human behavior, really?
Jefferson: Jefferson used words like ‘small’ to describe this Spider-Man in the past, but assumed it was only compared to his surroundings. He looked small in the alleyway, because he was crouched and hunched over. He looked downright diminutive fighting Fisk, because Fisk is more refrigerator than man and anyone would look tiny next to him.
Jefferson: But when they were talking, Spidey’s owlish eyes blinked up at him, head tilting back just to make eye contact. When he hugged him, he didn’t even make it to Jefferson’s shoulders. No, this Spider-Man really was a tiny thing, and that wasn’t all.
Jefferson: The weird voice he put on. Spider-Man wasn’t chewing three gumballs at once, he was trying to make his voice sound deeper.
Jefferson: He hugged Jefferson and said he loved him. Jefferson, who encouraged him when he was struggling and in pain and probably scared, because--Because Spider-Man was a child. An honest-to-God, young child.
Jefferson: Jefferson feels like he’s having a minor heart-attack when he thinks about how he took on Fisk by himself, how he very nearly lost. Did Spider-Man’s parents know he was here? Jefferson feels sick when he thinks about how worried he would be if his son was out fighting supervillains all alone-- and on a school night, too!
Jefferson: The last Spider-Man died. He was a super-powered, fully grown man with ten years of experience under his belt, and he still died doing the same type of thing this Spider-Man was doing now.
Jefferson: Jefferson finds his mind racing with plans. First, he was going to give his thankfully-normal-son a hug as soon as possible. Second? He was going to help Spider-Man stay safe, whatever that meant.
Jefferson: And so, Operation: Stop Spider-Man is a go."
6,17126087,Jefferson,Officer Davis,"Jefferson: Hey, Officer!
Officer Davis: Good to see you, Spider-Man!
Spider-Man: Hey! Good to see you too! Uh. Think you could help me out a second, man? I’m kinda new at this, so I’m not sure about, like, procedure or anything…
Jefferson: What do you need help with?
Spider-Man: Okay, so like, I know Peter used to leave the bad guys for you guys like this, but I don’t know if like, he called the police or let someone else do it or... I didn’t really just wanna leave him here, ‘cause what if no one finds him? He’d just be stuck here, right? So I was wondering if you guys had like, a procedure or a system with Peter that I should start following--
Jefferson: The procedure is to call nine-one-one and leave it to the police.
Spider-Man: But if I did that, then this guy would have-- oh, hold on. He was gonna mug someone with this, they would have been blasted into next week if I just-- Oh! I should have told the victim to call the police! And I forgot to leave one of these."
7,17126087,Jefferson,Spider-Man,"Jefferson: Hey, hold on son, you can’t just go around webbing up folks all willy-nilly.
Spidey: Yeah, I know! I didn’t! He was gonna use this on someone!
Jefferson: Put that down! You don’t know what’ll set that thing off!
Spidey: Don’t worry! It’s super busted, so I’m just gonna take it and--
Jefferson: You are not taking that thing!
Spidey: It is my job. I’m Spider-Man!
Jefferson: You could do something else. Like focus on school.
Spidey: I got straight A’s.
Jefferson: Then you could use your powers for something else, right? Like, I don’t know, dance?
Spidey: ...Dance.
Spider-Man: Look, I can’t just stop being Spider-Man. It’s like Peter Parker always said: with great power comes great responsibility.
Jefferson: The performance arts are very responsible! And very legal!
Spider-Man: Okay, so I’m just gonna take this thing--
Officer Davis: You aren’t leaving here with that thing.
Spider-Man: Well, you got me. Guess I-- *Spider-Man cut himself off, pointing frantically* Look behind you!
Jefferson: *Jefferson does not, in fact, look behind himself. Instead, he looks down at Spider-Man, putting on his best unimpressed-dad-glare learned from thirteen years of experience with--*
Spider-Man: *Spider-Man straight up disappeared. Right in front of Officer Davis, taking the weapon with him and frolicking off to throw himself into who knows what kind of trouble.*
Jefferson: I don’t know what I’m going to do with him!
Officer Davis: Mmhm.
Jefferson: How am I supposed to help him if he can teleport or disappear whenever he wants?
Officer Davis: Are you sure you saw that right, Mi Amor?"
8,17126087,Jefferson,Rio,"Jefferson: “I don’t know what I’m going to do with him!”
Rio: “Mmhm.”
Jefferson: “How am I supposed to help him if he can teleport or disappear whenever he wants?”
Rio: “Are you sure you saw that right, Mi Amor?”
Jefferson: “Come on Dad, everyone knows Spider-Man can’t teleport,”
Miles: “Se volvió un ocho hoy. Don’t worry about it, Miles,”
Rio: “Everyone knows, do they? How do you figure that?”
Miles: “‘Cause all his powers got put in here.”
Jefferson: “Where’d you get that?”
Miles: “My roommate gave it to me.”
Jefferson: “Yeah. And you know those comics are about Peter Parker, right? I’m talking about the new kid.”
Miles: “Spider-Man’s still Spider-Man.”
Jefferson: *humming, turning back to the television*
Jefferson: “You gotta say it back.”
Miles: “I said ‘I love you’. You gotta say it back.”
Jefferson: “Love you, son.”
Miles: *expression drops a fraction*
Miles: “Goodnight, Dad. Y buenas noches, Mami.
Jefferson: “Don’t forget about tomorrow!”
Miles: “Wouldn’t dream of it!”"
9,17126087,Jefferson,Miles,"Jefferson: You think I don't know how to find these spots? You're dad's still hip.
Miles: *mumbles* You're so old, man.
Jefferson: Hey, Dad, could you help me out a second?
Miles: Sure. What do you-- woah!
Jefferson: You know, your uncle and I used to do this kinda thing.
Miles: I know, Dad.
Jefferson: Except I was the one standing on his shoulders.
Miles: *no commentary*
Jefferson: I used to be half his height, can you believe that? Never imagined I'd grow to be twice his size.
Miles: *hops off his shoulders*"
10,17126087,Jefferson,Miles,"Jefferson: I used to be half his height, can you believe that? Never imagined I’d grow to be twice his size. *Miles hops off his shoulders*
Miles: I got my essay back. Got a ninety-six percent on it.
Jefferson: Nice. I knew you’d show those teachers what’s up.
Miles: And I didn’t get any write-ups last week.
Jefferson: Whoa, back up. Don’t want you breathing that stuff in.
Miles: Sorry.
Jefferson: Yeah-- just, be careful.
Jefferson: I’m proud of you, Miles.
Rio: Te quiero mucho, Miles.
Miles: Te quiero tambien, Mami.
Jefferson: Bye, work hard, love you!
Miles: Love you, Dad!
Jefferson: You got this, Spider-Man!
Spider-Man: *head turns, and when he catches sight of Officer Davis, the lenses of his mask crinkle upward.*
Spider-Man: Thanks for the help again, Officer."
11,17126087,Officer Davis,Spider-Man,"Officer Davis: Thanks for the help again, Officer, *bounces on top of Jefferson's squad car* with a quick salute before swinging off.
Officer Davis: His job is made easier, so he makes sure to thank Spider-Man on his way out. *Spidey practically glows at the praise.*
Officer Davis: When Jefferson gets there, Spidey seems to have the whole thing in the bag already, so he just cheers him on from the side. *A few other officers get in on it, and the next thing he knows, Spider-Man has a mini audience. He seems to enjoy the attention.*
Officer Davis: When Spider-Man swings by, rustling the umbrella of his table, Jefferson offers a wave. *They don’t talk about much more than the weather, but it’s nice anyway.*
Officer Davis: *Spider-Man swings by and he and Jefferson exchange a high speed high-five that has his hand stinging for hours.*
Officer Davis: *Jefferson nearly has a panic attack when Spidey’s knocked off the roof, but instead of a hard landing, he manages to stick to the trunk of a nearby tree.* Hey, man, Spidey says, a couple of small branches stuck to his costume. I lost my webshooters down here somewhere, could you--
Officer Davis: *Jefferson nods and begins his search a little further out from the tree, looking in the grass for anything that could be a webshooter.* Sure thing, Spider-Man. Just be more careful, please?"
12,17126087,Jefferson,Spider-Man,"Jefferson: Sure thing, Spider-Man. Just be more careful, please? *searches in the grass for anything that could be a webshooter*
Spidey: Yeah, fine, just kinda stressed out and not very relaxed, so--
Jefferson: You doin' alright there, Spidey?
Spider-Man: Thanks! You really saved my butt back there. *shakes Officer Davis' hand*
Jefferson: Why is your hand covered in bark?
Spider-Man: Hm? Oh. *begins to work on peeling tree bark from his glove*
Jefferson: Wait. Pull back. Where are you hurt?
Spider-Man: It's not bad, really, he just grazed me.
Jefferson: Seriously, it looks worse than it is. Probably.
Spider-Man: No doctors!
Jefferson: Do you want that getting infected?
Jefferson: Fine, we don't have to go to a doctor! But you can't just leave it alone, either."
13,17126087,Jefferson,Spider-Man,"Jefferson: No doctors! *voice rising*
Jefferson: Fine, we don't have to go to a doctor! But you can't just leave it alone, either. *spots another blot of red on the pavement, and follows it nearer the clump of police cars in the street*
Jefferson: My wife’s a nurse. Let her look at it, please? *moves until he's standing a few feet away*
Jefferson: She won't ask questions, you won't have to pay anything. And I won't be up all night wondering if you're alright out here.
Spider-Man: I guess... I guess that's a good idea. *grips his injured arm with one hand*
Rio: Uh, hello. Ma’am, *puts on his ‘grown up’ voice*
Rio: Sorry, it’s just, *leads Spidey inside, motioning for him to sit at one of the kitchen chairs*
Jefferson: Where do you usually go when you get hurt like this? *takes a seat in one of the chairs*
Spider-Man: Usually I just sleep it off and I’m fine.
Jefferson: What.
Rio: Well, normally this would have needed stitches. But I can see it’s already starting to heal over, *works on the wound*
Jefferson: Ah, but next time something like this happens, you know where to find us.
Rio: Yes, you’re welcome here anytime. Oh! *motions Jefferson to the desk*
Spider-Man: Thanks. You’re-- that’s really nice.
Spider-Man: Be careful out there! *turns with a wave* Love you, Dad!"
14,17126087,Jefferson,Rio,"Jefferson: Be careful out there!
Rio: I will, *waves*
Spider-Man: *turning with a wave* Love you, Dad!
Jefferson: He called me Dad, *says later, as Rio rubs his shoulders*
Rio: Should I call up Miles and tell him he has a new brother?
Jefferson: This is serious! What if he gets hurt out there--
Rio: Jeff--
Jefferson: *lets his head fall in his hands* I feel responsible enough for him as it is!
Rio: Jeff! *peers out at her husband*
Jefferson: I know you'll do right by that boy. Just have patience.
Jefferson: Hey, Miles.
Miles: Oh. Uh, hey. Dad.
Jefferson: I'm guessing you wanna talk.
Miles: I know you probably got school stuff going on right now, so how about, when you're done, we meet at that one pizza place nearby-- Gir-Ghirardelli's?
Miles: Am I-- wait. I'm not like... in trouble? You're not mad?
Jefferson: No, no. You're not in trouble. It's just talk.
Jefferson: You know, I've realized something."
15,17126087,Jefferson,Miles,"Jefferson: I want you to be open with me, when I haven't been... exactly... open. With you.
Miles: *foregoes picking at his pizza to look up at his dad, eyes wide and shiny*
Jefferson: Your uncle and I had a falling out. I never told you why.
Miles: *face twisted in surprised confusion*
Jefferson: Your dad wasn't always a cop. Aaron and I-- we did things I wasn't proud of. And then I decided to quit, and he decided not to. I think it killed him.
Miles: *looks down, brows furrowed as he processed the words*
Miles: You came here to talk... about Uncle Aaron? Nothing... else?
Jefferson: Not unless there's something else you wanna talk about. I just wanted to let you know that, with all this going on, you can come to me. Or your mom, or anyone else.
Miles: *face closes off, though not unkindly, as he goes back to picking at his pepperoni*
Miles: Thanks, Dad. But I don't really want to talk.
Jefferson: It doesn't have to be with me, it can--
Miles: Can we talk about something else? Please.
Jefferson: *can't really think of another subject*
Miles: *comes home with scrapes on his chin*
Rio: Miles, what happened to your chin?
Miles: Estoy bien, Mami. It's no big deal.
Rio: *teasingly taps at the scrape and begins to chant*
Miles: Mami, ¡no soy un bebé!
Jefferson: *flops heavy on the couch, flicking the TV on and surfing until he found an interesting news channel*
Miles: So. Mom said you accidentally adopted Spider-Man. I thought you hated superheroes. Something change your mind?
Miles: *sitting up with his hands between his knees, smiling like this*"
16,17126087,Jefferson,Miles,"Jefferson: So. Mom said you accidentally adopted Spider-Man. I thought you hated superheroes. Something change your mind? *Jefferson huffs and rolls his eyes as Miles makes his way to the couch.*
Miles: *Miles is sitting up with his hands between his knees, smiling like this was the most interesting topic of the year.* Hey, hey! Don’t get any ideas, okay? The point is to get him to stop the vigilante thing before he hurts himself.
Miles: Well, what if you can’t stop him?
Jefferson: *Jefferson is home when his phone goes off. It’s a number he doesn’t recognize, with a local area code.* Hello?
Spider-Man: Hey, Officer. You need help? Are you hurt?
Jefferson: No! No. I just had a quick question. Or two. And please don’t think this is creepy or anything, but I looked you up on--
Spider-Man: You related to Aaron Davis?
Jefferson: My brother. What’s this about?
Spider-Man: I was wondering if you knew who Aaron Davis got his Prowler gear from. They’re probably responsible for all the armed crimes that’s been going down lately.
Jefferson: I haven’t properly talked to my brother in years. I didn’t even know he was the Prowler until he died.
Spider-Man: Please, if you even have an idea of where to start, I need--
Jefferson: No. You need to drop this whole case. The police will handle it.
Spider-Man: The longer it takes to catch the guy making these weapons, the more people get hurt!
Jefferson: That’s their job to worry about it!
Spider-Man: I can’t just do nothing!
Spider-Man: I’ve already tried doing nothing, I can’t let it happen again--
Jefferson: No-- no, no, don’t hang u--
Jefferson: *Jefferson is interrupted by a click. He has to sit back and scrub his hands down his face, looking at the ceiling through his fingertips.* What was he doing?"
17,17126087,Spider-Man,Rhino,"Jefferson: Excuse me, but how are you watching that?
First coworker: It’s this community that keeps track of Spider-Man sightings and posts about ‘em! Their Twitter handle is ‘@spideyhuntersofnyc’ if you wanna--
Jefferson: Yeah, on second thought, can I just--
Officer Davis: *watching the livestream* Spider-Man honestly isn't doing so hot, a couple shoulder touches seem to be failed attempts at stinging through the Rhino’s tough armor. There's only so much time before ‘dodging and flipping’ was no longer a viable strategy, especially since--Oh man, the Rhino is armed, which isn't his typical style. Judging by the wail of sirens in the background, the stray, erratic purple blasts of the Rhino-sized claw-gun might have already gotten someone hurt.
Jefferson: *feeling frayed as a rope in tug-of-war* Should he leave work, take his squad car to the scene? He wouldn’t have time to check with his supervisor, it wouldn’t exactly be within regulation, but what else could he do--
Female coworker: Ooooh, ouch, *watching the livestream* Like Spider-Man didn’t just get blasted out of sight, to a nearby rooftop while Rhino made a break for it and God this is what dying of a heart attack feels like--
Male officer: Did Spider-Man just…
Jefferson: *stands to move out of the breakroom*
Male officer: Did Spider-Man just lose."
18,17126087,Spider-Man,Jefferson,"Jefferson: Did Spider-Man just... lose? *stands to move out of the breakroom*
Male officer: Lose.
Jefferson: For the first time in his short run, Spider-Man lost. *scene of the Rhino brawl is a mess*
Jefferson: The longer these weapons were out in the open, the more this type of thing would keep happening, and it was only a matter of time before someone got killed. *feeling responsible*
Jefferson: Ah. There it was, like a light bulb in his head. *realizing something about Peter Parker's motto*
Jefferson: He would have to do some digging, both in his own past and in police and public records, but maybe he could help end this whole mess, sooner rather than later. *files a report of his findings*
Jefferson: I’m sorry, who is this? *calling Spider-Man's phone number*
Unknown voice: Asked you first, dude.
Jefferson: This is Officer Davis, *looking for Spider-Man*
Unknown voice: Oh. Uh. Spider-Man isn’t here right now. Can I take a message?
Jefferson: Do you know where he is? I got some info he asked for.
Unknown voice: Well, I guess I could text him and ask. Please hold!
Unknown voice: He says he’s on some apartments by Foam Party. Thinkin’ about stuff. You know where Foam Party--
Jefferson: Yes.
Unknown voice: Okay. Well. He’s to the left of Foam Party. And don’t tell him I sent you!
Jefferson: *goes looking for Spider-Man on a rooftop in Brooklyn*
Spider-Man: D-- Officer Davis? What are you doing here?
Jefferson: You alright? I saw what happened earlier.
Spider-Man: Oh. Yeah. Kinda sore. Needed a quick roof-nap, but I’m fine.
Spider-Man: I can’t believe I lost a man the size of- of a tank.
Jefferson: Could’ve been worse. I remember Parker losing the Sandman down a water line. Our whole street had sand in the tap water for days.
Spider-Man: What about the time he accidentally flung one of Goblin’s glue bombs at a crowd?
Jefferson: Don’t remind me. I spent three hours helping the EMTs cut people loose."
19,17126087,Spider-Man,Jefferson,"Spider-Man: Sandman down a water line. Our whole street had sand in the tap water for days. *Spider-Man let out a short huff.*
Jefferson: What about the time he accidentally flung one of Goblin’s glue bombs at a crowd? *Jefferson gave an exaggerated shudder.*
Spider-Man: Don’t remind me. I spent three hours helping the EMTs cut people loose. *Spidey burst out laughing.*
Jefferson: I had to shave the back of this super fluffy, hairy dog to unstick it from a stop sign. *Jefferson couldn’t help joining in the laughter, as Spidey pauses to hug himself and take a breath.*
Spider-Man: I’m imagining it looking like, I dunno, it walked into a cheap barber shop and asked for that ‘Mufasa’ look-- *Spidey cuts himself off, sobering as he taps the ground with his fingers. After a moment of deliberation, he turns to Jefferson.*
Spider-Man: I’ve been meaning to say this for a while. I guess I didn’t really know how. But… *Spider-man pulls his knees to his chest, looking smaller than Jefferson is prepared for.*
Spider-Man: I’m sorry about your brother.
Jefferson: What were you doing? With Aaron.
Spider-Man: I’m sorry, *Spider-Man says, cut off by a hiccup and a harsh sniff.* It was my fault.
Spider-Man: He died because he wouldn’t kill me. *Spider-Man scrubbed at his eye over the mask, pushing the lens up.* And he only found me in the first place because I wasn’t-- *another hiccup,* --wasn’t careful enough.
Jefferson: My brother made his own choices. I wonder sometimes-- if I didn’t cut him off, if maybe I could have helped him make better ones. *Jefferson slings one arm over Spidey’s shoulders, pulling him close and rubbing his arm.* Rhino, Kingpin, Aaron and me; you’re surrounded by adults making terrible decisions. That’ll never be your fault.
Spider-Man: I thought you’d be mad."

That’ll never be your fault.
Spidey: I thought you’d be mad. *Spidey straightens with another sniff.* Even just a little bit.
Jefferson: *Jefferson can't help but huff fondly.* I’m over being angry about this stuff. Let’s just focus who we can help, right now.
Spidey: *Spider-Man takes a moment to process the implication of the statement. His eye lenses crinkle up near the bottom when he finally seems to understand.* I thought you didn’t like superheroes?
Jefferson: *Jefferson stands, stretching and popping his back.* Yeah, well, changed my mind. I got a name you might like to know. I’ll give it to you, on two conditions.
Spidey: *Spider-Man stands as well, giving his eyes one last rub.* Yeah? What’s that?
Jefferson: One: If you’re going out to work on this case, you tell me where and when so I can get you help faster if you need it.
Spidey: *Spider-Man nods, clearly delighted at the prospect of a team-up.* Yeah, sure! I can do that!
Jefferson: Two: The minute it seems like it’s too much or too dangerous, you drop the case. Let it process normally.
Spidey: *Spidey seems less jazzed about that particular condition, but he nods anyway.* So what’s the name?
Jefferson: *Officer Davis let out a sigh and rubbed at his temple.* I know this might come as a surprise, but Aaron and I both used to be hired muscle. Some mob stuff, some gang stuff, some minor celebrity stuff, you get the idea.
Spidey: *Spider-Man nods, seemingly eating up every word.* Our weapons supplier was considered the best in the business. Folks called him ‘The Tinkerer.’
Jefferson: Yeah, well, I never knew his full name. Quit the business and forgot about him. But I decided to do some digging, and it turns out he was arrested a few years back; his sentence ended just a couple months ago.
Spidey: *Spider-Man punches one of his hands, lenses slanted with determination.* Sounds like a lead!
Jefferson: *Officer Davis puts in some overtime at work, so he asks Rio to meet up with him for dinner to make it a date night, and to fill her in on the newest developments in law and wall-crawling.* I just don’t know if I’m doing the right thing here.
Rio: This may be the best outcome you could hope for, Jeff. At least he isn’t doing this by himself.
Jefferson: Maybe.
Rio: *After dinner, the two link hands and wander on the sidewalk, glancing through the windows of quiet shops.* What? *she asks, looking at her husband. She jerks her head in response, prompting him to look across the street.*
Jefferson: *They’re in a more run-down part of Brooklyn, lined by shops without much infamy. The place is quiet and uncrowded for the city, making it easier to pick out what Rio is referring to. She’s motioning at a figure sitting on a bench across the street, sneakered feet crossed and reading a newspaper big enough to obscure their entire upper body.* Wait."
21,17126087,Jefferson,Spider-Man,"Jefferson: What are you doing?
Spider-Man: Stakeout. Found a source who says Phineas Mason walks here every day. Probably home or, hopefully, an evil lair.
Jefferson: *hands the picture of Phineas Mason to Rio*
Rio: *considers the picture and hands it back to Spider-Man*
Jefferson: I thought I told you to keep me updated on where you were for the case?
Spider-Man: Oh. I just figured, since I’m not actually doing anything major yet...
Jefferson: *gives Spider-Man his best unimpressed-dad look*
Rio: We’ll let you get back to your reading.
Jefferson: I’ll wait for you in my car.
Rio: Text me in an hour or I call the police.
Jefferson: Good call.
Jefferson: *wrenches the door of his patrol car open and grabs his duty belt*
Jefferson: *heading back to where he left Spider-Man sitting*
Jefferson: *finds the bench empty, newspaper stuffed haphazardly in a nearby trash can*
Jefferson: *curses softly under his breath*
Spider-Man: *clatters sunglasses at Jefferson's feet*
Spider-Man: Psst!
Spider-Man: Does this mean we’re teaming up?
Jefferson: *sighs and shakes his head*
Jefferson: *returns the fist-bump*
Spider-Man: Of course! Empty warehouse, perfect for supervillain things!"
22,17126087,Jefferson,Spider-Man,"Jefferson: Of course! Empty warehouse, perfect for supervillain things!
Spider-Man: Ok, I think that looks like a good way in, so, uh, hold on.
Jefferson: Hold on to w-- Agh!
Spider-Man: Look down there!
Jefferson: Okay, we got the guy. Now what?
Spider-Man: You sure?
Jefferson: Yeah. Tinkerer’s just a guy. And a nerd, if I remember right. I can take him, and even if I can’t? I got backup.
Spider-Man: Okay. Right. Sounds good.
Spider-Man: What--
Jefferson: PDNY, hands up!
Spider-Man: Hey! That was super easy! We make a pretty good team!
Jefferson: Yeah, I’d say.
Tinkerer: What? Spider-Man? I thought Rhino took you out!
Spider-Man: Takes more than one shot to take me out. Nice try, though."
23,17126087,Spider-Man,Tinkerer,"Spider-Man: Takes more than one shot to take me out. Nice try, though.
Tinkerer: Guess we'll just have to try again.
Spider-Man: We have to get out of here, we don't know who he was calling.
Jefferson: Good call. Right behind-- uh oh.
Spider-Man: You'll have to move faster than that!
Rhino: The little Spider-Man? Here? Can't wait for our rematch.
Spider-Man: You'll have to move faster than that!
Jefferson: You okay?
Spider-Man: Ow."
24,17126087,Jefferson,Spidey,"Jefferson: Oh, wow! Nice shot, keep going!
Spidey: We gotta bring him down! Like, all the way down!
Jefferson: Spider-Man? Can you hear me? Spidey?
Spidey: M’fine. I-- ouch-- just, give me a second.
Jefferson: You okay?
Spidey: I’m fine, I’m fine. Just, you know. Rocks.
Jefferson: You gave me a heart attack!
Jefferson: I love you, son."
25,17126087,Jefferson,Spider-Man,"Jefferson: I love you, son.
Spider-Man: *stiffens under his hold, pulling away*
Jefferson: *feels his vision warp and sway* Miles?
Spider-Man: *bug-eyes widen and stare up at him* Wait!
Jefferson: Miles! *stands, looking for any hint of his son in the shadow of the warehouse*
Jefferson: *interrupted by the buzz of his phone* Okay. See you there.
Rio: *asks* Why didn’t we know sooner?
Jefferson: *thinks* How could they not see their son in the mischievous, free-spirited wall crawler?
Jefferson: *thinks* maybe Jefferson didn’t find it as strange as he should have because, on some level, he knew his role as father.
Miles: Hey, Mom. Dad.
Rio: *asks* Is it bad?
Miles: No, I’m fine, I’m fine. Just tired.
Miles: Listen. I am… so sorry. I just-- after Uncle Aaron happened-- and I didn’t want to not be Spider-Man but I also didn’t want to lie but I didn’t know what would happen if I didn’t--!
Jefferson: Woah, woah, slow down."
26,17126087,Miles,Jefferson,"Miles: I want to talk to you, *talking too fast, breathing too heavily, and there's a sheen in his eyes that turns Jefferson's heart into a sad, pulpy mess.*
Jefferson: Woah, woah, slow down. This is a little... *His head bobs as he tries to search for the right words.*
Jefferson: This is a lot. *Jefferson has to take a seat.*
Rio: You literally called him 'Dad'. *She whispers, as Jefferson puts his head down.*
Jefferson: We're the worst parents ever. *He groans into the table.*
Miles: No! No, I mean? There are like a million kids I could've been! Why would you guess me?
Jefferson: The spray-painted suit? *Jefferson says, looking back up.*
Rio: Who says 'I love you' to someone they just met?
Jefferson: And... Aaron was close to that stuff. And you were close to Aaron.
Miles: I got bit. While I was with him.
Rio: I know, this is weird, and scary, and super un-normal.
Miles: But I made a promise. I won't stop being Spider-Man.
Jefferson: Stopping Spider-Man, supporting Miles, keeping his son safe, keeping his son happy... unrelated goals suddenly clash to become mutually exclusive.
Jefferson: There had to be something in the middle. A compromise between structure and freedom, safety and honesty.
Rio: I saw you on TV the other day. You saved three people from a house fire.
Jefferson: We're going to have to rewrite the whole family rulebook.
Miles: *Miles can't seem to stop his eyes from misting as he pulls both his parents into a hug.*"
