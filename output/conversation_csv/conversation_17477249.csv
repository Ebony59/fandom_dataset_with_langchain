0,17477249,Harry,Remus,"Harry: MOONY! *races undeterred down the sidewalk* MOONY!
Remus: *stands dumbstruck* *crouches down and throws his arms open* Harry!
Harry: Moony! Moony! It's Moony! *clings tightly around Remus' neck*
Remus: Harry. *croaks* Harry.
Harry: *leans back in Remus' arms* Moony.
Remus: *straightens up and begins walking*"
1,17477249,Remus,Petunia,"Remus: Mrs. Dursley please calm down, he says. I'm only a friend of Lily's.
Petunia: Your kind aren't welcome here. Give me Harry and leave here immediately before my husband returns home. He won't be as polite as I am.
Remus: If you don't mind, I think I'd like a look around where Harry is living now, he says calmly.
Petunia: Absolutely not!
Remus: Petunia, he begins as he takes a step closer to her. Lily was a great witch, I'm certain you knew that.
Petunia: *swallows before nodding once*
Remus: You're right. She was, he says.
Remus: Lily and I were neck and neck with each other for top marks at school. I suppose you could say we were at the top of, as you so eloquently put, our kind, so certainly you understand the magic I am capable of. The things I can do. Remus shoots her a smile that doesn't reach his eyes and pats Harry soothingly on the back before continuing.
Remus: If I were you, I would invite me in so I could see with my own two eyes what a fantastic life you are providing for my best friends' son in the wake of their untimely deaths.
Petunia: *fixes him a dirty look before begrudgingly unlocking the door* Hurry up then, she says. His door is the first on the right."
2,17477249,Remus,Petunia,"Remus: This one here? *asks*
Petunia: *nods*
Remus: Do you- lock -him in here? *asks*
Petunia: What else are we supposed to do? The idiot boy figured out how to get out of the crib months ago and crawled to our room wailing. How were we supposed to get any sleep? *says* How was our precious Dudley supposed to get any sleep!
Remus: You locked up Harry- *Petunia nods* In. A. Closet. *It's not a question* *Petunia nods a second time*
Remus: Goodbye then. I'd say it was nice meeting you, but then I'd be lying. *says*"
3,17477249,Remus Lupin,Harry Potter,"Remus: Heâ€™s barely 22 and nearly alone in the world, but Remus Lupin will be damned before he lets down Lily Potter again. *pulls the blanket up under Harryâ€™s chin and gives him a pat on the back.*
James: Moony will take good care of you, Harry, *smiles and waves at the two of them.*
Harry: *points to Remus and yells â€œMoony!â€�*
Dumbledore: *makes an unannounced visit to Remus and Harry's little cottage in Wales.*"
4,17477249,Remus Lupin,Dumbledore,"Remus Lupin: Mr. Lupin, I trust you are well.
Dumbledore: I, er, yes. Quite well. And you sir?
Remus Lupin: Right, okay, I'm just gonna...
Dumbledore: Oh please, continue. We can talk once breakfast is served. I trust you'll need your energy for this conversation.
Remus Lupin: Can I get you anything, professor?
Dumbledore: Just tea for me, thank you.
Remus Lupin: Well Remus I suppose I ought to cut right to the chase as they say.
Dumbledore: I'm here to ask you about Sirius Black."
5,17477249,Remus,Sirius Black,"Remus: I'm here to ask you about Sirius Black.
Dumbledore: I'm sorry, what?
Remus: Pardon me, my boy, pardon me. It was not my intention to give you a fright.
Dumbledore: Pardon me Mr. Lupin, but I must ask, have you acquired a baby?
Remus: Yes, I suppose you could say that sir.
Remus: I'm coming.
Harry: Moony!
Remus: I'm here, it's okay.
Harry: Moony.
Remus: Well Harry, I don't think..."
6,17477249,Remus,Harry,"Remus: Well Harry, I don't think we'll be able to keep this a secret for much longer. Let's go meet the headmaster.
Dumbledore: I suppose I cannot say I'm surprised.
Remus: Oh?
Dumbledore: And I'm afraid I now owe Minerva a great deal of money. Never place a bet with her, Mr. Lupin, you will not win.
Remus: I'll be sure to keep that in mind.
Dumbledore: Speaking of Minerva, she was actually the one who recommended I come here today.
Remus: *nods*"
7,17477249,Remus,Dumbledore,"Remus: Yes, he betrayed us all.
Dumbledore: Well then, I do suppose that answers my question, doesn't it? Thank you Mr. Lupin. Shall we move onto the other matter at hand then?
Remus: *nods weakly*
Dumbledore: If Harry is staying with you for the foreseeable future, I suppose you'll be needing some help with things here and there.
Harry: *looks up*
Remus: *looks up in shock*
Dumbledore: You are more than welcome to return to Hogwarts for the moons. I'm sure Minerva or Poppy will be more than happy to watch Harry for an evening or two while you are afflicted. And perhaps I can get you in touch with a few other wizarding families with boys his age. I prefer that we keep this little situation under-wraps for as long as possible but there are a couple of families from the Order whom I think we can trust. That is, of course, if you believe it to be a good idea.
Remus: You mean I can keep him?
Dumbledore: *gives him an amused look*
Remus: *shakes his head*
Dumbledore: Yes, I thought so. And as it happens, I have a feeling Petunia Dursley won't take the boy back even if we were to get on our hands and knees and beg.
Remus: *laughs internally*
Dumbledore: Well then, Mr. Lupin, I suppose I only have one more question. Do you believe yourself capable of raising Harry Potter?
Remus: Yes, I do.
Dumbledore: Very well then. I expect you'll be needing some funds if you are to be raising a child. I will have some of Harry's inheritance sent over once a month to help with the basics.
Remus: *opens his mouth to object*
Dumbledore: I was here when you opened your cupboards, Remus. And if they're any indication to how well you are faring financially, then you are going to need a bit of help now and then.
Remus: *nods*
Harry: Moony? *points finger*"
8,17477249,Remus,Dumbledore,"Remus: And if they're any indication to how well you are faring financially, then you are going to need a bit of help now and then.
Dumbledore: My apologies Harry, This is Professor Dumbledore. I promise you've met him though I'm sure you don't remember.
Harry: Moony?
Remus: He's come by for tea and to ask after you.
Dumbledore: You seem to know what you're doing.
Harry: Moony!
Dumbledore: What's that now, Harry?
Harry: Moony!
Remus: Please pardon the language Professor, but I believe he's just told you to 'piss off'."
9,17477249,Remus,Lily,"Remus: Lily! *yells*
Lily: *nearly clips the rat's tail with the heel of her shoe*
Remus: *shuts his eyes in an attempt to wake up*
Remus: *watches Padfoot mercilessly mangle Wormtail*
Remus: *looks to James and Lily with desperation*
James: *calls for Padfoot*
Remus: *watches James and Lily pet Padfoot's belly*
Lily: *shoots Remus a pointed look*
Remus: *tries to wake up*
Remus: *searches for his wand*
Remus: Expecto Patronum.
Remus: Find Albus Dumbledore and tell him Sirius Black would never betray his family.
Remus: *watches the wolf bound from the room*
Remus: *sits in an uncomfortable overstuffed chair*
Remus: *concentrates on imagining Sirius, James, and Peter*
Remus: *waits for Dumbledore to elaborate*"
10,17477249,Remus,Dumbledore,"Remus: Pardon me, sir. But would you mind telling me what's going on?
Dumbledore: Mr. Lupin, I was going to ask you the same. After our conversation yesterday, I was under the impression you believed Sirius Black quite capable of abandoning his friends and family to become a Death Eater.
Remus: I've had a change of heart.
McGonagall: What I believe Albus is trying to ask, is there anything you wish to tell us?
Remus: Professor McGonagall, he begins, shifting in his seat so that he's directly facing his former head-of-house."
11,17477249,Harry,Remus,"Harry: Moony, *sits nestled into the crook of Remus' elbow*
Remus: What's that, Harry?
Harry: Moony, *sinks further into the crook of Remus' elbow*
Remus: I guess the headmaster's office isn't all that exciting for Harry here. He's just told me he's quite bored.
McGonagall: Well we can't have that. Perhaps it's time..."
12,17477249,Remus,Harry,"Remus: I guess the headmaster's office isn't all that exciting for Harry here. He's just told me he's quite bored.
McGonagall: Well we can't have that. Perhaps it's time we take Mr. Potter to meet Poppy in the infirmary. It'll be Poppy who watches over Harry during the next moon.
Remus: The infirmary is eerily quiet. Perhaps, Mr. Lupin, it's quiet because there aren't three rowdy boys trying to knock down my door, disrupting the peace, to check on you. It's much quieter here without you in one of these beds.
Remus: Well, peace and quiet are rather overrated.
Madam Pomfrey: Though I suppose my peace and quiet might be interrupted again very soon. Who is this, then?
Remus: This is Harry Potter. And Harry, this is Madam Pomfrey. She took care of me when I was a little boy at Hogwarts and now she's going to help me take care of you sometimes.
Harry: *holds his arms out to Remus in the universal way children say 'pick me up now'*
Remus: I'm not going anywhere. But sometimes I fall ill and when grown-ups are ill, they need help taking care of things.
Harry: Moony?
Remus: Just for one night, I promise I'll be back then.
Harry: Moony!
Remus: *pats Harry's back* Yes, yes, I love you, too.
McGonagall: I hoped you would go for him.
Remus: *raises an eyebrow in response* I watched them all day, Vernon and Petunia Dursley, after Albus told me that's where Harry would be taken and oh they were just awful, awful people. Albus insisted it was the best for him and with no immediate alternative, I relented. I knew you'd go for him when you could."
13,17477249,McGonagall,Vernon Dursley,"McGonagall: I watched them all day, Vernon and Petunia Dursley, after Albus told me that's where Harry would be taken and oh they were just awful, awful people. Albus insisted it was the best for him and with no immediate alternative, I relented. I knew you'd go for him when you could.
Remus: *raises an eyebrow in response*
McGonagall: When the dust settled, I knew you would check in on him and if things were as I predicted, then you would leave with him too.
Remus: The morning I went to the Dursleys I woke from a nightmare- Lily Evans Potter screaming at me to make it right and fast. I fell out of bed and apparated to Surrey so haphazardly I'm lucky I didn't splinch myself and bleed out on their front yard. Only Petunia was home but it didn't take long to see what they thought of Harry, *pauses* I should have gone for him sooner. It shouldn't have taken Lily Potter haunting my dreams to check in on him. I think I was naively hoping that Petunia would have gotten past whatever childhood grudge she held against Lily so that Harry could grow up with family as he deserves.
McGonagall: Mr. Lupin, not even blood could make you closer family to the Potters. Don't forget that.
Remus: *blinking rapidly, eyes stinging* (no direct engagement)
Madam Pomfrey: Bill Weasley! This is the hospital wing, we do not yell, *walking toward the commotion with Harry in tow*
Remus: STOP! Keep Harry there.
McGonagall: Mr. Lupin! (no direct engagement)
Remus: Bill, why did you bring that rat to the hospital wing?
Bill: *holds on steadfast to the rat, violently squirming* (no direct engagement)"
14,17477249,Remus,Bill,"Remus: why did you bring that rat to the hospital wing? *the rat is violently squirming, it's tail whipping back and forth and beady eyes going in all directions but Bill holds on steadfast. Remus will have to commend the kid later on his iron grip.*
Bill: He was running through the Gryffindor common room when I found him. The girls were yelling about a rat so I chased him down and caught him! That's when I saw he's missing a toe. I thought maybe Madam Pomfrey could regrow it.
Remus: *the blood drains from Remus' face and his wand hand wavers for a moment or two before his wits come back about him and he holds himself steady once more. If he wasn't sure before, he is now.* Mr. Lupin, I demand you provide us with an explanation for your fascination with this... With this rat.
Remus: *without looking away from Bill and the rat* Speak and the devil shall appear, as the muggles say. I think we've just found our devil.
Bill: *swallows and looks between him, McGonagall, and the rat* I need you to listen to me very carefully Bill.
Remus: Okay.
Remus: On the count of three, you are going drop the rat onto the closest empty bed. Drop him and then stand back as fast as you can, understood?
Bill: Yes, sir.
Remus: Good- okay Bill, one- two- three.
Remus: *In one fluid moment, Remus casts the charm just as Bill drops the rat down onto the nearest hospital bed. There's a bright flash of light and then, sitting where a rat was moments before, is none other than Peter Pettigrew.*
Remus: *holds his wand stead in the whimpering face of Peter and within moments he's joined by Professor McGonagall and Madam Pomfrey doing the same. Beside him, poor Bill Weasley's gone white as a sheet.*
Professor McGonagall: Mr. Weasley! Find the headmaster and bring him here immediately.
Remus: *without lowering his wand, Remus gathers Harry from Madam Pomfrey and holds Harry tightly to him before finally speaking directly to Peter himself.* Forgive me Peter but I was under the impression that you were very much dead.
Minister: If I am to understand your story correctly, Mr. Lupin, you are suggesting the Wizengamot open a case of suspected Death Eater association on Peter Pettigrew and open the now completed case of the mass murderer Sirius Black?
Remus: Yes.
Minister: And we are meant to take the word of a registered werewolf as enough pretense to do so? I'm afraid that's hardly evidence.
Dumbledore: *interrupts* Pardon me, minister, but it does not take an exceptional memory to recall how such logic-less biases create great problems for society in divisive times. Many would call it rather unwise to perpetuate stereotypes in times of peace.
Minister: Just because Peter Pettigrew has been found..."
15,17477249,Dumbledore,Minister,"Dumbledore: Pardon me, minister, but it does not take an exceptional memory to recall how such logic-less biases create great problems for society in divisive times. Many would call it rather unwise to perpetuate stereotypes in times of peace.
Minister: Just because Peter Pettigrew has been found alive does not mean he was a member of You-Know-Who's army, nor does it mean that Sirius Black is any less of a mass murderer who broke the oath of a fidelius charm and sold the location of James and Lily Potter to You-Know-Who!
Dumbledore: Very well Minister. If that is what you choose to believe, then who are we to argue? But before we conclude this meeting, are you confident enough in your decision to allow a potential death eater to walk free?
Remus: Mr. Pettigrew, do you deny the charges against you?
Harry: Moony.
Remus: I agree, Harry. Tea and pudding are absolutely in order.
Remus: I agree, Harry. Tea and pudding are absolutely in order.
Remus: I agree, Harry. Tea and pudding are absolutely in order."
16,17477249,Remus,Peter,"Remus: To his embarrassment, it takes him two whole days before realizing that Molly and Arthur's oldest son is the very same boy who came running into the hospital wing with Wormtail in tow. Remus makes a mental note to personally thank the boy for inadvertently bringing a massive injustice to light the moment he returns for the summer holidays.
Remus: At night, Remus lays awake, cycling between listening to the gentle rise and fall of Harry's chest and going over every interaction he can remember having with Peter in the last three years.
Remus: When he can't find a reason for Peter's betrayal or a single sign pointing to it, he expands his research parameters back even further to fourth year.
Remus: But no matter how many nights he lies awake, he never once finds a reason for Peter to abandon them so suddenly and disturbingly.
Remus: Still, though, he can't help but feel that the three of them missed something crucial and the monster on trial now grew from this vital forgotten piece.
Remus: Peterâ€™s hand shakes slightly as he lifts the glass dosed with veritaserum to his lips. His foot taps quickly at the base of the chair and if Remus wasnâ€™t already sold on Peterâ€™s guilt in this whole mess, he is now.
Remus: The cracks in Peter's facade grow wider with each passing day and as each day comes to a close, it's easier and easier to read Peter like the open book he was as a boy.
Remus: With each question, Remus grips the railing in front of him tighter and tighter until his knuckles go white. He thinks he might be sick.
Remus: Remus sits on his hands to keep himself from jumping the partition and finishing what Sirius set out to do on Halloween night.
Remus: With the fault of the Potterâ€™s murders clearly on Peterâ€™s hands and no other death eater confessions putting Sirius in line with You-Know-Whoâ€™s followers, the ministry has no choice but to order the immediate release of Sirius Black.
Remus: Thatâ€™s how Remus finds himself on a dock in the middle of nowhere, charmed to keep muggles away, shivering despite the three jumpers he managed to layer underneath his coat.
Remus: Remus loses track of the time searching for any glimpse ofÂ a little wooden boat out in the foggy sea and he doesn't look away until his eyes begin to ache.
Remus: As the chill coming off the sea settles into his bones, he casts a warming charm but it does little to stop his shivering.
Remus: Remus is beginning to think he's found himself in some kind of unending purgatory when the fog finally begins to lift and a little dot appears on the horizon."
17,17477249,Sirius,Remus,"Sirius: Are you sure about this?
Remus: Absolutely positive.
Sirius: How can you be so sure it's a good idea?
Remus: Why in Merlin's name would this be a bad idea?

Remus: To his knowledge, Harry doesn't have any idea why Sirius hasn't been around, no more than he knew why Remus was absent from his life for nearly five months.
Remus: Remus has done the math, there is no way Harry has knowledge of the crime Sirius was wrongfully imprisoned for or what the extended circumstances were behind his parents' deaths.
Remus: But then, he's also rather glad it will be he and Sirius who tell him."
18,17477249,Remus,Sirius,"Remus: What was it like, when you saw him again? I know you took him from the Dursleys- thank Merlin for that- but what happened? How did it go?
Sirius: *tilts his head to the side*
Remus: Dumbledore and McGonagall don't think any less of him after telling them about his odd dreams that sent him to Little Whinging and then later on a rat hunt, at least nothing that they've said to his face, so there's not really any reason to worry that Sirius might think him crazy. He's still not sure what he thinks of the dreams himself. Were Lily and James visiting him from beyond or was his subconscious trying to kick his conscious mind in the arse and get done what desperately needed doing.
Sirius: *blinks once and then laughs*
Remus: I wouldn't expect any less. She never said exactly what I so spectacularly mucked up but, from the moment I woke up, I knew what she wanted me to do. Naturally, I fell out of bed, pulled on some trousers, and apparated to Little Whinging so haphazardly I think I'm lucky I didn't splinch myself and bleed out right there on Petunia and Vernon's front lawn.
Sirius: Merlin, I can picture it now, the absolute fit Petunia would have upon finding a wizard bleeding out on her perfectly manicured lawn.
Remus: Can you imagine if I made it through becoming a werewolf before the age of seven and then later one of the..."
19,17477249,Remus,Sirius,"Remus: I want to talk to you, *grimaces* Can you imagine if I made it through becoming a werewolf before the age of seven and then later one of the worst wars in wizarding history only to be murdered by Petunia for bleeding on her daisies?
Sirius: You'd die a second time when Lily found you in the afterlife, *laughs*
Remus: Well, thankfully that's not what happened. Instead, I think I must have paced up and down Privet Drive for a solid hour before Harry toddled outside.
Sirius: *inhales sharply*
Remus: I think my heart nearly stopped when he spotted me loitering down the road.
Sirius: *fully engrossed in his tale*
Remus: Did that hag of a sister make it difficult for you to see him?
Remus: *laughs* I'm sure she would have given me hell if she had the opportunity but Harry took off long before Petunia even knew who I was. She thought Harry was running toward a vagrant until I introduced myself. I was stunned to see him sprinting at me full speed, screaming Moony! Moony! Moony! at the top of his little lungs and I completely froze right there.
Remus: I'd like to see you do any better, *jabbing him in the ribs*
Sirius: Petunia let you just march off right then? Moony! Did you kidnap Harry Potter?
Remus: *gaze drops to the floor* I perhaps, might have, maybe, possibly suggested that if Petunia didn't let me in to see how Harry was faring then something unfortunate could potentially befall her perfect suburban life.
Sirius: *throws his arms up in the arm* Moony you manipulative bastard!
Remus: Let's just say I was less than impressed by what I found at 4 Privet Drive and Harry's been with me ever since.
Sirius: Tell me about him, *in a rush* Please.
Remus: *smiles* Every single day is different, *begins* One morning we're coloring ferociously, the next, we absolutely detest coloring- can't stand it! He'll be affronted I even offered him the crayons.
Sirius: *blinks, then grins and nearly barks a laugh*
Remus: Harry wants to be helping all the time. Unfortunately, more often than not, that means cleaning things up that don't need cleaning. It took me a solid week to find where he put his shoes once he decided that they didn't belong next to the door any longer.
Sirius: *snickers* And where were they?
Remus: Tucked neatly inside the dress shoes you forced upon me for James and Lily's wedding! How he found them when they were shoved so far back in the closet, I'll never know. Let alone what he concocted up in his little mind that convinced him that his shoes were meant to be inside a pair of mine. I had to transfigure him a pair in..."
20,17477249,Sirius,Remus,"Sirius: And where were they? *snickers*
Remus: Tucked neatly inside the dress shoes you forced upon me for James and Lily's wedding! How he found them when they were shoved so far back in the closet, I'll never know. Let alone what he concocted up in his little mind that convinced him that his shoes were meant to be inside a pair of mine. I had to transfigure him a pair in the meantime!
Sirius: That's possibly the funniest thing I've ever heard and by far the most adorable.
Remus: Ah yes, then there's that. He's the picture of innocence! He could light the house on fire and I'd be inclined to pat him on the back and tell him job well done. Everyone he meets is charmed immediately by his big eyes and smile. He doesn't say much yet, mostly just Moony and the occasional no or bye-bye but still, he wins everyone over in minutes. *Remus doesn't bother hiding the pride in his tone.*
Sirius: *laughter emanates from his chest* He's already following in our footsteps! Who would have-
Arthur: Morning Remus!
Remus: *nods vaguely in Arthur's direction, distracted by the intensity by which Sirius is looking at Harry.*
Sirius: Harry, *says reverently*
Harry: *staring at Sirius*
Sirius: Hello Harry, *holding on equally tight* Oh, how I've missed you.
Arthur: Well boys looks like you've got this under control. I'll leave you to it.
Remus: *smiles weakly in Arthur's direction*
Arthur: Thank you for keeping him at yours last night. We'll be sure to have you all over when we're settled.
Remus: *smiles weakly in Arthur's direction*
Arthur: We'll look forward to it. We're only a floo away if you need anything.
Remus: *smiles weakly in Arthur's direction*
Remus: *grins stupidly at the scene in front of him*"
21,17477249,Remus,Arthur,"Remus: We're only a floo away if you need anything. *Arthur and Molly Weasley are saints as far as Remus is concerned. The help they've been through Peter's trial and the aftermath is priceless though Remus plans to pay them back in any way he can for as long as it takes.* There's another loud pop and then it's just the three of them, still all packed onto the sofa. It's painfully domestic, more so when Remus considers that they're both barely in their twenties, but he's positively certain that nothing could make him happier than he feels right now.
Harry: Moony! It's Padfoot!
Remus: Indeed, Harry! Aren't we lucky? *Remus says ruffling his hair with one hand.*
Harry: *nods and wraps his arms around Sirius' neck and squishing his own face to Sirius'.*
Sirius: Not weak, this one.
Harry: Moony.
Remus: *knows how to take a hint and closes the few inches of space between himself and Sirius. He throws his arms around the SiriusandHarry lump and tucks his face close to Harry and Sirius' own. Harry pats him on the top of the head once-twice-three times letting Remus know his choice of action was indeed the correct answer.*
Sirius: I think I'm the lucky one here, *although it comes out kind of garbled with Harry still pressed to his face.*
Remus: I guess we'll have to call it a draw.

Epilogue
Harry: Moony sleepy?
Remus: Mmmm.
Harry: Moony sick?
Remus: Mmmm.
Harry: Padfoot?
Remus: No, 'm fine. Promise.
Harry: Moony.
Sirius: Harry! Moony needs his rest. We need to let him alone a little while longer.
Harry: *gently pats Remus on the chest and tries to shake his head from where it's wedged between Remus' arm and side.*
Sirius: Right, if we want Moony to feel better then we need to let him rest up and lie in. I promise he'll be better in no time.
Harry: Moony."
22,17477249,Remus,Sirius,"Remus: *pats Remus on the chest and tries to shake his head from where it’s wedged between Remus’ arm and side* “Moony.”
Sirius: “Right, if we want Moony to feel better then we need to let him rest up and lie in. I promise he’ll be better in no time.”
Remus: *shakes head* “Moony.”
Sirius: “We’ll just be in the other room. We’ll be right here if needs anything, promise.”
Remus: *says, eyes still firmly closed* “Ah, just give it up Padfoot and come lay down with us already.”
Sirius: *another few moments of silence pass before there’s another dip in the bed and Sirius wriggles under the blankets* “Okay there Moony?”
Remus: *asks softly* “Never better, Padfoot. And he means it."
