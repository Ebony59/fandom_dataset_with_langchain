0,17732855,Hadrian Gaunt,Molly Weasley,"Hadrian Gaunt: Hello, my name is Hadrian Gaunt, and there is a dark magic object in your house that I'm here to get rid of, if you'd be so kind.
Molly: What do you mean, dark object? How do you even know it's here?
Hadrian Gaunt: I'm not quite sure what type, I just know there's something dark here, and if you'd allow me in I could get rid of it.
Molly: Hadrian Gaunt, did you say?
Hadrian Gaunt: Yes, Ma'am.
Molly: Would you like something to drink, Mr. Gaunt? Or to eat? Lunchtime is just around the corner...
Hadrian Gaunt: No, don't apologize, really. It's nice. It's like...it's like home.
Molly: Are you alright, dear? Are you sure you don't want something to eat? It's no trouble.
Hadrian Gaunt: No, thank you, Mrs. Weasley, I'm okay."
1,17732855,Molly,Man,"Molly: Are you alright, dear? Are you sure you don't want something to eat? It's no trouble.
Man: No, thank you, Mrs. Weasley, I'm okay.
Man: *draws his wand from his sleeve, holding it readily*
Man: Accio rat missing a finger.
Molly: *blinks, thinking that quite an odd thing to call to oneself—and wondering what that had to do with a dark object in her home—and she let out a little shout of surprise when a rat flew through the air and landed in the man's waiting fist.*
Man: *uses his wand to draw up a quick and powerful protective circle, throwing the rat inside before he closed it.*
Molly: *wincing as the rat screamed in protest and ran at the barriers, begging to be let out.*
Man: *murmurs a quiet spell the elder witch couldn't hear, causing a blue light to glow at the end of his wand.*
Molly: *gasps, her eyes going wide and a hand flying to her mouth.*
Molly: Peter Pettigrew was supposed to be dead. He'd been killed by Sirius Black after Black had betrayed them all. And yet there he was, disguised as a rat in her home.
Peter Pettigrew: I-I-I— I—oh, thank you so much! Sirius Black, he-he trapped me in that form, made me unable t-t-to get help. So-so thank you, kind sir!
Gaunt: I have a vial of Veritaserum that I will be using to ensure your truthfulness when the Aurors arrive, Mr. Pettigrew. Until then, I'd advise you to stay. Silent. I'm more inclined to be rough with you than fair, and I don't think tempting me towards harming you by lying is a good idea.
Pettigrew: Please, Mrs. Weasley—Molly. We—we were in th-the Order together! This—this man is a stranger. H-he might even be a-a Death Eater, here to frame me!
Gaunt: Be silent before I make you be silent.
Molly: You said something about Aurors, Mr. Gaunt?"
2,17732855,Molly,Gaunt,"Molly: You said something about Aurors? *Molly inquired, drawing Gaunt's attention. His eyes flashed to her, and her breath was taken away at the grief in his gaze, the bitter anger, and Molly wanted nothing more than to hug him. Instead, she sent him a kind smile.* Aurors, Mr. Gaunt?
Gaunt: I...? *he blinked at her a few times and then rolled his shoulders, taking a deep breath. Between one moment and the next he looked far calmer.* Yes, Aurors. I sent word to them that there was a Death Eater fugitive in the area, and that he was hiding in the Weasley household, unbeknownst to all of you. They should be arriving right...
Gaunt: What was that? *Pettigrew cried out, wiping urgently at his mouth like he could undo swallowing the liquid.*
Gaunt: Veritaserum, *Gaunt told him, baring his teeth in vicious satisfaction. Told you—you're going to tell them everything you've done.*
Gaunt: What is your name? *he asked with the calm surety of someone who was finally getting what they wanted.*
Pettigrew: P-Peter Pettigr-grew, *the man in the circle stuttered out fearfully. Hunched over like he was, Molly was reminded of the fact that he was barely twenty-two years old. The thought made her heart clench.*
Gaunt: And were you the Secret Keeper for James and Lily Potter? *Gaunt continued.*
Pettigrew: Yes, I-I was.
Gaunt: And did you betray them to Voldemort?
Pettigrew: Yes.
Gaunt: And did you then frame Sirius Black—an innocent man—for your crimes?
Pettigrew: Yes, I did, and I'm so sorry, it-it was a mistake, but it's in the past now, an-and—
Auror: Peter Pettigrew, you are under arrest; do not resist, or stronger methods will be employed to apprehend you. *The man glanced at Gaunt, nodding his head, and Gaunt immediately dropped the protective circle, freeing Pettigrew.*
Auror: Nice job, seriously. This...well, this changes everything. Good work.
Molly: Well, that was...that was extraordinary.
Gaunt: No more evil rats in your walls, *he said with a chuckle. Well, at least none with a greater motivation that chewing on your flowers.*
Molly: Now could I interest you in some lunch, Mr. Gaunt?
Gaunt: Call me Hadrian, *he murmured in reply, cracking his neck. He glanced around her home one last time with a fond expression, and then turned to her with a smile. I thank you for allowing me into your home, Mrs. Weasley.*"
3,17732855,Hadrian Gaunt,Molly Weasley,"Hadrian Gaunt: Now could I interest you in some lunch, Mr. Gaunt? *cracking his neck* I thank you for allowing me into your home, Mrs. Weasley, and I hope this hasn't disrupted your day too much.
Molly Weasley: *laughs* No, dear, it's quite alright.
Molly Weasley: *telling Albus Dumbledore* all about the strange young man who appeared out of nowhere and had knowledge no one else had even guessed at.
Remus Lupin: Remus Lupin? My name is Hadrian Gaunt; might we talk? I have some good news for you.
Hadrian Gaunt: You might want to sit down, *glancing at one of the rickety kitchen chairs* Yesterday afternoon it was discovered that Peter Pettigrew is alive.
Remus Lupin: Oh my god. He's innocent. He didn't betray us.
Hadrian Gaunt: Yes, he did. He framed Sirius and then he hid out in his Animagus form to fake his death. He confessed under Veritaserum to all his crimes. He'll be taking Sirius' cell in Azkaban immediately.
Remus Lupin: Wait, why didn't he...if they chose Peter as Secret Keeper instead, why didn't Sirius tell me? Did he think I was the spy?
Hadrian Gaunt: To be fair, you believed he was the spy, as well. I feel like you can both just forgive each other for that, yeah?
Remus Lupin: I have to go get him. When is he leaving Azkaban? How do I...can I be there?
Hadrian Gaunt: *smiles*"
4,17732855,Gaunt,Remus,"Gaunt: To be fair, Gaunt said, his tone wry, you believed he was the spy, as well. I feel like you can both just forgive each other for that, yeah?
Remus: Remus laughed again, relief making him giddy. Sirius was being released. I have to go get him, he breathed. He looked to Gaunt. When is he leaving Azkaban? How do I...can I be there?
Gaunt: Gaunt smiled, his eyes crinkling happily. Go take a shower and shave.
Remus: Remus blinked at him, suddenly offended. I beg your pardon?
Gaunt: The other man laughed, soft and kind. I don't mean to offend. I simply meant that it's been a very hard five months, for both Sirius and you—he's going to be tired and stressed, and seeing you the same way won't help him. Shower, shave, eat something, and go pick him up looking strong and alive.
Remus: For a moment, Remus just stared at Gaunt, taken aback. He was right; the werewolf was well aware of how run-down he'd come to look these last few months, and he could practically hear Sirius making jokes about it in his mind, the laughter doing nothing to cover the genuine worry in his eyes. Remus didn't want Sirius to worry about him, not after the Animagus had just spent five months in Azkaban.
Remus: With a sigh, Remus nodded, sending Gaunt a grateful smile. Right, yes. You can...make yourself at home. I'll be out in a bit.
Gaunt: Gaunt nodded back, sitting down on the small, ratty couch in the living room. Remus winced briefly—seeing that richly-dressed man on the falling-to-pieces sofa made him feel awkward and poor—but Gaunt looked perfectly content, examining the contents of Remus' bookshelf with a curious, peaceful expression.
Remus: It was probably a trick of the light, but Remus thought he saw a hint of tears in the man's eyes.

Roger: Roger Smyth was pretty sure he wasn't paid enough to deal with Hadrian Gaunt on a Monday morning.
Gaunt: The man was a force to be reckoned with, especially considering that before a week ago he'd barely existed, and now suddenly he was catching thought-dead traitors and getting thought-traitor innocent men out of Azkaban. Any time someone put up a slight argument, Gaunt easily steamrolled right over them, somehow getting people to shut up and do as they were told, even though he wasn't their boss.
Roger: Roger hadn't seen anyone except Albus Dumbledore do that to Ministry officials before. It was almost an artform. It was bloody terrifying.
Roger: And so here he was, eight in the fucking morning on a Monday, waiting at Azkaban's gates because somehow Hadrian Gaunt had managed to get permission to be here to greet Black, and somehow Roger had ended up with the job of escorting him.
Roger: But not just him, no. Gaunt also got permission to bring a fucking werewolf along.
Roger: Fucking ridiculous.
Gaunt: Out of the corner of his eye, Roger could tell Gaunt was looking at him, and he thus kept his eyes firmly forward. The werewolf was twitching anxiously, looking like he was barely restraining himself from storming the gates. Gaunt, in complete contrast, looked so utterly calm, as if going to Azkaban was just a regular occurrence for him.
Roger: Roger, on the other hand? Well, being this close to a horde of dementors made him severely uncomfortable.
Gaunt: Mr. Smyth? Gaunt called, and Roger steeled himself, turning to look at the man with what he hoped was a polite expression. This man had caused quite a commotion at the ministry, and thus made Roger's life very difficult.
Roger: Yes, Lord Gaunt?
Gaunt: Would you like a sugar quill? I have a few in my bag, and I'm trying to eat less sugar, Gaunt said, smiling kindly.
Roger: Roger blinked in surprise, and then blinked again. Sugar quills were his favorite candy. Had been since he was a kid. How the fuck—?
Roger: I...yes, thank you, Roger said hesitantly, and he suddenly realized that Gaunt did not have a bag with him, and so no place for sugar quills.
Gaunt: But, proving Roger wrong, Gaunt pulled out his small, billfold wallet, opened it up, and pulled out two sugar quills, large and completely intact. They couldn't have fit in the tiny area.
Roger: Roger blinked again, and couldn't help but feel seriously impressed. After a moment's hesitation, he reached out and took the candy from Gaunt's outstretched hand. Right. Thank you.
Gaunt: Gaunt smiled and nodded."
5,17732855,Lupin,Gaunt,"Lupin: You're—what?
Gaunt: Currently Harry is living with his aunt and uncle in Little Whinging. They are not...exceptionally nice people, and now that you have been released from prison, and are listed in the Potters' will as a primary guardian should something happen to them, I'm sure it will be no problem to have your godson in your care come the end of the week. I just need to discuss the...specifics with Headmaster Dumbledore first.
Black: Who are you?
Gaunt: Someone with the ability to right some wrongs.
Roger: Take...it?
Gaunt: Lord Black and Mr. Lupin are likely to want to go home now. I'll be in touch soon, but I figured that a capable man such as yourself is perfectly willing to make sure they get off this island alright, with the full support of the ministry behind them.
Black: Yes, of course. Thank you for your aid, Lord Gaunt. I can take it from here.
Gaunt: You'll be seeing Harry very soon, if I have anything to say about it. I'm very good at getting my way.
Albus: Ever since Albus heard the name Hadrian Gaunt whispered through the halls of the ministry, ever since Molly Weasley called him and told him about the stranger's accomplishments, the Hogwarts headmaster had really been wanting to meet this mystery man.
Albus: Which was, of course, when the mysterious wizard decided to show up."
6,17732855,Albus,Hadrian,"Albus: Afternoon.
Hadrian: Afternoon.
Albus: What can we help you with, Mr...
Hadrian: Gaunt.
Albus: Nice to meet you as well, Mr. Gaunt.
Filius: Great day for a game, eh?
Hadrian: It is indeed.
Hadrian: I hope you won't mind me stealing the headmaster for a moment, Madame Pomfrey; there are a few things I need to talk to him about.
Poppy: Oh, not at all, dear, not at all!
Albus: This way, Lord Gaunt; we can talk in my office.
Albus: You've made quite the impression lately.
Hadrian: I've gotten that impression, yes.
Albus: I did hear someone compare your ways to mine.
Albus: You should just ask.
Albus: What can I do for you, Lord Gaunt?
Hadrian: I'd like to discuss the guardianship of Harry James Potter."
7,17732855,Hadrian,Harry James Potter,"Hadrian: I'd like to discuss the guardianship of Harry James Potter.
Albus: Mr. Potter is in the care of his aunt and uncle, considering they are the closest relation after the death of his parents. What needs to be discussed about that?
Hadrian: You've placed him there because you believe the blood wards will protect him. Not because they're deserving of custody.
Hadrian: And now that Lord Black has been cleared of all charges and released from Azkaban, Mr. Potter should immediately transfer residences, considering James and Lily Potter put him as the guardian should they die, with Mr. Remus Lupin behind Lord Black should Lord Black be unable to fulfill his duties.
Albus: Did you know Lily and James?
Hadrian: Not personally, no. I'm just...a stickler for not breaking wills. So! I assume you have no problem writing a recommendation for the changing custody? You have quite a large amount of influence and it will speed things along exponentially.
Albus: I think some hesitation is warranted. Sirius Black just got out of Azkaban, which I imagine is a very traumatic place. And Remus Lupin has been struggling himself as of late. Currently Harry Potter is in a stable home environment. I don't know if it's the best idea to remove him from his aunt and uncle, only to place him in what could be a challenging home.
Hadrian: A challenging home? A stable environment?
Albus: Yes, are you alright, Lord Gaunt?
Hadrian: I'm fine. I simply disagree with you. And what was it that Professor McGonagall told you all those years—sorry, months—ago? That the Dursleys are the worst sort of muggles? I don't believe that's a good household for Harry Potter.
Albus: How could you possibly know that?
Hadrian: Has your DADA position opened up yet?
Albus: The Defense Against the Dark Arts position. The job is a revolving door because of a jinx, which means you'll be needing a new professor for the next school year. I was simply wondering if the current one had already forfeited their position or if I have to wait to move my stuff in?
Albus: Just to clarify, I know absolutely nothing about you except your name, you popped up very suddenly out of nowhere with knowledge no one else had, you are extremely powerful and yet hold no magical history, and now you are assuming that I'm going to just give you a position in my school? Not to be blunt, my boy, but why in Merlin's name do you think I would do such a..."
8,17732855,Hadrian Gaunt,Albus Dumbledore,"bus: Just to clarify, he said, chuckling, I know absolutely nothing about you except your name, you popped up very suddenly out of nowhere with knowledge no one else had, you are extremely powerful and yet hold no magical history, and now you are assuming that I'm going to just give you a position in my school? Not to be blunt, my boy, but why in Merlin's name do you think I would do such a thing?
Hadrian: *tilted his head, watching him thoughtfully, and then he pulled a few items out of his pockets and put them on the desk.*
bus: *There were very few times in his life that Albus Dumbledore was truly at a loss for words. But in this instance, staring down at three mangled objects that held the aura of destroyed dark magic—well, he honestly couldn't think of a single thing to say.*
Hadrian: There's four more, Hadrian said quietly. I know where each of them are—well, where three of them are. The fourth is more of a moving target which makes it harder, but I have a general idea. I also have the capability to destroy them, case in point what you see before you. You're right that you don't know me, but I will keep this school and its students safe.
bus: Are these...were these Horcruxes? Albus asked, his hand reaching out and running over them in the air.
Hadrian: *nodded slowly. Tom Riddle's. Voldemort's.*
bus: *Albus looked up sharply, searching the younger wizard's expression for any hint of deception. The implications of such a statement...Albus sorely wished he could look into the boy's mind, see what he knew, determine what was of value and what wasn't. But unless he wanted to force his way in—thus breaking various laws and harming someone unnecessarily—then a look into Hadrian Gaunt's mind wasn't going to happen.*
bus: So you're saying that Voldemort created seven Horcruxes? Albus asked slowly. He split his soul into eight pieces?
Hadrian: *just nodded, not saying anything, allowing Albus time to process.*
bus: How did you find these? Albus asked. How do you know with certainty that he created seven?
Hadrian: You have many questions about me, Hadrian said, not answering the one just asked. Many questions about the way I do things, where I come from, how I know things, why I'm suddenly here and invested. Maybe you'll even be suspicious of me, for a time. And I'm sorry to say, but I'm not going to answer your questions.
bus: *Albus opened his mouth to object. Hadrian continued before he could.*
Hadrian: I show you these as proof that I am not the enemy, and that I will do everything in my power to ensure that Voldemort never returns. I am here to protect the next generation and to fix wrongs that have been left uncorrected.
Hadrian: And right now I'm here to fix your wrong and protect Harry James Potter. Sirius Black and Remus Lupin will make excellent guardians, and I will fight you tooth and nail to get Harry removed from the Dursleys. So. With the limited knowledge you currently have on me and my actions, what is your decision?
bus: *For a long moment, Albus just watched him. This wasn't how he'd expected his day (week, month, year) to go. Hadrian Gaunt had shown up in a practical puff of smoke and gotten right to work. He had no known background. He had knowledge no one on the Light side had, but that the Death Eaters might. He was fiercely protective of a child he never met. He found and destroyed Horcruxes like it was natural to do so. He carried the name of a dark, dead family.*
bus: Our current DADA professor Andrea Shaldon has turned in her letter of resignation for the end of the school year because her father has health issues, and needs looking after. So yes, the position is open for the coming year. You may have it. I will also write a letter to the ministry urging for the immediate legal transfer of custody of Harry Potter from his aunt and uncle and to his godfather.
Hadrian: *let out a slow breath, almost shaky. The man's words had been confident but he hadn't*"
9,17732855,Draco,Harry,"Draco: You look ridiculous.
Harry: I suppose I do, yes. Hermione told me it's tradition, I have to wear it.
Draco: Granger is a mud—... muggleborn, and has never had to attend a wizard function such as this. I'm surprised you're even in the right garment.
Harry: And yet in the right garment I am.
Draco: I hated these things when I was younger."
10,17732855,Alice,Bob,
11,17732855,Hadrian Gaunt,Narcissa,"Hadrian Gaunt: That's Veritaserum, he explained, and Narcissa's breath caught. I figure you're smart enough to set him up somehow to confess to the right people—you can always act as a witness in a trial instead, if you wish, but I just thought this might take some of the burden off of you.
Narcissa: stared down at the glass vial for a few moments, and then nodded slowly before looking back up at the man.
Narcissa: Why did you come here? she asked, meaning more than just her home.
Hadrian Gaunt: I have a million answers to that question. A million reasons that I made this decision. I didn't make it lightly. But at the core of it all, the one reason that really matters is—because I could. He offered her a wry smile. I hope you can keep this to yourself, yes?
Narcissa: was nodding before he'd even finished asking. Of course, she said, her tone almost offended. You've just shown me a better path and given me the tools to get rid of the obstacle—I won't reveal your secret. She examined him for a moment. She understood now why he'd looked slightly familiar to her. What do I call you, then?
Hadrian Gaunt: smiled, wide and bright. Hadrian Gaunt, at your service. I must say it's been a pleasure to formally meet you.
Narcissa: got to his feet, and Narcissa followed his lead. He kissed the back of her hand like a gentleman and then turned to go.
Narcissa: May I ask you something? she inquired, one thing still burning in her mind. Just one question, before you go.
Hadrian Gaunt: looked at her critically for a moment and then nodded. Alright. What is it?
Narcissa: How did you know what I'd do here? Narcissa asked. You let me see inside your mind because you were so sure that I would do whatever I could to stop that from happening. How did you know that I'd choose Draco over Lucius, over everything?
Hadrian Gaunt: smile was gentle, and even caring. Because you did choose Draco over everything; I didn't think sixteen years would change anything.
Narcissa: stared at him, wanting to ask so many more things, but she restrained herself. It was a pleasure to meet you as well, Lord Gaunt. I hope to see you again.
Hadrian Gaunt: laughed. Oh, I think that's more than likely. And if I may offer a word of advice?
Narcissa: Go ahead, the witch agreed cautiously.
Hadrian Gaunt: Make amends with your sister, Andromeda Tonks. Narcissa's head jerked back in surprise at the words. If you want to shape Draco better, frankly if you want to shape a lot better, reach out to her. You have a niece, you know; and she has a nephew. It might be nice, is all I'm saying.
Narcissa: He shrugged, and then turned quickly, disapparating from her living room, leaving Narcissa Malfoy with a vial of Veritaserum and so many plans for the future.

Severus Snape: How did you get in here? Severus demanded, pushing his hair back. The Potter-look-alike stared back at him with a determined expression, his arms crossed over his chest. He must've deflected the potion master's curse, because the man most certainly wasn't missing a limb.
Potter-look-alike: You're such an asshole, you know that? the man told him bluntly.
Severus Snape: looked at him incredulously. This wizard broke into his room, poured a bucket of water on his head, and had the nerve to call him an asshole?
Severus Snape: Get the fuck out, Severus snapped, no longer caring about why the other wizard was there. It was probably one of Dumbledore's newest attempts to get him out and about, or whatever. Severus had to commend the originality at least.
Potter-look-alike: No, the man said stubbornly, and didn't offer anything else.
Severus Snape: They stared at each other for a long time, and Severus felt his outrage growing. It was a Saturday. Why did he have to be bothered by one of Dumbledore's pet projects on a Saturday? It was one of the only fucking days he got mostly to himself."
12,17732855,Severus,the man,"Severus: So we're just going to do this, then? Stand here in my bedroom with me soaking wet in nothing but my underwear, you a complete stranger who's just broken in and disturbed my sleep? That's how we're going to spend Saturday morning?
The man: It's a good look.
Severus: No. Fucking. Way. Was this wizard actually making fun of him after all of that shit? The goddamn nerve—
The man: You're an asshole. I never got a chance to really tell you that, you know? You are so awful to everyone you meet. And I get it, traumatic, abusive childhoods really fucking suck, but it doesn't give you an excuse to bully children. It doesn't give you an excuse to be so horrible that you become a child's boggart! Do you even understand how fucked up that is, Severus? Do you understand that that goes beyond being mean and goes firmly into evil territory?
The man: And you just hate everyone, even those who stand by your side. You show nothing but disdain for people who time and time again try to stand by your side, try to fight for you. You ignore the good deeds of others because you're so consumed by your fucking heartbreak or whatever when you're responsible for it all in the first place! Have you ever made an attempt to move past all this childhood bullshit? Did it ever—for a single fucking second—occur to you that James Potter was a dickwad but he wasn't evil incarnate, and you were the one to make the decision to go follow someone who wanted to kill everyone like your ex-best friend?
The man: You've been through a lot in your life, I get that, I do, and I have a lot of respect for all that you've accomplished. But it doesn't excuse all of the shit you've pulled, Severus. Not a single bloody moment of it. So I'm going to make sure you're better than all that this time.
Severus: ...Do you want some tea?
The man: I, er,
Severus: Ten points from whatever your house was for having an inarticulate alumnus.
Severus: He heard a pause and then a snort of amusement before footsteps started following him. Severus went about putting water on to boil, and, after a moment's consideration, took out some biscuits as well. He could feel the other wizard watching him as he went through the motions but he didn't turn around. He didn't know what this shakiness he was feeling was, but he wasn't ready for the man to start insulting him again, which he was afraid would happen if he met his eyes."
13,17732855,Severus,Hadrian Gaunt,"Severus: Sorry for shouting.
Man: You didn't quite shout. Though you did come close.
Severus: Who are you to say I deserved it? We've never met, and yet you broke into my room only to shout at me—
Man: You said I didn't shout—
Severus: Shout at me about things that make no sense. What child's boggart am I, hmm? I'm not even teaching yet—I haven't actually interacted with a child since I was one.
Severus: Do I get a name, at least? Yours, preferably, in case you were preparing some sarcastic comment about a name.
Man: Hadrian Gaunt. That's my name.
Severus: So why are you here, Hadrian Gaunt? It couldn't just have been to spew nonsense.
Man: Just because you didn't understand my accusations doesn't make them nonsense.
Severus: What year were you born?
Man: I'm twenty-five years old.
Severus: That's not what I asked.
Severus: You're from the future.
Man: What? No, no, no of course not. Why would you even say such a thing? That's not...no.
Severus: No? Tell me—was I your boggart?
Man: I was never afraid of you. You were an asshole, and it was very clear that if you wished to hurt us you would, but afraid? No, Severus. Fear was never something I felt about you."
14,17732855,Severus,Gaunt,"Severus: You were an asshole, and it was very clear that if you wished to hurt us you would, but afraid? No, Severus. Fear was never something I felt about you.
Severus: What year did you come from?
Severus: Does anyone else know the truth?
Severus: You did!
Gaunt: Oh, come on, Gaunt said, laughter in his voice, as Severus stormed off towards the living room. I'm sorry, but I'm still making up for years of abuse, okay? A little teasing is warranted.
Severus: Abuse, Severus said. He was going for even, but his voice sounded hollow even to his own ears. I abused my students. I was truly horrid enough to be someone's boggart. How bad...?
Severus: Why would I do that? he murmured.
Gaunt: Because you're angry, Gaunt said simply. Because you've gone through a lot and you refuse to let yourself feel broken by any of it, so instead you got mad and lashed out at everyone. It's a common coping mechanism, really; anger in the place of grief. That doesn't excuse any of your actions—it really, really doesn't—but it makes it understandable."
15,17732855,Gaunt,Severus,"Gaunt: I know you hate James Potter for all that he did while you were in school, and that's justified, because he was a bully who made your life hell. But an important fact is that he grew up and became a better person. He fought for the rights of everyone, fought to protect the world, and stopped being so much of an asshole. You though...You started as a nice kid, and grew up to be nothing more than a bully.
Severus: Why are you telling me all this? Why do you care?
Gaunt: Because you need to be better this time. Because I'm not going to let you become that hateful creature you were when I was at Hogwarts. Everything is new to you right now, and you have a chance to be better. Don't become the monster in everyone's story, Severus; you have the capacity to be so much more than that, if you only tried.
Severus: I'm the reason she's dead. She is dead because of something I did.
Gaunt: Yes, she is. You chose to sacrifice her husband and son in the hope that Voldemort would spare her, which was so very, very naïve of you. What you did was wrong. So much of what you've done has been wrong, Severus. So take this opportunity to make up for your sins, not add to them.
Severus: What do you want me to do? How could I possibly..?
Gaunt: Well, you start with therapy.
Severus: Pardon?
Gaunt: Remember how I mentioned speaking to Dumbledore? Well, he's the sole reason you're not being sent to Azkaban, as I'm sure you're aware. It is only his word keeping you free.
Severus: Yes. What does that—
Gaunt: So I spoke to Dumbledore, and it seems that the ministry now wants a bit more from you. Your freedom is now dependent upon you attending weekly therapy sessions.
Severus: You can't be serious.
Gaunt: No, quite serious. The ministry is stepping up its game, it seems.
Severus: Why in Merlin's name are you doing this?
Gaunt: I've already told you. It's not my fault you don't want to accept the reason or the solution.
Severus: Fine.
Gaunt: Great! And I assume you'll be checking in to make sure I go?
Severus: Oh, I know you'll go, I don't have to push you. But we will be seeing a lot more of each other, Severus—Dumbledore just hired me, after all."
16,17732855,Sirius,Lucius Malfoy,"Sirius: Slowly but surely, the world began to calm down. More and more Death Eaters were caught every day, each morning the Daily Prophet proclaiming a new monster locked away for good. When Sirius read about Lucius Malfoy having confessed and sentenced to Azkaban, he actually crowed with joy.

Kreacher: It's my job.
Hadrian: I know. And I commend your loyalty, because it's truly incredible. You've done so much to honor what he would've wanted. I understand your reluctance to give it to me, after everything Regulus went through to get it. But you must understand—I can destroy it, Kreacher. I've done it before. The locket wasn't the only one made; there were others, and now there aren't.
Hadrian: You know what it is, yes?
Kreacher: Of course.
Hadrian: Regulus died to take this away from Voldemort. You know that better than most. So let me help you complete your task, Kreacher. Let me fulfill Regulus' last wish. The wizarding world might not know what he's done for them, but we do. Let me make sure it sticks.
Kreacher: Here, then. And if you dare to betray Master Regulus' memory—
Hadrian: I won't. I'll destroy this, and complete the mission. Would you like to keep the remains of it after?
Kreacher: No. Bad luck. Best to throw away, let it all wash behind us. Keep Master Regulus' secrets.
Hadrian: Thank you.

Hadrian: Er, Sirius. Come down for a midnight snack?
Sirius: Did you know my brother?
Hadrian: No! No, of course not. I—
Sirius: Hadrian, don't lie to me. How did you know Regulus? Why didn't you mention it? Is that why you fought to get me out of Azkaban, loyalty to my brother? Did you—
Hadrian: Sirius! I never met your brother. I didn't know him! But I knew something about him that no one else did. Come on, this is a sitting down kind of conversation.

Sirius: Tell me what's going on, Hadrian.
Hadrian: Do you know what a Horcrux is?
Sirius: A Horcrux is made when you split your soul and put part of it into an object. Horcruxes are dark, dark magic, and horrifying as well. The catalyst for the spell is murder, and splitting the soul... It changes you, chips away at you. It also makes you pretty close to immortal."

Sirius: A Horcrux is made when you split your soul and put part of it into an object. Horcruxes are dark, dark magic, and horrifying as well. The catalyst for the spell is murder, and splitting the soul... It changes you, chips away at you. It also makes you pretty close to immortal.
Hadrian: Are you saying Regulus—?
Hadrian: No, Regulus never did anything like that. But Voldemort did.
Hadrian: You were right that at one point Regulus started to want to back out of Voldemort's service, but it wasn't because he was panicking. He realized what it truly meant to be a Death Eater, and he made the incredibly brave decision to do whatever he could to ensure that Voldemort didn't get his way.
Hadrian: Regulus discovered the location of one of Voldemort's Horcruxes and he went there, bringing an exact replica of the item with him. There were traps along the way, and he had to drink a basin of what was basically the Cruciatus Curse in liquid form. The willpower to do that...
Hadrian: He gave the object to Kreacher and told him to leave immediately. Kreacher did so, and Regulus went to a surrounding lake to get something cleansing to drink, but there were Inferi in the water, and they dragged him down. Ever since then Kreacher has been trying to figure out how to destroy the Horcrux, with no success.
Hadrian: That is how your brother died, Sirius. Not weakness, but strength. A truly incredible amount of strength.
Sirius: How did you know all this? About the Horcrux, about Regulus—did Kreacher tell you all of it? Why didn't he tell me?
Hadrian: Regulus swore Kreacher to secrecy, and house-elves take their vows very seriously. And hey, just add this to the list of shit I somehow know and fix, like fucking Wormtail.
Hadrian: Goodnight Si—
Sirius: Goodnight, Harry.
Sirius: Your parents would be so proud of the man you've become. I am proud of the man you've become, and I feel privileged to know you.
Hadrian: Thank you."
