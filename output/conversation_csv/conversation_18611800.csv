0,18611800,Ginny,Andromeda,"Ginny: His face burst into a smile, and he came bounding down the stairs.
Andromeda: 'Careful!' warned Andromeda.
Ginny: Look what I can do!
Teddy: Goodness! Look at that. How long can you do that for?
Ginny: How long can you do that for?
Teddy: Hours.
Andromeda: I think it’s more like twelve seconds, isn’t it, Ted?
Teddy: Do I need to go and get my case?
Harry: No, you’re not coming to ours tonight, we just thought we’d come for a cup of tea.
Harry: Can I help?
Teddy: This can be your side, and this will be my side. We can share the tracks though, I don’t mind.
Harry: Thank you.
Harry: We actually came round because we have some exciting news, Teddy.
Teddy: Well, what will it be? A boy or a girl?
Harry: We don’t know yet. It will be nice though, won’t it? To have someone else to play with when you visit.
Teddy: Yes, maybe.
Harry: Thank you. This will look good, won’t it?
Harry: The baby will arrive after Christmas, in the spring, probably just after your birthday, actually.
Teddy: Where will it come from?
Harry: From Ginny’s tummy.
Teddy: So it’s Ginny having a baby? Not you.
Harry: Well, we’ll look after the baby together, and be baby’s mum and dad.
Teddy: Will the baby come and live here some days?
Harry: No, you and Andromeda get to keep this house all to yourselves. So when you’re sick of sharing your toys with the baby at our house, you can come back here.
Teddy: Yes.
Harry: Is that OK?
Teddy: Yes."
1,18611800,Teddy,Harry,"Teddy: 'Is that OK?’
Harry: 'Yes,’ said Teddy. He frowned. 'I can’t find the red train.’
Harry: 'Here it is.’
Ginny: 'Well at least he wasn’t upset,’ said Ginny, as they left a little over an hour later. 'You were so worried he would be.’
Harry: 'I’m a bit worried he didn’t really understand,’ said Harry. 'But I don’t know how else I could have explained it - for a five year old to understand, anyway.’
Ginny: 'He did,’ said Ginny warmly. 'He’s just such a sweet little boy, he’s not going to worry about sharing you.’ She paused, turned to face him and wrapped her arms around his waist. 'He knows he’ll still be a big part of our little family.’
Harry: 'I still can’t quite believe it,’ he said. 'A family.’
Ginny: She stretched up on her tiptoes to kiss him, and they disapparated with a crack.

Harry: 'No, no,’ Harry said calmly. 'Sit down. Come on - remember last week when you fell?’
Teddy: 'I want to sit next to Victoire-’
Harry: 'All right, but you have to promise you’ll both sit still. Here we go.’
Ron: 'Gets me out of him nicking my yorkshire pudding, more like,’ said Harry affectionately.

Andromeda: 'Teddy, what did Harry tell you? Sit down.’
Arthur: '-And they have all these separate buttons, one for each letter of the alphabet-’ Arthur was saying to Percy.
Angelina: '-Well that’s exactly what I thought,’ Angelina was saying to Ron. 'Such a strange decision, he’s not a natural chaser at all, they haven’t been the same since Whitfield started managing them-’

Harry: He realised Hermione, who was opposite, was frowning at him slightly - he couldn’t help it, he grinned at her, and she tilted her head quizzically at him.
Hermione: 'What are you two smirking at?’ Ron asked them suddenly, breaking off his conversation with Angelina.
Hermione: 'He looks far too happy,’ said Hermione, jerking her head at Harry.
Ron: 'What are you"
2,18611800,Harry,Ginny,"Hermione: What are you two smirking at? *frowning at Harry*
Ron: What are you happy about?
Ginny: Stop it. *laughing at Harry*
Ron: You're acting really weird.
Harry: No I'm not.
Hermione: *gasping* Are you...?
Harry: *glancing at Ginny* Yeah.
Ginny: You're desperate to say it, aren't you?
Harry: Yeah. *grinning*
Teddy: What's everyone looking at?
Ginny: Harry wants to tell everyone our news.
Teddy: What, about the baby?
Molly: Do you mean it? Are you...?
Ginny: *nodding at Harry* Yes, we're due a brand new Potter in the spring.
Everyone: *expressions of raised eyebrows and surprised, excited smiles*
Molly: *kissing Harry and Ginny* I'm going to be an uncle!
Bill: You're already an uncle twice over.
Harry: *laughing* Congratulations on spreading the gene pool.
Teddy: *crying, burying his face into Harry's neck*
Harry: Come on mate, let's go have a chat. *kissing Teddy on the forehead*
Hermione: *sadly* Oh."
3,18611800,Harry,Teddy,"Harry: Come on mate, let's go have a chat, *against his godson's sandy brown hair.*
Teddy: *gives a spluttered sob*
Hermione: Oh, *sadly*
Harry: It's all right, I've got him, *carried him into the living room*
Teddy: I - still - want - to be - your - godson! *gasped through his sobs*
Harry: Of course you will be, *soothingly* Ted, the baby won't replace you or mean that I don't see you, or that I'll love you any less.
Teddy: *sniffed loudly* How long will you have the baby?
Harry: Oh, Ted, *sadly* I thought you hadn't really understood on Friday - Ginny and I will be the baby's parents, he or she will always be our child, just like you'll always be our godson.
Teddy: But why? Why can't it just be me?
Harry: *hugged him close* Teddy, I won't run out of love for you, the new baby just brings more. We decided, didn't we, that it would be nice for you to have someone to play with?
Teddy: *nodded sniffily*
Harry: It's hard, for boys like us, *quietly*
Teddy: *looked up at him with his big blue eyes*
Harry: Because we worry that we're never really part of a family. But I promise, Teddy, Ginny and I love you so much - and when this baby comes we will still love you, just as much as we will love the baby.
Teddy: *gulped, and leaned his head back against Harry's chest*
Harry: I would call you my son, *softly* but I think it's important for you to always remember your mum and dad, and how much they loved you too.
Teddy: *breaths growing more steady, the sniffs becoming less frequent, and the tears had stopped falling*
Teddy: Can I name the baby?
Harry: *paused* Babies name themselves, I'm afraid, Ted.
Teddy: Do they?
Harry: Yeah. That's why you're called Teddy, because that's what you liked best when you were born, your Teddy bear.
Teddy: Oh.
Harry: But you know what, *bracingly* I reckon you'll be an excellent big brother to them, and you'll be able to be in charge of all the games.
Teddy: *nodded*"
