0,187762,John,Sherlock,"John: You've written love letters.
Sherlock: Not since secondary school, but yes.
John: This for a case?
Sherlock: No.
John: So this is for you, then. You... want me to help you write a love letter.
Sherlock: Very good, John.
John: If you want my help, it'd do you good to be nice.
Sherlock: You've done this before. And it's not as if there's anyone else I can ask.
John: All right. Bit... well, bit secondary school, though, isn't it? A love letter.
Sherlock: If you don't want to help--
John: No, I'll help. Just--give me a moment, will you? I'd like to be dressed first.
John: You've written love letters.
Sherlock: Not since secondary school, but yes."
1,187762,John,Sherlock,"John: All right. What do you want to know?
Sherlock: Everything. I have no experience in this area. I've looked at online guides, but they are all much the same. I much prefer hands-on data, as you know.
John: Right, then. Well, I don't really know what to tell you. They're actually pretty straightforward things, love letters. You just tell them why you love them.
Sherlock: But how? Surely I can't just make a bulleted list, although that would be the most efficient and legible method.
John: Well, you can, if you think the other person will like it.
Sherlock: So I should present the letter in a manner that I think is pleasing to the other person.
John: Well... yes. If you think they'd like a poem, then write a poem. If you think they'd like a numbered list, then write a numbered list.
Sherlock: I see.
John: Erm. Well. Be loving. Sentimental. Tell them why you love them, how much you think about them. The moment you fell in love with them, if you remember it. It helps if you're a bit down on yourself, talk about how you're not worthy, that sort of thing. Flatter the other person. Use nice paper. And your best handwriting, of course.
Sherlock: Is that all?
John: I dunno. Like I said, it's been a long time. Do you want me to read over your letter? That'd probably be easier.
Sherlock: No.
John: All right, all right. Well, let me know if you have any more questions.
Sherlock: *bathroom door banged open*"
2,187762,Sherlock,John,"Sherlock: The online guides recommend a more sentimental salutation, such as 'My Dearest' or 'My Beloved,' but bearing in mind your advice, I'm really not certain how the recipient would take being addressed as my beloved.
John: I'd be a bit creeped, myself. I mean, do they know you at all?
Sherlock: You would? Marvelous. *slams the door shut again*

Sherlock: Stop it, *terse command*
John: Jesus, I told you not to do that. One of these days I'm going to--
Sherlock: How can I be certain that my letter will be received well?
John: Give me your arm. *John injected a bit of bark into it* Your arm.
Sherlock: *sulkily thrust out his arm*
John: There's no magic formula. Or scientific formula, whatever. All you can do is be sincere.

Sherlock: Has anyone ever written you a love letter?
John: One or two. I don't know that you'd call them proper love letters. More like love notes. I like you, do you like me, that sort of thing.
Sherlock: Did you like them? The notes.
John: Everyone likes getting love letters. Everyone likes knowing that they're loved. It's flattering.

John: I'm going back to sleep now. Don't wake me unless it's a matter of life or death.
Sherlock: *gets up off the bed and then his bedroom door shut behind him*

John: Was this what it was like, then, Sherlock in love? *closes his eyes and wonders who it was*"
3,187762,Sherlock,John,"Sherlock: You like it? *Sherlock took the seat across from John, much as he had a week ago, when he'd taken notes on how to write a love letter. He looked very composed for someone who'd just confessed his feelings via expensive stationery, although his fingers were restless.*
John: Everyone likes love letters.
Sherlock: Yes, but. *Sherlock took a quick swallow of his own tea, surely burning himself in the process.* What about this one?
John: I like it, said John. I like it very much. *And then, Come over here, you--you--I can't believe-- He all but dragged Sherlock over the table to kiss him, and finally they both shuffled to the side in order to avoid upsetting any chairs or cups of tea. Sherlock was an awkward, clumsy kisser, who obviously had no idea what to do with his hands, but John just kept kissing and kissing him anyway, one hand fisted in his shirt and the other bending Sherlock's head towards him. When he finally stopped, it was to say, Why didn't you say something?*
Sherlock: I did, said Sherlock, dazed and baffled, with his hair even more ruffled than usual; it was a good look on him. I wrote you a letter and everything.
John: That wasn't-- John thudded his forehead against Sherlock's collarbone and fought to keep down a hysterical giggle. People don't normally ask the object of affection for advice on their own love letter.
Sherlock: Well, there wasn't anyone else to ask. Sherlock, at least, seemed to know how to hug; his arms were very comfortable around John's shoulders. And why shouldn't they? Surely the object of affection would know what they like.
John: Christ, said John. I thought you were writing that letter for someone else.
Sherlock: Sherlock sounded genuinely curious. But who else would there be?
John: John couldn't resist giggling that time, and after a moment, Sherlock joined him."
