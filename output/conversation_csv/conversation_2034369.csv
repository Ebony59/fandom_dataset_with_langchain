0,2034369,Harry,Dumbledore,"Harry: Enter.
Hermione: My Lord, we have him.
Harry: Bring him here...
Harry: Dumbledore.
Harry: Why don't you have a seat? You've been hiding long enough that I doubt you've enjoyed a comfortable sofa with a warm fire for a while."
1,2034369,Harry,Dumbledore,"Harry: I will admit I’m impressed. I expected you to last a year, maybe two. Though I have to admit some disappointment now. No last attempts at converting me? No ‘Harry, my boy’? No pleas for the Greater Good? No? No response? Oh well. Funny, I would have thought you’d be wondering where you went wrong, or did you figure that out during your time hiding? I’ll be surprised if you actually did and got it right.
Dumbledore: Tell me then. Tell me where I went so wrong, as to turn such a sweet boy into the man who betrayed his friends and murdered innocents.
Harry: What friends? What innocents? If you refer to the youngest Weasley son, whom I shan’t honour by naming, I will take care to remind you that he betrayed me. His was never a true friendship - he was the Pettigrew of my generation, clutching the hem of my robes for the hope of some reflected limelight and all the while bemoaning that the light should fall on me first, despite never working for it to be otherwise. And then he had the gall to betray me. As for the innocents, the Ministry was hardly innocent. They had people like Umbridge in all the positions of power and influence.
Harry: You were good, I’ll give you that. Five years at Hogwarts and I trusted you. Your incompetence completely passed me by, right up until the death of Sirius. You do realise that was the turning point, don’t you? I could overlook Lord Voldemort controlling a teacher, using a school of children as a security device, failing to close the school when there was a basilisk loose with previous history of murder, allowing me to get attacked by Dementors, failing to notice your friend was being impersonated by a deranged Death Eater, allowing a 14 year old boy to enter a potentially fatal tournament that was intended for only adults, failing to give me any reasonable protection from the press or training to defend myself, allowing an illegal Dark object to be used on me by a professor, allowing another teacher whom you knew hated me to effectively mind-rape me in the name of training and allowing me to be abused by my relatives every summer, despite my pleas to stay anywhere else but Privet Drive,"
2,2034369,Harry,Hermione,"Harry: I, Hermione and my select elite learned advanced hand-to-hand and weapons combat. It took us several months of intensive training of course, but the goblins were strict and effective teachers and I learnt as much, if not more, defence with them as I did in 7 years at Hogwarts.
Hermione: Yes, the goblins were indeed strict and effective teachers. We learned a lot from them.
Weasley twins: We turned out to have more intelligence and loyalty than our younger brother and who had already investigated some of the Dark Arts as research for their products.
Harry: By the end of the summer after leaving Hogwarts, I was the trained fighter you carefully avoided making me, independent, hardened and ruthless thanks to the goblins’ training and the loss of Sirius, and capable of fighting in unexpected ways both with and without my wand.
Harry: After all, who would expect and defend against the Golden Boy knowing the Dark Spells that can be found in a library as Dark as the Blacks? And what self-respecting (read: lazy) pureblood does anything, like fighting, with his hands instead of his wand? I was completely unexpected - by Voldemort, the Ministry and you.
Harry: From there, it was a simple matter to destroy all his Horcruxes except Nagini, lure Voldemort into an open fight, give the Goblin Nation the honour they deserved by having them kill Nagini with the Sword stolen from them by another wizard, and defeat Voldemort with a nifty spell found in the Black library that imitates Expelliarmus in appearance and incantation but instead of summoning the wand, plunges it into the opponent’s chest. Voldemort, being a lazy, arrogant shit, only bothered to put up a shield that defended against Light curses, and was defeated conclusively within 20 seconds of the duel being.
Harry: And that was when the trouble began - because you, after carefully raising me to kill the Dark Lord, then denounced me as a Dark murderer myself, and Ron, the back-stabbing bastard he is, presented evidence that supported your accusation.
Harry: So, seeing your intentions, and having previously experienced the Ministry’s fickleness when it came to power, Dark Lords and the Boy-Who-Lived, I stormed the Ministry. After all, I had just defeated Voldemort and saved the Wizarding World, I had as much support as I ever would and you were about to send me to Azkaban.
Harry: It would have been bloodless, except the fools, who’d never raised so much as a finger during Voldemort’s reign of terror, decided now was the time to fight back. I don't regret those deaths. I regard it as a natural improvement of the gene pool as the genes for stupidity were reduced somewhat.
Dumbledore: *shivers*"
