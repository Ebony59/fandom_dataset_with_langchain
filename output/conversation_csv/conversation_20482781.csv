0,20482781,Charlie,Mum,"Charlie: I want to talk to you, *I thought it was the best way.*
Charlie: This means that, no Mum, you won’t be having an in-law anytime soon. Children may be a possibility but, from where I am now in my life, children seem out of the question.
Charlie: I’m still the same old Charlie, the Charlie who used to bring in animals from outside and never take off his muddy shoes in the house. The only difference is now you know something more about me. And I can now be more me than I’ve ever been before!
Charlie: Right, I should give that time to sink in now. I’ll write soon and please enjoy the picture I attached of me with a new baby dragon! I’ve named her Molly! All my love, Charlie

Percy: Objectively, now I know, it seems quite clear now he’s, erm, come out, *He pushed his glasses up and scratched his unruly head of hair.* I mean, he was far more interested in dragons than relationships in Hogwarts, almost to an extreme level, *He cleared his throat and carried on eating his breakfast*
Ginny: I don’t mind who he does or doesn’t love, it’s not my business, all that love stuff is soppy anyway!
Molly: He’s cool any which way, men, women or no one, *She raised her tea in a toast.* Marriage or no marriage, children or no children
Ron: *Ron knew that she would accept Charlie no matter what. But she’d always hoped to be a grandmother and now that both Bill and Charlie seemed to be loving the bachelor life, her dream seemed to be getting further and further away.*
Fred: I did some research into when the words Asexual and Aromantic were coined but take my info with a pinch of salt. Hope you liked this and it only gets less-hetero from here!
Fred: It’s been a long time, hasn’t it? *Someone murmured, their voice wavering as they seemingly sat close to unconscious man.* The Healer said that most coma patients would have woken up by now,"
1,20482781,Fred,Molly,"Fred: “He’ll come around, Mol. He’s always been quick to recover, but he took a big hit, he’ll probably just be resting and recovering.”
Fred: “Ergh, Am I awake?”
Molly: “Fred, only family are allowed in here-“
Lee: “Fred, you’re awake!”
Fred: “So, how…”"
2,20482781,Oliver,Percy,"Oliver: You doing alright? *slowly caressed Percy's middle, pulling him backwards slightly into a hug* He nuzzled into his neck, blowing raspberries to make him laugh lowly as Marcus entered the room.
Marcus: You seem tense, puella, *whispered the nickname, spoke in Latin, he frequently slipped in words of the language he had drilled into his head as a child* He kissed the freckles on his forehead, his nose, his cheeks and all of his face until Percy had no choice but to give in.
Percy: It's just, just that I don't feel like I've fully made up for all the years I've been away from them, my family, for, *With a deep sigh, Percy shuffled his way out of Oliver's embrace and began to pace around the room. He removed his glasses from his face and rubbed the bridge of his nose harshly before adding.* And I may or may not have not told them about us, *He stopped pacing for a moment, taking in the reactions from Marcus and Oliver.*
Oliver: May or may not? What do you mean may or may not?
Marcus: Do you mean that your family don't know you're in a relationship with two men and we're going to a party with most of your family and family friends together?
Percy: Well I mean- I mean- no, it never felt like the right time!
Oliver: Not the right time!
Marcus: Well, it's been a stressful few months, with Fred in a coma, Ron recovering from being on the run and almost all the wizarding world just being in a war, *With a kind smile he approached Percy, gently cradling his face as he continued.* We've all had other things on our mind, yeah?
Percy: Yeah, *Percy weakly smiled as he sank into the warm hands either side of his face. Yet, almost as soon as he'd lent into Marcus' endearing physical affection, he sprang up with a sense of alertness.* But I'll tell them tonight, obviously, I mean my whole family will be there so it cuts out having to come out to each individual family member,
Oliver: I suppose so, *He brushed out his plain, white shirt and adjusted the cuffs of his old, but classic, Gryffindor Cardigan that his mother had knitted him for Christmas one year.*
Oliver: Ready to go in? *squeezing one of Percy's hands as he said so.*
Percy: I guess,"
3,20482781,Percy,Ginny,"Percy: Ready to go in? *squeezing one of Percy's hands*
Oliver: I guess.
Molly: Percy! You're here!
Percy: Erm, can I have everyone's attention, please?
Percy: Well, not to steal Ginny's thunder but I have some news, important news that I should've told you all after the Battle of Hogwarts.
Percy: It's nothing life threatening, unless one of you takes this badly, then it might be.
Percy: Erm, well, what I'm trying to say is that I'm erm, I'm not straight.
Molly: Oh Percy, that's really brave of you, thank you for trusting us and I hope you know that we all... Accept you for who you are.
Arthur: We love you.
Percy: Well that's not it. I have something else to tell you.
Fred: I dread what your kids are going to be like, three obsessive guys raising a child.
George: Yeah, we're happy for you, mate."
4,20482781,Fleur,Bill,"Fleur: Zere, all done. *admired her work* You look fantastique!
Bill: *gazed at himself in the mirror* He did look fantastic.
Fleur: And a mystery guest.
Molly: Fleur who's your friend? *shocked face* She's very extravagant.
Bill: I am Champagne Sharpe, a friend of hers from Beauxbatons. *barely stopping himself from bursting out laughing* We've gotten closer since the war and she's showing around the parts of the country I wasn't allowed to see in my summers off from school."
5,20482781,Bill,Molly,"Bill: I want to talk to you, *barely stopping himself from bursting out laughing* We've gotten closer since the war and she's showing around the parts of the country I wasn't allowed to see in my summers off from school.
Molly: *cocked an eyebrow* Oh, I was wondering why you don't have a French accent?

Molly: *nodded* Still curious about the woman who was so close to her daughter-in-law.

Molly: This is Champagne Sharpe, a friend of Fleur's from Beauxbatons, *sniggers from his siblings who had seen him in drag before* Although we haven't of her before, but it seems Bill won't be coming, Ginny dear,
Ginny: *met Bill's eyes* Nice outfit, Champagne, *stopped just before the couple and looked Champagne up and down* We know it's you Bill,

Champagne: Bill? Who's Bill? *decided to embrace his full drag self* Oh, is that Fleur's husband?
Ginny: *confirmed this* Even if she knew it was Bill underneath, it didn't mean she couldn't play along.

George: Any siblings?
Champagne: My father is called Ale Sharpe, my mother is Sherri Sharpe and I have a sister named Brandie Sharpe,

Percy: Sharpe? I've never heard that name before?
Champagne: *wracked his brain hurriedly* It's a combination of two names, Shaun, from my father's family, and Harpe, from my mother's..."
6,20482781,Bill,Molly,"Bill: “Mu- Molly! Mol, can I tell you a secret?”
Molly: “Erm, Champagne, yes, I guess you can tell me a secret.”
Bill: “I’m actually Bill, Champagne is just a persona!” *whispering, giggling behind his hand*
Molly: “Bill? Really?” *looking him up and down* “At your sister’s birthday party?”
Bill: “What?”
Molly: “I mean, couldn’t you have waited until another date?” *confused* “All this silly dressing up at her coming of age party, the first big get together after the war!”
Bill: “Mum, don’t you see what this is all about?” *desperate* “It’s not just dressing up, this is a way I like to express myself!”
Molly: *shocked* “In women’s clothing?”
Bill: “Yes!” *stepping closer to her* “I mean there are plenty of straight drag queens out there but I love dressing like this because I get to express a side of myself that people overlook.”
Molly: *shocked again* *thinking* ‘Fuck. I haven’t come out to her yet!’
Bill: *closing his eyes* “I’m bisexual Mum.”
Molly: *silence* *eye contact* *reaching out and stroking his face* “If it makes you happy, then that’s all we’ve ever wanted.”"
7,20482781,Luna,Ginny,"Luna: Ginny! *settled on the grass, starting to plait the flowers into her girlfriend's hair*
Ginny: There, now you look like a goddess. *replied to the heartfelt look she was getting from her girlfriend*
Ginny: I don't know why you're so shocked. You already knew! *pointing towards most of her siblings*
Molly: How come your father and I didn't know, yet you trusted your siblings enough to tell them?
Ginny: I don't know, mum, I think I just feared your reaction. You're only girl, in a relationship with another woman, it's hard for some people.
Arthur: It's not hard for us, Gin, it's not hard for us. *pulled the three women into a hug*
Arthur: Your father's right, Ginny, we love you and only want you to be happy, okay?"
8,20482781,Molly,Arthur,"Molly: Arthur! Arthur! *called up the stairs between mumbles to herself* Goodness that man sometimes- Arthur!
Arthur: *appeared at the bottom of the stairs, holding a backpack full of various flags and paints* Ah good, you've got the bag!
Molly: *delighted* Now, you're all here aren't you?
Ron: Harry isn't, *with a badly disguised sad tone*
Molly: *sighed* Well we know why he's not here, *and continued with what she was previously going to say* We've brought you all here for a trip!
Bill: A trip? You couldn't have told us earlier than yesterday?
Arthur: *finally chipping in after silently struggling to strap his pack on* We wanted it to be a surprise.
Percy: Where are we going exactly?
Molly: You'll find out, now don't ask anymore questions, let's just take each other's hands and apparate to where we're going.
Arthur: *opened his backpack to drag out different neon flags and tossed palates of face paint and glitter to other people* This was all Arthur's idea, really, Molly said as Ginny, Luna, and Charlie all tackled her with hugs, leaving her breathless. We just wanted to show our support, for you and what has obviously been a big part of your life for so long now."
