0,20798489,Peter Parker,Flash Thompson,"Peter Parker: Hey, Flash, have you seen my backpack?
Flash Thompson: Why would I know where your backpack is, Penis Parker?
Peter Parker: Because you're always snooping around my stuff, Flash.
Flash Thompson: I'm not snooping, I'm just curious about how a loser like you manages to survive in this world.
Peter Parker: Well, unlike you, I have actual responsibilities and a secret identity to protect.
Flash Thompson: Oh please, like anyone would care about your secret identity. You're just a kid in a onesie.
Peter Parker: You'd be surprised, Flash. People have tried to expose me before, but I always manage to keep my identity hidden.
Flash Thompson: Yeah, yeah, whatever. Just find your stupid backpack and leave me alone.
Peter Parker: I will, once you stop being such a jerk.
Flash Thompson: I'll stop being a jerk when you stop being a loser.
Peter Parker: Deal."
1,20798489,Peter Parker,Spider-Man,"Peter: I, uh, there’s an attack downtown and I..?
Mr. Harrington: Go. I’ll cover for you.
Peter: Please tell Ms. Warren I’m sorry about missing her test next period and that I promise I’ll—
Mr. Harrington: Peter, I’ll handle the academics. You go save the world.

Peter: For Peter Parker, normal has always been a relative term.
Peter: After the bus and the gym and the general mess of a hostage situation, Peter’s new normal is Spider-Man watch parties with added commentary from his decathlon team.
Peter: It’s Flash Thompson apologizing in the hallways and disappearing whenever Peter tries to talk to him.
Peter: It’s watching Spider-Man Fails compilations and Buzzfeed: Unsolved on the couch of the Avengers Compound while the actual Avengers mingle about their daily lives with the added benefit of an entire team of teenagers and one Mr. Harrington crashing at their place.
Peter: It’s a group of ordinary teenagers and their superhero friend trying to get through high school in addition to hiding one of the biggest secrets in their lives from just about everyone.

MJ: Abe rung first.
Sally: I hope you actually know the answer to this.
Abe: Of course I do."
2,20798489,MJ,Abe,"MJ: Abe rung first, *MJ says.*
Sally: I hope you actually know the answer to this.
Abe: Of course I do. The answer is Ruthenium.
MJ: *looks down at her cards* Wrong.
Abe: Are you kidding me? I studied my ass off. I’m pretty sure it’s Ruthenium.
MJ: Cindy, Charles? Want to steal?
Cindy: It’s Rutherfordium.
Abe: *looks down at his hands with a face full of dread, buries his face in his arms, and whispers a quiet fuck.*
Mr. Harrington: Language, please.
Sally: Alright, I give. Someone switch with me ‘cause I need a break.
Mr. Stark: Personally, I’m rather fond of Badassium but that’s a PR nightmare that Pepper still won’t talk to me about. Alright, I have the cards. MJ, you’re up.
MJ: *passes the cards to Mr. Stark on her way up to the table* Don’t skip cards again.
Mr. Stark: It mixes them up. Prevents you from memorizing order.
MJ: It’s a pain in the ass when I have to sort them again.
Betty: Got it, Cap’n.
Peter: *gives her a two fingered wave and makes exactly zero effort to get up from his spot.*"
3,20798489,Flash,Abe,"Sally: I thought Flash was on deck for Abe. He usually is.
Mr. Harrington: Flash had something come up. He won't be here today.
Sally: But he's supposed to be here, right? He's been skipping as much as Peter, lately.
Peter: I should be vaguely offended by this considering everyone here knows very well why I skip in the first place.
Betty: He said he'd be here next week.
Cindy: Awfully convenient that Flash misses the third Avengers' practice for the third time in a row.
Charles: He's just avoiding it 'cause Peter's Spider-Man and he feels weird about being an asshole to his hero for, like, years.
Peter: The exposed feeling of someone casually mentioning my alter-ego isn't new, exactly, but having a group of people other than the Avengers know my identity is more than a little uncomfortable.
Peter: Revealing my identity to the Avengers had been easy... Plus, it had been Mr. Stark who found and introduced them in the first place.
Peter: Revealing my identity to the team? Much harder... His decathlon team, while full of amazingly smart and bright people, are just normal kids.
Peter: Over the past four weeks, things have changed... They're getting a little bit closer, a little more comfortable."
4,20798489,Mr. Harrington,Peter,"Mr. Harrington: Mr. Harrington assures Peter, later, that he’s trying everything in his power to throw them off. Not even he would do anything to risk Peter’s secret.
Peter: It’s a big change for all of them; going from nerd group to secret superhero support group all because of a squid-like dude with a rocket launcher and two cronies who were looking for a quick buck and didn’t mind holding a group of high-school kids hostage. Peter goes from making sure absolutely no one in school is suspicious to oh my god please stop making the Spider-Man hand when I’m around because someone is definitely going to notice at least twice a day. The little tidbit about Flash doesn’t help either because Peter knows that Flash loves (loved?) Spider-Man. It’s not like he’s unaware of it—the fact that Flash was consistently an asshole to Peter but waxed poetry about Spider-Man had been the punchline of several shared jokes between him and Ned—but Flash apologized weeks ago and Peter had thought they were finally on the way to some sort of truce. Apparently not, if Flash is avoiding him. Peter’s smart enough to realize that there’s probably a little more to this situation than he realizes. With a little determination, he thinks that he might be able to mend something there. He’s no sherlock, but he’s pretty damn good at getting to the bottom of things. It comes with being a vigilante, fighting crime and all of that interesting stuff.
Mr. Harrington: “Lay off your teammate, please,” Mr. Harrington calls. Charles snorts but covers it with a cough and doesn’t say anything else. “Especially if he is not here to defend himself.”
Cindy: “If Thor shows up while we practice and Flash misses it I’m rubbing it in his face for the rest of his life.”
Peter: Which is, admittedly, fair. Whenever Thor shows up at the compound, Peter feels like rubbing it in a bit too. It’s not his fault that Thor, god of Thunder and of any hairstyle he pleases, is just so cool. Even Mr. Stark has finally let up on Thor being Peter’s favorite Avenger, because, really, who else would it be? Mr. Harrington apparently thinks something similar because he only shakes his head and lets the subject drop. The rest of the practice, despite some rocky answers and general teenage bullshit, goes rather smoothly and without further mention of Peter’s current number one problem that is Flash Thompson.
Peter: Long after his decathlon team leaves for the weekend, Peter is left with cleaning up the large mess they made in the common area. It’s fine with him, truthfully, as it gives him something to do with his hands. Plus it’s another way he’s found that he can say thank you for not telling the entire world that I, Peter Parker, am Spider-Man without actually having to say words to his teammates. He’s tried, in the past, to express his gratitude verbally on multiple occasions. MJ punched him for being an idiot. Abe said he’d do the same for any of them so it’s no big deal, really.
Peter: Peter folds the makeshift table, cleans up the wrappers and throws them in the trash. He takes the multitude of decathlon cards, stacks them and stores them underneath the coffee table for next time. By the time he finishes making the place spotless once again, it’s almost ten at night and there’s absolutely no one around the common area.
Peter: He’s not exactly sure what comes over him at that point; one moment he’s fine and the next there’s a suffocating feeling in his chest and it feels hard to breathe. His hands shake and he tries to chase away the feeling of helplessness in his mind. He feels his gut churn and his vision dance and he knows what’s happening—panic attacks are nothing new—but that doesn’t stop the annoyance in the back of his mind.
Peter: Fuck, Peter whispers because he does not have time to deal with random trauma induced bullshit when absolutely none of his triggers are here. This is awful. Peter hates it. He wants a refund, please. Peter?
Tony Stark: Of course Mr. Stark that chooses that exact moment to enter the room. It’s always Mr. Stark."
5,20798489,Peter,Mr. Stark,"Peter: Fuck, *whispers* Peter?
Mr. Stark: Of course Mr. Stark that chooses that exact moment to enter the room. It’s always Mr. Stark. It’s like he has a built-in radar for when Peter’s suffering from panic attacks in the dead of night with absolutely no trigger in sight, seriously what the fuck, brain.
Peter: *gives him the one moment gesture with his hands* Please no more are-you-okay talks.
Mr. Stark: Maybe if you actually talked to someone else about this then I wouldn’t have to.
Peter: I talk to Sam, *protests* I talk to my team too.
Mr. Stark: You make jokes with your team as you all silently suffer under the weight of your shared trauma, *corrects* Sam is good though. Keep talking to him.
Peter: I hate this.
Mr. Stark: Don’t we all.
Peter: I’m Spider-Man, *says* I should be, I dunno, out saving people right now. I should be—I should be doing something. Not sitting around ‘cause I had a panic attack.
Mr. Stark: Peter— *catches Peter before he can go on another verbal barf* Nuh, uh. Listen for a sec before you start blaming yourself again. I’ve been through a lot of bullshit, kiddo. I can’t sleep, sometimes. Too many thoughts in my head so I’m usually in the lab. It’s hard to close my eyes sometimes. Cap doesn’t sleep well either. He usually takes it out on the punching bags in the training room. Clint wanders the halls, Nat avoids people. Wanda stays holed up in her room. Bruce stays in his lab.
Peter: *pauses* Just because you’re a superhero, *says* And just because you think you have a responsibility to be fine doesn’t mean you are. That’s okay. It’s okay not to be okay, kid. You don’t have to keep pushing yourself to be something you’re not.
Peter: It’s hard, *admits* It feels like I have to be, for everyone else ‘cause they keep looking at me when this kinda stuff goes on.
Mr. Stark: You and your team went through the ringer, Underoos, *says* It sucks. A bona fide disaster of a situation but you don’t have to be the..."
6,20798489,Peter,Mr. Stark,"Peter: It feels like I have to be, for everyone else 'cause they keep looking at me when this kinda stuff goes on.
Mr. Stark: You and your team went through the ringer, Underoos. It sucks. A bona fide disaster of a situation but you don’t have to be the pillar of support for all of them. You’re going to run yourself into the ground doing that. Instead, help where you can and let time and professionals do the rest. It’ll take a while, but eventually things are going to start to change. The world continues. It doesn’t always get better, but we move on.
Peter: Thanks, Mr. Stark.
Mr. Stark: Go to bed, kid. You look dead on your feet.
Peter: Night, Mr. Stark.

Cindy: hey guys check out this awesome video i made [spiderman-swinging-into-buildings.mov]
Peter: Cindy why do you hate me?
Cindy: i don’t hate you
Cindy: also it has 100k views on youtube
Charles: congrats on being youtube famous :)
Cindy: thanks charles i knew i could count on you for support :)
Abe: its good thing i don’t know spiderman personally or anything. wouldnt that would be embarrassing
Cindy: right?
Michelle: its pretty embarrassing
Ned: yeah dude being spiderman would suck right about now
Peter: guys please i dont deserve this

Ned: I want to let everyone know that I am Spider-Man’s go-to Guy in the Chair and you will all have to pry that from my cold dead hands.
MJ: Does anyone have anything actually productive to add?
Sally: If Ned is Peter’s Guy in the Chair then what does that make us? We need a title or something.
Charles: Teenage mutant ninja support group. Teenage mutant spider support group?"
7,20798489,Abe,Peter,"Abe: Peter! Hey, wait—shit, you walk fast.
Peter: What’s up?
Abe: Could you check on Cindy for me? We figured, y’know, it’s been a while so we were going to try gym again together but she just—it wasn’t a good day, I guess. I tried, but I can’t find her and I’ve been running around the school looking for her. You know how she gets about gym and I’m, I’m just worried, man.
Peter: I’ll find her. Tell Coach Wilson I’m sick?
Abe: Thank you. I can go get Mr. Harrington so he can cover for you."
8,20798489,Peter,Cindy Moon,"Peter: I want to talk to you. *walks towards Cindy Moon* It's urgent.
Cindy Moon: Hi, Peter. Did Abe set you up to this?
Peter: Abe's just worried. He's not the only one.
Cindy Moon: I really did want to try. Everyone else has been trying but I haven't been to gym once. Still can't look at a bus. I thought about switching school for a while I couldn't just...leave, I guess. It's stupid.
Peter: It's not stupid.
Cindy Moon: It is, though. Can't..."
9,20798489,Cindy,Peter,"Cindy: I want to talk to you, she says eventually. Everyone else has been trying but I haven’t been to gym once. Still can’t look at a bus. I thought about switching school for a while I couldn’t just…leave, I guess. It’s stupid.”
Peter: It’s not stupid, Peter says immediately.
Cindy: It is, though, she shakes her head, Can’t get on a bus, can’t look at pictures of guns, can’t go to gym class. Everyone else can do those things and not think twice about them.
Peter: But you’re not everyone else.
Cindy: But I’m not everyone else, Cindy agrees. And that’s the problem.
Peter: Cindy, Peter tries. What happened was sucky. Like, truthfully, terrible. It’s something that will never happen to most people. You’re not them. They didn’t have their bus explode when they were supposed to be going on a really cool field trip, but you did. They didn’t get held hostage by the three scrooges, you did. They didn’t throw a bunch of gym trash at Squidward to save me from getting a rocket launcher to the face—that’s all you. Which was pretty awesome, by the way. I still owe you for that.
Cindy: Cindy huffs out a laugh. He can tell she doesn’t quite believe him, but she relents anyways. The redness in her eyes is already fading so it’s marginally harder to tell that she had a breakdown behind the school staircase. It was pretty cool, She sighs and leans back up against the wall. There’s the tiniest smile on her face when she says, You’re really good at this stuff, y’know, Peter?
Peter: He blinks, confused, Good at what?
Cindy: She waves her arms around sporadically, Dealing with all of this. Being a superhero. Hiding you identity. I never would’ve known if that shit hadn’t gone down. If I were you, I’d be constantly worried, I guess. Freaked out. I would’ve slipped up and quit at the beginning. But you still go out every night just to save others when I can’t even walk down to the gym without having a panic attack, she shrugs. You’re good at it.
Peter: Peter thinks, privately, of his latest panic attack in the Avengers’ common room. He thinks of every time he’s closed his eyes only to see the vulture, or a plane crashing, or a building falling. How often he’s woken up with Uncle Ben’s face in his mind and the feeling of blood on his hands. I’m not, really, he says in lieu of trying to explain. She obviously doesn’t believe him but he can’t find the words to say that his brain function is actually pretty awful too. Instead, he pushes himself off of the cold ground and offers her a hand. You want to go to the library?
Cindy: Cindy hesitates for a second, but takes his hand so he can pull her up from the floor. I guess it’s better than the gym.
Peter: It’s better than the gym, Peter agrees."
10,20798489,Charles,Peter,"Charles: Hey, *waves them over*
Peter: I thought you had chem?
Charles: We have a term paper due in a couple of weeks and since she’s giving us class time to work on it, I asked if I could go to the library to look for references, *gestures to the hoard of chemistry books littered around the floor and makes a face* What about you two?
Cindy: Gym.
Peter: Mind if we stay here?
Charles: Of course. I don’t mind harboring hall pass fugitives. I’ll give you a warning if I see a teacher coming.
Cindy: Thanks.
...
Charles: This sucks.
Peter: Hey, it’s cool, don’t sweat it.
Cindy: You’re doing better than I am, Charles. I haven’t even managed to walk towards the gym. You’re still in gym practice.
Peter: It’s embarrassing, kinda. Because Peter goes through this bullshit every night and it doesn’t stop him. Spider-Man always gets back on his feet. I can’t handle it once, right? I get panic attacks that are bad enough that I have to go skip class. That’s humiliating.
Peter: I have panic attacks too.
Charles: You do?
Peter: Yeah. It’s hard to avoid. They don’t ever really go away, you just get better at hiding them.
Charles: Damn.
Cindy: You know you can come to us too, right, Peter? If you’re ever feeling like a..."
11,20798489,Cindy,Peter,"Cindy: I always thought... Never mind. You know you can come to us too, right, Peter? If you're ever feeling like a steaming pile of garbage?
Peter: I always feel like that. Thanks, though.
Cindy: I mean it.
Peter: I know. And I mean it too when I say thank you.







[sally]: should we let the avengers fanclub know we know the avengers
[ned]: yes
[cindy]: please do it
[peter]: no
[michelle]: absolutely not
[sally]: oh my god please let me just release one picture of hawkeye anonymously to the fan club. please
[michelle]: absolutely. not."
12,20798489,Peter,Natasha,"Peter: You guys really didn’t have to come. Not that I don’t appreciate you guys come out here— I do! I really do, but it’s just some dumb decathlon competition. I’m sure you had Avengers stuff to do.
Natasha: We wanted to. You and your team don’t get to spend hours on our couch and expect us not to be a little invested.
Ned: Oh my god is that Black Widow?!
Natasha: *puts a finger to her lips*
Ned: I’m so sorry Ms. Black Widow ma’am, it’s such an honor.
Peter: *wants to mention that Ned sees them every other week and has, in fact, met her before*
Sally: You guys came!
Mr. Stark: What, like we’d miss it?
Mr. Rogers: Congratulations.
Mr. Harrington: *thanks the Avengers for coming because it really means a lot of the kids, you see, so we very much appreciate your continued support*
Flash: *sitting on the steps of the stage, far away from the crowd and mostly in the shadows. His shoulders are hunched, hands twisting in his lap. His back is turned. He’s on his phone but not really looking at it. Every once in a while, he’ll scan the room like he’s waiting for someone to show up.*"
13,20798489,Peter,Flash,"Peter: You're not going to leave, right?
Flash: Not unless you want me to.
Peter: I should expect it by now. My parents. They've never shown up before. It's just some stupid competition. I'm used to it.
Peter: It doesn't make it right.
Flash: Why are you here, Parker?
Peter: No offense, but you kind of look like shit.
Flash: Is this some superhero requirement? Trying to cheer up people when they're being pathetic?
Peter: You're not being pathetic, Flash. And I wouldn't know, I've never read the superhero manual.
Peter: You want to come to the compound with me tonight?
Flash: ...Why would you offer that?
Peter: Since you're not an alternate anymore, I dunno, I figured we could practice together? If you wanted, of course. That way you can show your parents up when we win nationals and you answer the winning question.
Flash: Oh.
Peter: Is that a yes?
Flash: It's... I mean, I just don't understand why me? I was—I was awful to you. I said a lot of shit, did a lot of shit."
14,20798489,Flash,Peter,"Flash: I mean, I just don’t understand why me? I was—I was awful to you. I said a lot of shit, did a lot of shit and you still saved my life, man. I don't even know why you're talking to me right now.
Peter: You’re working on getting better. Don’t think I haven’t noticed. You told everyone else to back off of me. You haven’t thrown spitballs at all in calculus. Haven’t said anything awful since the gym. You even let me borrow a pencil last period.
Flash: I’m not being awful to you because I found out you are Spider-Man.
Peter: You’re not being awful to me because you realized you were wrong. I don’t care how that happened.
Peter: Then make it better. *stands up and offers his hand to Flash*
Flash: Sure, Parker."
15,20798489,Sally,Peter,"Sally: Peter’s uh—he’s uh… *Sally grabs his arm and yanks him away* Really? ‘He’s taking a huge dump in the bathroom or something’? That’s what you come up with?
Flash: What do you want from me, Sally? *hisses right back* You want me to tell everyone that Peter Parker is Spider-Man instead?
Ms. Warren: Have any of you seen Peter? *asks* Ms. Vern just messaged me about him suddenly leaving class.
Mr. Harrington: I just sent Peter to get me some supplies. He should be back soon.
bad night?
bad night.
Peter: Oh no, *says as he watches Iron Man get blasted into a building through the livestream.*
Sally: Hey, this looks kinda bad, *discreetly shoving her phone in his hands* You think he’s going to show up?
Peter: Spider-Man always shows up, *tells her before raising his hand* Ms. Vern, I just remembered that we have a problem with decathlon and Mr. Harrington needs my assistance like right now, can I please leave early if I turn in my sheet?
Ms. Vern: Let me verify this with Mr. Harrington first.
Peter: No time! I gotta go, *goes tearing out the door before Ms. Vern can catch him.*
Class Gossip: Ms. Jones, Ms. Avril, please go get Mr. Parker and tell him we need to discuss this before he up and leaves again."
16,20798489,Avril,Mr. Parker,"Avril: Avril, please go get Mr. Parker and tell him we need to discuss this before he up and leaves again.
Peter: That’s super neat and all but Peter doesn’t have time to wait up for them. He rushes inside the nearest bathroom, checking to make sure there’s no one there, before he starts yanking off his clothes. He doesn’t bother with a stall, too much in a hurry to really care.
Mr. Harrington: I, uh, there’s an attack downtown and I..?
Peter: Go, Mr. Harrington says with all the exasperation of teaching a high school vigilante and, in turn, breaking just about every single school rule there ever is. I’ll cover for you.
Peter: Please tell Ms. Warren I’m sorry about missing her test next period and that I promise I’ll—
Mr. Harrington: Peter, Mr. Harrington says. I’ll handle the academics. You go save the world.
Peter: Thank you, Mr. Harrington, sir. I won’t let you down.
Mr. Harrington: I would hope not considering New York rests on your shoulders, now, Mr. Harrington says and there’s a smile on his face. He gestures for Peter to follow him. Let’s get you out of here without being seen.
Peter: So much easier.
Peter: Hey, uh, Flash? Peter says and knocks on the door. Not to assume but I thought we were past this.
Flash: *shushes him and leans against the door.*
Flash: He’s taking a huge dump in the bathroom or something, Flash blurts out. Ms. Warren stares at him.
Sally: Really? ‘He’s taking a huge dump in the bathroom or something’? That’s what you come up with?
Flash: What do you want from me, Sally? Flash hisses right back. You want me to tell everyone that Peter Parker is Spider-Man instead?"
17,20798489,MJ,Peter Parker,"MJ: *grabs his arm and yanks him away* Really? 'He's taking a huge dump in the bathroom or something'? That's what you come up with?
Flash: What do you want from me, Sally? You want me to tell everyone that Peter Parker is Spider-Man instead?
Mr. Harrington: I just sent Peter to get me some supplies. He should be back soon.
Ms. Warren: Principal Morita is shutting down the school soon due to the villain attack in Manhattan. I want to make sure that all students are accounted for before that happened.
Mr. Harrington: Of course. I was just about to send Michelle to find him. *sends her a pointed look*
Ms. Warren: *looks at him, shrugs and wanders down the walls, dragging Sally and Flash along behind her*
Mr. Harrington: *meets Ms. Warren's eyes and lies through his teeth* I'll personally make sure they find him and get him safely to class.
Ms. Warren: *thanks him and continues down the hall*
Peter: *has never been more thankful to Mr. Harrington in his life*

Flash: Yeah.
Cindy: Is Peter alive?
Charles: I don't know, he hasn't posted anything but also you know him.
Betty: Peter?
Abe: Hello? Peter?
Cindy: Hewwwo!!! Pweter!!!
Peter: If you make me read that one more time I actually will die.
Abe: He lives.
Peter: It's 6:30, I have 30 more minutes before I have to get up guys, please let me sleep.
Charles: Sorry not all of us can swing to school when we are L...

But why?"
19,20798489,peter,ned,"betty: anything but also u know him
abe: peter?
cindy: hello? peter?
peter: if u make me read that one more time i actually will die
abe: he lives
peter: its 6:30 i have 30 more minutes before i have to get up guys please let me sleep
charles: SORRY not all of us can SWING to SCHOOL when we are LATE
charles: some us have to BIKE our dumb asses ALL THE WAY to midtown

sally: spiderman who? i only know big tire charles
flash: *spider-man
sally: shut
ned: fr fr peter u ok? last night looked bad man
peter: its fine i was only stabbed like, once,
abe: congratulations that’s almost an improvement
flash: is he serious? i cant tell if hes serious
cindy: peter if u come to school with a stab wound im going to stab you myself
michelle: hey everyone reminder that we have decathlon this afternoon and if you miss it im hunting you down for sport
ned: mj peter may or may not have gotten stabbed
michelle: and?
charles: savage

Peter: So the thing is, Peter does, in fact, have a stab wound. He hides it pretty well from most everyone but he can feel Ned’s judging stare when he winces sitting down at lunch. Flash passes him a note in calc that’s a poorly drawn spider and are you ok? written underneath. The rest of his team definitely knows someone is up and Peter dreads decathlon that afternoon more than anything. His team is very observant. Unfortunately, they also very much like the worry.
“Let us"
20,20798489,Charles,Peter,"Charles: We aren’t going to let you bleed out in an alley. Second rule is that if you feel like you need to leave, for whatever reason, tell us and we’ll get you out. Third rule is stop shutting us out. It’s not healthy. We understand this is dangerous business—we were there, remember?—but you’ve helped all of us so much, Peter, we just want to help you.
Flash: Let us help.
Betty: You’re our friend. Sometimes.
Betty: Fourth rule is we get free Spider-Man merch for being awesome.
Betty: Fifth rule is let us know if you ever need the, uh, the teenage mutant spider support group instead of the decathlon support group.
Peter: Okay, okay. I agree. Thank you all for the mushy feelings and letting me know you guys care but don’t we have decathlon to get to?
MJ: Tell us if you need a break, okay?
Peter: I’m not heartless, Peter. Even though you shouldn't have gotten stabbed in the first place.
Peter: I did not want to get stabbed in the first place. He does not tell her this."
