0,2081859,Bucky,Steve,"Bucky: Your soulmark doesn't have fingerprints.
Steve: What?
Bucky: Your soulmark doesn't have fingerprints. It's. It's not. It doesn't.
Steve: I don't have a soulmark. I've never had one.
Bucky: But it's... It's there. A real one. Like--not like mine.
Steve: What do you mean, not like yours?
Bucky: Not. Not fake."
1,2081859,Bucky,Steve,"Bucky: But it's . . . *gestures uncomfortably to the back of his own neck* It's there. A real one. Like--not like mine.
Steve: . . . what do you mean, not like yours? *sets aside the toothpaste*
Bucky: Not. Not fake, *grips the collar of his shirt instead of reaching back to touch his mark* HYDRA gave me a fake one. Yours. It isn't.
Steve: Bucky, *strangled and hurting* Buck, no, you--that's your soulmark. You always had it. Everybody--everybody at school was always real jealous, 'cause yours was so big and bright and flashy.
Bucky: But I don't have a soulmate, *tense and visibly uncomfortable*
Steve: You--you do, *because Bucky must, if it hasn't scarred over* Some old, lonely man in a home somewhere who never got the soulmate he waited probably twenty years and then another lifetime for, who never even got the miserable closure of a scar in wartime, but . . . but Bucky has a soulmate. The chances of finding him before he dies are not even worth thinking about, especially finding him with Bucky in a condition to meet him and confirm, and Steve feels sick as he thinks about that. He resented that man so much when he was a kid, resented the stranger he'd never met who was going to come and take Bucky away from him, when really it was going to be the other way around all along. Bucky should've come home from the war and met his soulmate and married him and had a whole life with him while Steve slept in the ice. Maybe he'd have lived long enough to welcome Steve into the new world with an old man's smirk, but he shouldn't have had to suffer through HYDRA and lose all chance of the life the mark on his neck promised to get here. It's not . . . that isn't what should've happened.
Bucky: I don't, *insists, tense and visibly uncomfortable* I remember, I--before, I remember. I told you I didn't, before. And you . . . and you let me kiss you.
Steve: *chokes a little, struggles for words* You told me you didn't want him, *still hating himself for every word of it* Not that he wasn't there.
Bucky: No, *repeats uneasily, shaking his head* I don't have a soulmate. It'd be--it'd be you, if I had one. And it's not. So I don't.
Steve: *does not have an answer for that* Bucky should hate him. Bucky should be grieving and furious. He should not be telling him that he doesn't care about the man he was supposed to live and die for.
Bucky: It makes me angry, *his eyes flicking down to look at Steve's neck, although his voice is flat and toneless and doesn't sound angry at all* That should be my hand.
Steve: *opens his mouth to tell him--something, but then out of the corner of his eye he glimpses the back of his own neck in the mirror, and . . .* What the hell, *he says in disbelief, because there is something there, and when he jerks the left door of the mirrored medicine cabinet forward just so, he can see the reflection of it in the right* There's a handprint on my neck. A pale, pale handprint, barely any lighter than my skin, barely showing at all even under direct light, but still there. And Bucky's right: it doesn't"
2,2081859,asset,man,"The asset: I want to talk to you, he says. That means I get to pick who I belong to now. I'm not his asset, I'm yours.
The man: You're his soulmate, the man says, voice strangled.
The asset: No, he insists, letting go of his collar to strip his shirt off completely and throwing it aside as he rummages for a knife. Not anyone's anything, if it's not you.
The man: Bucky, don't! the man blurts, horrified again.
The asset: No, the asset says, staring up at him blankly. That's what other people said. Not what I said.
The asset: Who's better than me? the asset demands, and the man balks.
The man: What? he asks, expression disbelieving.
The asset: On your neck! the asset snaps, gesturing sharply with the knife. You promised me until the end! But there's someone on your neck!
The man: That's not... The man cringes, reaching back to touch the mark.
The asset: That is, he says, because he is just an asset, he understands that. But he still gets to choose.
The asset: I don't care, the asset says again.
The asset: Keep me until the hand on your neck comes for you and then decommission me. Or don't. Put me at the foot of the bed. Put me in the basement or a cell and bring me out when you need me. I don't care. I can still be a valuable asset. I will shape history for you.
The man: Bucky, the man says hoarsely, grabbing the asset's hand and turning it over in his own."
3,2081859,The asset,The man,"The asset: That’s not true. That’s not even close to true. You pulled me outta more scrapes than anybody else, in and out of the war. You never hurt me.
The man: This hand did!
The asset: Bucky.
The man: It ain’t right. Oughta been Carter or Wilson or Romanov, somebody who could fuckin’ touch you. Oughta been Barnes. Barnes coulda touched you.
The man: You let Barnes kiss you.
The asset: I am not nice.
The man: I never liked you for being nice. I liked you because I knew there wasn’t a damn disaster I could get into that you wouldn’t have my six. And your habit of shooting people before they shot me, I’ll admit I was pretty attached to that one.
The asset: Are you trying to make me laugh?
The man: Come here.
The asset: . . . I thought it would be red.
The man: It’s not?
The asset: Black."
4,2081859,The asset,The man,"The asset: It’s not? *staring at the man's face* Black. It’s black.
The asset: Touch mine. *begging unthinkingly, tightening his grip on the back of the man's neck*
The man: It won’t respond, Buck. *quietly* I told you--you always had the same mark. Wasn’t me.
The asset: But you didn’t have this. *shaking his head in frustration, tightening his grip on the back of the man's neck* Before I had this hand you didn’t have a mark at all.
The man: That doesn’t change your mark.
The asset: Barnes isn’t your soulmate. *voice rough* It’s me. I am.
The asset: I ain’t! *snapping* An’ I don’t wanna be, ‘cause Barnes wasn’t your asset. I mean--your--
The man: My soulmate.
The asset: There wasn’t a Winter Soldier when you were born. No hand to make the mark, back then. *rough edge coming in harder in his voice* But from the damn second you were conceived, there was always a Captain America.
The man: That’s not . . . that’s not how it works.
The asset: Touch me. *leaning in and tipping his head meaningfully* Your soul already did it. This is just proving it."
