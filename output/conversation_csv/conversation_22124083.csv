0,22124083,Hermione,Lavender,"Lavender: Does it not bother you? Never hanging out around other girls?
Hermione: What would they have to speak with her about?
Hermione: They weren’t there when she was eleven and terrified, hands sticky with Ron’s blood. Weren’t there when she was twelve and dreaming of gold eyes for months. Grappling with her own mortality, wondering if this is how it had started for Riddle. Weren’t there when she was thirteen and flinging herself between her best friend and a mass murderer because she would die before she ever let someone touch him.
Hermione: Why would it bother me?
Lavender: *curious gleam in her eyes*

Ron: Doesn’t he think he should branch out a bit and make more friends? Have other friends than just Harry and Hermione?
Ron: I don’t need any other friends.
Ron's mother: *pursed her lips and turned away to bang a pot on the stove*
Ron: Why would I need other friends?
Ron: He’s not really sure he would know how to be friends with anyone else.
Ron: The only other person who comes close to understanding is Ginny and he doesn’t think that’s what his mum means when she said make more friends.
Lavender: Don’t you ever want to make other friends? Don’t you ever get tired of them?
Ron: Why do you care?
Lavender: Oh, no reason, I’m just curious.
Lavender: Do you ever get tired of being around Parvati?
Lavender: *her hand hasn’t gone and wrapped around the pendant on her neck in a death grip*"
1,22124083,Hermione,Ron,"Hermione: Fair point, Weasley. *her hand hasn’t gone and wrapped around the pendant on her neck in a death grip* She’s up and gone before he can do more than blink at her.

Harry: There are few things in life that Harry is one hundred percent certain of. But he knows that Hermione and Ron are his friends forever the same way he knows that the sun rises in the east and sets in the West. *He carries the guilt of every injury they get helping him and he worries that one day he’ll convince himself that leaving them is the only way to keep them safe.*

Harry: He’s not sure if they would let him leave. If he would even have the willpower to turn his back on them. But the guilt gets heavier every year. *He can still hear Ron’s scream from 3rd year, the sound of his bones snapping and the way he had still dragged himself in front of Harry and snarled threats at Sirius. Still remembers the way it had felt to look down at Hermione, frozen in the hospital bed, and really think about how close she had come to dying. How close they had been to losing her. Remembers the naked fear on Ron’s face when Ginny was taken. Hermione in her blood soaked shirt, crying over Ron in the ministry even as she grew paler and paler. Still catches himself staring at the looping scars curling their way around Ron’s arms.*

Harry: He doesn’t think he can convince himself to leave them but he also doesn’t think he’ll survive if he loses them. *Finds himself considering what would happen if Voldemort ever realizes the easiest way to kill him is to hurt them first.*

Harry: Sixth year so far has been a year of bad tempers, bad weather and strained friendships. *He knows his attitude is starting to wear on Hermione especially. The other Gryffindors have taken to avoiding him, having learned quickly that the only people able to deal with him were Hermione and Ron. If it was a good day Neville and Ginny would hang out with them, sometimes dragging Luna along. There were more bad days than good.*

Harry: Is that really what people think about them? That the three of them are sleeping together. *If this was a bad day he would storm out of the passageway and snarl at the second years to mind their own bloody business. But this is a good day and so he stands in the passageway long after the second years have left just thinking.*"
2,22124083,Ron,Hermione,"Ron: Are we dating? *sits up slowly, curls his finger into the grass and glances over at Hermione*
Hermione: When you say we, do you mean all three of us? *sitting against a tree, knuckles white around her book*
Harry: I heard some people talking about it, about how they think we are. How we are dating already that is.
Hermione: Do you want us to be?
Harry: I think so, yeah. *looks over at both of them* Ron, mate, are you alright?
Ron: *grinning, cheeks aching with the force of his smile* This feels right. Feels like forever. Like the rest of our life.
Hermione: *watching Ron grin at Harry, feeling bright and joyful*"
3,22124083,Harry,Ron,"Harry: *groans, pulls back from Ron, eyes wide and startled, lips spit slicked and parted.*
Ron: *pushes her hair out of the way to gently press a kiss against the side of her neck.*
Harry: *somewhere there are people watching but she finds that she really doesn’t care.*
Harry: Don’t you ever get sick of being around them?
Harry: Merlin, how could she ever get sick of them. No matter their tempers and all the ways they clash, they were hers. She’d burn the world to keep them at her side."
