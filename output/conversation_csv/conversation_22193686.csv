0,22193686,Emiya,Artoria,"Emiya: I want to talk to you. *withheld knowledge, tactics, strength, and even his Unlimited Bladeworks*
Emiya: This was not a Holy Grail War, and even if it had been, his new Master had no connection to his living past, no reason not to know.
Emiya: Eventually, little by little, Emiya had revealed himself.
Emiya: As he took on the role of a mentor to the young and unprepared Master, such a familiar case, he became very much at ease.
Emiya: He still had to kill -- he had to accept that was still part of his duty -- but now it was a matter, once again, of defending himself and those near to him.
Emiya: He was no longer squabbling over some mystic relic, or cleaning up the messes that humanity left behind itself -- he was fighting for the future of humanity.
Emiya: Finally, he had truly reached his ideal.
Emiya: Along the way, though, he admitted he had manipulated his Master several times.
Emiya: Each time he turned it into a lesson, and each time the outcome was good, but still.
Emiya: He feared Master had taken those lessons more to heart than he had intended.
Emiya: “What we talked about the other day--”
Emiya: “Idiot! I told you not to mention it!”
Emiya: “Right! It’s just, well -- I think you should mention it. To, you know -- Artoria.”
Emiya: Master certainly had a good heart, but lacked tact.
Emiya: Still, it had worked, more or less.
Emiya: With a little maneuvering from Emiya, they had “coincidentally” gotten the two of them together often enough so, eventually, they both gave in to their guilt and apologized.
Emiya: Now, Emiya finally realized, it wasn’t entirely pleasant to be on the receiving end of their “help”.
Lancer: Are you ready, Archer?
Emiya: Mm.
Emiya: He didn’t know what exactly Master was getting at, but he didn’t think he liked it.
Emiya: This mature, Lancer-class vision of Artoria from some other time stream was fairly new to Chaldea, but Master knew Emiya’s history.
Emiya: It was no coincidence that he was her final training partner today.
Lancer: Good. Then prepare yourself, Archer -- here I come!
Emiya: Just as he knew she would.
Emiya: Lancer was painfully similar to Saber, in terms of behavior, although she showed at once both more and even less emotion and maturity.
Emiya: She was a grown woman, well-rounded and very human, yet she still had the dispassion of not just a ruler, but a divinity.
Emiya: That lance… Its divinity fed into the Lancer, and it was a fighting style he had never observed in Saber, making her dangerous indeed.
Emiya: At least she had dismounted from Dun Stallion for training.
Emiya: Still, Emiya had fought many masters of spear and lance, including Ireland’s great Child of Light, and he had no time for fear or hesitation.
Emiya: He stood, empty-handed and motionless, waiting for the King of Knights as she charged him.
Emiya: A single flicker of doubt crossed her eyes when he still did not materialize a weapon or retreat -- unlike the reverse, Artoria had never seen Emiya fight before.
Emiya: He would relish the chance to see just how far he had come.
Lancer: When she reached him, all doubt and hesitation was gone.
Lancer: Artoria swung Rhongomyniad, and Emiya only barely dodged back, parrying the blow with the newly-projected shortswords in hand before spinning inside her guard.
Emiya: Immediately the King leapt back, avoiding his twisting strikes, and dashed back in.
Emiya: Even his eyes, reinforced with magecraft, a heroic spirit core, and his class as Archer, couldn’t follow the speed.
Emiya: He could only draw on experience, her starting position and stance, what he knew about the similar Artoria of his past--
Emiya: Faster than a mere human eye could follow, they clashed.
Emiya: Sparks flew and the cl..."
1,22193686,Emiya,Artoria,"Emiya: I doubt I could keep you at range.
Artoria: You think too little of yourself. You obviously have great experience.
Emiya: Then let us see if your praise is deserved.
Emiya: *dashes forward, projecting Kanshou and Bakuya in his hands again*
Emiya: *utilizes a technique he had spent years perfecting*
Emiya: *floods every circuit of his body with an instantaneous jolt of magical energy*
Emiya: *blinks out of existence, reappearing an instant later behind Artoria*
Artoria: Kuh!"
2,22193686,Emiya,Artoria,"Emiya: I am the bone of my sword. *pulls the blade from the hill and nocks it as he begins to fall* Hrunting!
Artoria: *lets a normal arrow through her defense, taking it on her left pauldron, and thrusts her lance forward* --! Rho--
Emiya: Archer. Who are you, to call upon two great Noble Phantasms of the Danes and the Greeks in one breath?
Artoria: Do not insult my honor, Archer.
Emiya: You’re mistaken, Lancer. It is an ugly thing, not fit for your presence. But be assured I am using it, unseen. I would not insult you by giving you less than my all.
Artoria: Thank you, Archer -- no, Emiya.
Emiya: Now -- shall we continue?
Artoria: Let’s. *spins her lance back into a new strike*
Emiya: Trace -- on! *swings the blades in a cross, and the edges of the blades overextend, becoming spiked, rough-looking broadswords*"
3,22193686,Emiya,Artoria,"Emiya: Trace -- on! *surges magical energy into the blades and swings them in a cross*
Artoria: *redirects her movement and ducks with a grunt of effort*
Emiya: *throws his weapons aside*
Artoria: *readies herself to face some new Noble Phantasm*
Emiya: *wields overhead a fine golden longsword*
Artoria: *fixes her eyes on the sword* A sword fit for a King. Which made Kings. Her sword.
Emiya: *stops his swing, the blade of Caliburn hovering near Artoria's face* The end.
Artoria: Indeed. *taps him gently with the point of Rhongomyniad*
Emiya: *leans back* A draw, then. Thank you for training with me, Sa-- Lancer.
Artoria: *smiles softly* Please -- refer to me as Artoria.
Emiya: Artoria. Not King Arthur?
Artoria: *shakes her head* I am no king in Chaldea. And without Caliburn or Avalon, my guise as 'Arthur' was... short-lived.
Emiya: *looks away* ... I used to dream of that sword, when I was alive. Its image is closer
Artoria: Shirou.
Emiya: Yes?
Artoria: My sword -- Caliburn. How...?
Emiya: *gazes at some distant horizon* ... I used to dream of that sword, when I was alive."
4,22193686,Artoria,Emiya,"Artoria: Yes. I like that.
Emiya: Shirou.
Artoria: My sword -- Caliburn. How...?
Emiya: ... I used to dream of that sword, when I was alive. Its image is closer to the original than any other I can create, save one. It is not much compared to your lance, but--
Artoria: Caliburn is a great blade. And -- you wield it with grace.
Emiya: Thanks.
Artoria: After training, it is only right for tired warriors to replenish their strength. I am told... you make excellent food.
Emiya: Damn. I take it back. You're all the same, aren't you?"
