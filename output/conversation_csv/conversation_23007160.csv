0,23007160,Peter Parker,Tony Stark,"Peter Parker: Hey, Mr. Stark, can I talk to you for a minute?
Tony Stark: *looks up from his work* Sure, kid. What's up?
Peter Parker: Well, I was thinking... maybe we could do some good publicity for the Avengers. You know, like a charity event or something.
Tony Stark: *smirks* You want to use our superhero status for some positive PR?
Peter Parker: Yeah, exactly! I think it would be great for our image and show people that we're not just a bunch of vigilantes.
Tony Stark: *leans back in his chair* I like the way you think, kid. Let's brainstorm some ideas and see what we can come up with.
Peter Parker: *grins* Awesome! I'll start doing some research and see if there are any organizations we can partner with.
Tony Stark: Sounds good, Spider-Man. Let's make sure the world knows that the Avengers are here to help."
1,23007160,Tony,Pepper,"Tony: That was a disaster. The press is having a field day.
Pepper: It wasn’t my fault. That Spider-Guy never knows when to shut up. He distracted me.
Tony: Your reputation took a blow. Which will be fixed, of course. I’ve already set it up.
Tony: Set what up? What, am I going to make flower arrangements with the elderly?
Pepper: Try an orphan. His name is Peter Parker. His biggest dream is to meet you. But…
Tony: But?
Pepper: Apparently he doesn’t talk much. Sometimes not at all. Trauma-related.
Tony: A smart kid who doesn’t talk? Perfect combination. If only all my employees were like that.
Tony: It seems we blotched this one.
Spider-Man: Really? What gave it away?
Tony: Shut up, dude. This wouldn’t have happened if you’d let me concentrate.
Spider-Man: I’m sorry."
2,23007160,Tony,Spider-Man,"Tony: “It seems we blotched this one.”
Spider-Man: “Really? What gave it away?”
Tony: “Shut up, dude. This wouldn’t have happened if you’d let me concentrate.”
Spider-Man: “I’m sorry, ‘concentrate’? I didn’t know that word was a part of your vocabulary. Maybe you meant ‘aggravate’? ‘Mutilate?’ ‘Annihilate’?”
Tony: “All right, smartass.”
Spider-Man: “Nauseate…”
Tony: “All right, Emily Dickinson. Let’s just be glad no one got hurt.”
Tony: “I’m glad you showed up. This is bad, but it could have been a lot worse. Of course, the press is going to claim otherwise.”
Spider-Man: “There are two reasons for it, Stark. The first reason is, I don’t want to, and the second happens to be that same reason also.”
Tony: “I am one hundred percent going to blame you for this clusterfuck.”
Spider-Man: “You are a real douchebag, you know that?”
Tony: “Yes.”

Pepper: “That was an utter disaster. The press is having a field day.”
Tony: “It wasn’t my fault. That Spider-Guy never knows when to shut up. Just an incessant stream of nonsense. He distracted me.”
Pepper: “Either way, your reputation took a blow. Nothing new. And just like the previous one hundred times, it will be fixed, of course. All we need is an inspired bit of good PR to get you back on that insanely high pedestal the public always puts you on. I’ve already set it up.”
Tony: “Set what up? What, am I going to make flower arrangements with the elderly? Organize a benefit for single mothers in Ethiopia?”
Pepper: “Try an orphan. His name is Peter Parker. He lives in a group home. He is fifteen. He is exceptionally intelligent. He loves superheroes. And his biggest dream is to meet the great Tony Stark. He was brought to my attention a few weeks ago by some foundation that makes dreams come true, you know the type. I didn’t act on it then, because I didn’t want him to be disappointed when he met the real you.”
Tony: “Harsh, Pep.”
Pepper: “I’m still worried about it, to be honest. We need the good publicity. But I’m worried you won’t be able to deal with him properly. Because…”
Tony: “Because?”
Pepper: “Apparently he doesn’t talk much. Sometimes not at all. Trauma-related.”
Tony: “All right. Set it up.”
Pepper: “That’s it? I thought you were going to be insufferable about this.”
Tony: “Please. A smart kid who doesn’t talk? Perfect combination. If only all my employees were like that.”"
3,23007160,Tony,Pepper,"Tony: All right. Set it up.
Pepper: That's it? I thought you were going to be insufferable about this.
Tony: Please. A smart kid who doesn't talk? Perfect combination. If only all my employees were like that.
Pepper: The last thing this boy needs is his big hero making fun of him.
Tony: You think I'll make fun of a kid for having issues? You don't exactly have a high opinion of me, do you?
Pepper: You're socially inept. You might not intend to make fun of him, but even just by being your sarcastic self, you can really throw people off.
Tony: Thanks for sugar-coating that for my benefit.
Melissa: Don't sweat it. Only thing you gotta remember is to not get all up on him about not talking. And don't worry, really. Everyone thinks he's all delicate because he's so quiet, but he ain't delicate at all, I'm telling ya. He can be a snarky little shit. He's just subtle about it.
Tony: All right, all right. How will I know what he wants to do? Does he... - are you in a tunnel or something? The connection is terrible - Does he write stuff down?
Melissa: Nah, it's not like that. He talks. It's just he generally sticks to only a few words. As for what he wants to do... Literally anything you can think of, I can guarantee he'll be all hot in the biscuit to do it with you. Can you hear me better now? I'm on my balcony. Smells of pigeons out here. He pretty much stopped talking after his aunt died.
Tony: Ah. He was close with her, then?
Melissa: She raised him. His parents died in an airplane crash when he was nine. He moved in with his uncle and aunt. His uncle was shot last year, and his aunt died about half a year ago in a fire.
Tony: Jesus Christ.
Melissa: Yeah, not all sunshine and rainbows. So thanks for doing this for him. Very altruistic of you.
Tony: *feels that Melissa knows exactly why Tony agreed to meeting Peter in this particular moment.*
Tony: Want to come down to my lab?
Peter: *nods*
Tony: I've been told you're a smart kid. What's your favorite subject?
Peter: *pulls at his shirt. It has a print of two glass vials, both containing a chemical substance. One vial is telling the other: I think you're overreacting!*
Tony: Okay, so the kid really doesn't talk. You like chemistry?
Peter: *nods with a small smile*
Tony: I can work with that. I do work with that. Not always successfully. I almost blew up my lab just last week. You should have seen Pepper's face - uh, she's my fiancée. At least,"
4,23007160,Tony,Peter,"Tony: I think you're overreacting!
Vial: Okay, so the kid really doesn't talk.
Tony: You like chemistry?
Peter: *nods with a small smile*
Tony: I can work with that. I do work with that. Not always successfully. I almost blew up my lab just last week. You should have seen Pepper's face - uh, she's my fiancée. At least, I think she is. I tried proposing to her but she just sort of rolled her eyes. Come to think of it, I should get back to her about that.
Tony: Welcome to the best place on earth. Apart from the Seychelles. I have a little mansion down there, it's lovely. Haven't been there in five years, with everything going on, so it might have completely caved in by now.
Peter: *quietly steps into the workplace, his eyes scanning the whole room carefully*
Peter: *points at Tony's Iron Man suit on a table in the middle of the room*
Tony: Yeah, yeah. The suit. We'll get to that. First, let me show you what I'm working on right now.
Tony: *puts his hands on Peter's shoulders, steering him towards one of the workbenches*
Tony: You know Hawkeye? Of course you do. You know his arrows? Of course you do. I'm trying to make him a set of explosive arrows. The explosion should be remote controlled. So I need a stable explosive that will not detonate immediately when hitting something, but that will explode with an additional catalyst charge. And the explosion won't do any damage without some form of accessory fragmentation. But obviously arrows are required to be light, so I can't just stuff it full of C-4. Right? So I'm facing a problem.
Peter: *carefully picks up the hollow metal arrow lying on the workbench, staring down at it, slowly turning it over in his hands*
Peter: Hemispherical cavity metal detonators.
Tony: *blinks, needing a moment to process that*
Tony: You're talking about the Munroe effect?
Peter: *gives a slight nod*
Tony: Christ, kid. They told me you were smart. They didn't say you were a genius. You're like a fun-size Thomas Edison.
Peter: *shakes his head*
Tony: No?
Peter: Tesla.
Tony: *bursts out laughing* Sure. Nikola Tesla. Either way, you're fun-size, funsy.
Tony: *glances down at the arrow in Peter's hand, then back up at Peter* Do you want to try and make the calculations?
Peter: *face lights up*"
5,23007160,Tony,Spider-Man,"Tony: You know Spider-Man?
Peter: *makes eye-contact, cocks his head, then slowly nods*
Tony: You may have seen on the news that he’s been working with us lately. You might say he is on the team. Except he isn’t. Because we have no idea who he is and I don’t actually have a way to contact him. He just shows up, usually. I probably shouldn’t be telling you this. Ah, what am I saying? It’s not like you’ll tell anyone else.
Peter: *smiles, dropping his pencil and leaning his head on his arms as he listens*
Tony: I’ve been trying to create algorithms and find a pattern in his behavior, uncover his identity, but every time I feel like I’m getting close to him, his behavior suddenly changes completely. Either he is on to me and messing with me on purpose, or he has for some reason moved to a new neighborhood at least three times over the last six months.
Peter: *frowns, leaning in. He reaches out and points his pencil towards the words ‘Predicting Criminal Behavior’ at the top of Tony’s screen. More specifically, at the word ‘criminal’.*
Tony: No, he’s not a criminal. But if I’m going to put my life in someone’s hands, I want to know more about the guy than just that he’s terrible at making costumes.
Peter: *chuckles. He stands up, moving over to Tony’s workbench.*
Tony: *follows his movements for a while, before turning back to the screen and the infuriatingly chaotic collection of red dots all over the map of New York that indicate all past Spider-Man sightings in the city.*
Peter: *pops up next to him and places something tiny on the desk in front of him. “You’re suggesting a tracker?”*
Tony: *sighs, running a hand across his face. “I have thought about that. I’m sure I could find a way to stick one to his onesie. But I’m worried he’d notice it, and then we’ll never see him again. I don’t want to chase the guy away. I just want a name and a face. And I don’t want him to know that I know. Does that make sense?”*
Peter: *shakes his head with a deadpan expression.*
Tony: Fair enough. At least you’re honest. *picks up the tracker* Hmmm. You know what, maybe I’ll rethink this. If I use a really small tracker, I bet I could get away with it. And it’ll definitely be effective. Thanks, kid. If this works, I’ll buy you a beer. Oh, shit, no. I’ll buy you a lemonade, I guess.
Peter: *smiles*"
6,23007160,Peter,Tony Stark,"Peter: Stay?
Tony: You wanna stay a little longer?
Peter: *nods with a hopeful expression*
Tony: *takes out his phone* Hey. It’s Tony Stark. Are you on your way here yet?
Melissa: Just about to leave.
Tony: Can we give it a few more hours? We’re in the middle of a project and the kid is really caught up in it. He said he wants to stay.
Melissa: I can do six o’clock.
Tony: Perfect.
FRIDAY: Melissa has arrived at the compound and is currently parking her car.
Peter: *hugs his notebook close to his chest, looking up at Tony with a wistful expression* Thank you.
Tony: *swallows, squeezing Peter’s shoulder* Thank you, kid. You did me a real solid. I had fun today. You have a very bright future ahead of you. Send me your CV after you graduate, okay?
Peter: *nods, his eyes full of a gratitude that Tony doesn’t really feel he deserves.*
-Melissa: Good times?
Peter: *nods fervently*
Melissa: *nods at Tony* Thank you. I’ll have him send his report to the Grainger foundation over the weekend, so it’ll appear on their website sometime next week.
Tony: Is there any way he can stay for dinner?
Melissa: *raises a single eyebrow* You can stay too, if you want. I feel bad for making you drive out here. You like Thai food?
Tony: Thing is, I’m off the clock in about an hour. And I got four damn kids waiting for me at home. So I have to take him back to the group home, now.
Tony: He could stay the night. Are you back on the clock tomorrow? I can have him dropped off at his school.
Melissa: *gapes at him, before turning to Peter, pointing her thumb at Tony* This guy holding you hostage? Blink twice if yes.
Peter: *giggles*
Melissa: Let me talk to the kiddo for a moment. *beckoning Peter to walk with her*
Tony: *impatiently waits as Melissa has a hushed and mostly one-sided discussion with Peter on the other side of the entrance hall*
Melissa: All right. Joseph has the night shift. I need to clear this with him. If it’s okay with him, it’s okay with me. And if shit hits the fan tonight, for any reason, call him. Uh – that’s just my number, he takes over the phone. Also, I assume you can take care of stuff like PJ’s and a toothbrush? Because I ain’t driving up and down just for that.
Tony: Done. *lifts a hand to clap it down on Peter’s shoulder* I’ll take care of him, promise."
7,23007160,Spider-Man,Iron Man,"Spider-Man: “Hey, asshole! Watch where you fire those lasers!”
Iron Man: “Ah, look who decided to show up. Our Spider-ling in his onesie! Late as usual.”
Spider-Man: “Well, unlike you I don’t have an expensive AI telling me where to go all the time.”
Iron Man: “File your complaint up my ass, kid!”
Spider-Man: “I would, but your head is already up there.”
Captain America: “Can we focus?”"
8,23007160,Spider-Man,Tony,"Spider-Man: I want to talk to you, *swings from lamppost to lamppost*
Tony: Well, unlike you I don’t have an expensive AI telling me where to go all the time.
Spider-Man: File your complaint up my ass, kid!
Tony: I would, but your head is already up there.
Captain America: We’re not done yet. Tony, take Spider-Man with you, secure the outer ring, east side.
Tony: Underoos you’re with me! Keep up!
Spider-Man: What do they want this time?
Tony: Just attention, if you ask me!
Spider-Man: Hey – umpf – maybe not the best time to bring this up, but ah – ngnghh, damnit – those contraptions look a lot like whatever the Chitauri flew in on, way back when. Any chance those aliens set up their own little dealership somewhere in lower Manhattan or something?
Tony: Can we shoot ‘em first and talk later?
Spider-Man: Got him!
Tony: Rogers – we’re all good on this side.
Spider-Man: One of them ruined my suit. It’s like I spend half my time making new ones.
Tony: Really? And you still haven’t come up with anything better than those pajamas?
Steve: Always good to see you, Spider-Man. Thanks for keeping Tony from getting himself killed yet again.
Spider-Man: At your service. Between the two of us, I suppose we can keep him from flying into a building.
Tony: If I fly into a building, if anything, I’ll be fine and the building will crumble. Unlike the two of you, who prefer to prance around in lycra.
Steve: Hang on, Romanoff. We’re all going home. Care to join us?
Spider-Man: Nah. Ever seen a spider eat? They will literally puke digestive fluid all over their food and then suck everything back in. --- Jeez, don’t look at me all bug-eyed, that was a joke, guys. Point is, I’m not coming. Enjoy the lasagna.
Tony: Maybe another time.
Spider-Man: Not likely. Okay, byeeee."
9,23007160,Tony Stark,Spider-Man,"Tony: Maybe another time. *steps closer and puts a hand on Spider-Man's shoulder* Not likely. Okay, byeeee.
Spider-Man: *runs towards the edge of the building and jumps off, firing webs as he swings away*

Tony: *lifts his hand to his earpiece* FRIDAY, is the tracker in place?
FRIDAY: I have a signal. It's moving east.
Steve: *throws him a puzzled look* You put a tracker on him? I thought you had promised him that he could keep his identity a secret?
Tony: Yeah, well, I'm a liar, Rogers. FRIDAY, let me know as soon as he stops moving.

Maria Hill: *opens the backdoor of a van* I'll have this delivered to the compound. How long until you can give us an update? *starts scribbling out a form*
Tony: I'll look at it this afternoon. Can't promise how much I'll find. It looks like chitauri tech.
Maria Hill: I agree. Now I just want to know where the hell it came from.
Tony: And I'm guessing 'space' won't be a satisfactory response?
Maria Hill: *tears the form from her clipboard and holds it out to Tony* Can I trust you not to completely screw up the paperwork?
Tony: Honestly? Probably not. *stuffs the paper into a pocket* Give Fury a big kiss for me.

Tony: *turns and walks back to his Iron Man suit, lifting one hand to his earpiece* No updates on the tracker yet, FRI?
FRIDAY: The signal has left New York and is moving northwest.
Tony: *halts* What? He left the city?
FRIDAY: The speed and location suggest that he is on the train to Hartford.
Tony: *thinks* The hell? Did Spider-Man jump straight on a train right after the mission? All right, update me as soon as he leaves the tracks.

Tony: *prepares for the worst-case scenario* All right, FRI, calculate my route. I'm flying down there.
FRIDAY: The tracker has not left the train tracks, but it has been stationary for fifteen minutes.
Tony: Where?
FRIDAY: Hartford train station.
Tony: *has a bad feeling about this* Damn.

Tony: *calls Melissa* Hi, Melissa? It's Tony Stark. I was wondering if maybe Peter could come over again some time this week.
Melissa: Come over, *echoes, sounding stumped*
Tony: Only if he wants to. *quickly adds*
Melissa: Oh, I think he'll want to. Never seen the kid so excited.
Tony: *feels a warm feeling spreading through his chest* I can have him picked up. Wednesday?
Melissa: That's... I mean... All right, *sounds a little reluctant*
Tony: Perfect. Can I just ask... His speaking... Does he have a diagnosis or something?
Melissa: Not exactly. Some therapists have suggested selective mutism, but it doesn't fit great. I don't know, psychology is complicated shit. All I can say is people deal with trauma in different ways. We can't always label it.
Tony: Hm.
Melissa: Look, I'm sorry if this question offends you, but I gotta know. Is all this still part of your little PR stunt, or is this for real? I just want to be clear if you're going to drop this kid like a hot brick once you..."
10,23007160,Tony,Melissa,"Tony: I want to talk to you, *Tony walks towards Melissa*
Melissa: Hm.
Tony: Look, I’m sorry if this question offends you, but I gotta know. Is all this still part of your little PR stunt, or is this for real? I just want to be clear if you’re going to drop this kid like a hot brick once you’re back in everyone’s favor.
Melissa: Does it matter? The words come out before Tony even thinks about them. The kid gets a few awesome days at the compound, and I get my reputation back.
Melissa: No, I suppose it doesn’t matter, Melissa says, finally. Just as long as we’re all clear.
Pepper: Oh, you’re so sweet!
Peter: You suck-up, Tony tells him, and Peter smirks.
Pepper: Shall I show you how to properly cut them and put them in a vase?
Tony: Pepper, please, Tony scoffs. This kid has an IQ the size of Mount Everest. He’s not here to learn how to use scissors. He’s here to calculate the required torque for base rotation in an Iron Man suit.
Pepper: Is that right? Pepper asks. Peter, do you want to calculate the required whatever for base whatever, or learn how to cut flowers?
Peter: Flowers, Peter says, with a grin in Tony’s direction.
Tony: He’s only saying that to mess with me, Tony grumbles.
Pepper: Just sit down, Pepper says, pointing at a chair. You could learn something, too.
Tony: Damnit, kid, he mutters.
Peter: *Peter giggles*
Peter: Wrong, Peter bluntly informs him, pointing at the hologram floating in front of them.
Tony: All right, funsy, all right, I’m still working it out, don’t get on my case. What’s… what’s wrong with it? Oh, yes, I see what you mean.
Tony: Tracker didn’t work, unfortunately, he says. In fact, it backfired pretty damn hard. And now Spider-Man might be pissed off at me. Any other ideas on how to catch him?
Peter: *Peter sits in the desk chair next to him and leafs through his notebook until he reaches the page with his cartoonish drawing of Scarlet Witch, then looks up at Tony with a questioning gaze as he turns the notebook towards him.*
Tony: I’ve asked her, but she said it doesn’t work that easily. I don’t know, I don’t have a PhD on mindreading. Plus, she has a thing about… I don’t know… the ethical side of it, or some bullshit like that. Honestly, I think she just has a little crush on the guy.
Peter: *Peter’s eyebrows shoot into his hairline.*
Tony: Which, you know, is weird since none of us have seen his face, Tony continues.
Peter: Ugly, Peter suggests with a playful expression.
Tony: *Tony chuckles.* Yeah, you’re right, that might be why. Either way, that’s another dead end. What else ya got?"
11,23007160,Tony,Peter,"Tony: I want to talk to you. *raises his hand in a pistol hand-gesture*
Peter: *gives a questioning glance*
Tony: Nah. He’s on our side. I’m not going to go that far.
Peter: Good.

Steve: Do you prefer potatoes or rice? *asks Peter*
Peter: *stares at Steve*
Tony: Lay off him, Rogers. If he wants something, he’ll just take it.
Steve: *pushes several serving dishes closer to Peter*
Peter: Ice cream.
Steve: What? Uh – you want ice cream? On your chicken? Are you – are you sure? I mean, we have -
Tony: Rogers, he’s messing with you.
Peter: *giggles*

Tony: Next time do your homework first, all right?
Peter: Next time.
Tony: Well, yeah. I mean… I don’t know, I haven’t really thought about it. But we can do it again next week. Only if you want to, of course.
Peter: *starts digging through his backpack*
Tony: *glances towards Pepper*
Pepper: *keeps her eyes steadily on her book*
Tony: *turns back to Peter*
Peter: *holds his phone out to Tony, pointing at the blog at the Grainger Foundation website*
Tony: Nah, kid. You don’t have to do that anymore. They only set up our first meeting. This one’s all you and me, right?
Peter: Good publicity.
Tony: Yeah. The publicity doesn’t matter. It’s just… I’m… not very good."
12,23007160,Tony,Spider-Man,"Tony: The publicity doesn't matter. It's just... I'm... not very good at stability, long-term plans, responsibility. All cards on the table; I like you around, kid. I don't know, I see something in you. But I have no idea how I'll feel a month from now. That's not about you, it's about me. I'm an asshole.

Spider-Man: Thanks for stopping by, underoos, but we got it under control.
Yeah?
Nothing personal.
I know."
13,23007160,Tony,Peter,"Tony: “Why haven’t I heard this before?”
Peter: “It’s not like I have a way of contacting you that wouldn’t also be a danger to my identity.”
Tony: “You could always just swing by the compound.”
Peter: “Who’s to say you won’t jump me and force my mask off?”
Tony: “I could do that right now if I wanted to. But I don’t want us to be enemies.”
Peter: “Well, we both already know you put a tracker on me. How much would really change if you put me in a choke-hold right now?”
Tony: “You make a convincing case, Spider-Man. Maybe I’ll do that.”
Spider-Man: “That’s my cue I guess,” *jokes* and, without another word of goodbye, he sprints towards the edge of the building and jumps off.
Tony: “You’re a little quiet today, funsy,”
Peter: *doesn’t respond*
Tony: “Sad,” Peter then murmurs.
Peter: “Anything I can help with?”
Tony: “Yeah, I know what you mean. Let me know if you’d rather go home, okay?”
Peter: “It’s not home,” Peter says, his voice breaking.
Tony: “Can I give you a hug?” He asks.
Peter: *sniffling quietly*
Tony: “After my parents died, I holed up in my workshop and didn’t talk to anyone for at least two weeks,” Tony says, as he slowly rubs a hand up and down Peter’s back. “Until Rhodey dragged my ass out and took me fishing. I’d like to emphasize that that’s the only time I have ever been, and will ever go fishing. I was bored out my skull. I strongly suspect that Rhodey only forced me to come to show me that life could always get worse.”
Peter: *gives a soft chuckle* “Lonely?” He asks.
Tony: “Yeah, of course. Especially at first. It takes some time to bring new people into your life that you can call family. But it happens, eventually. I promise you. I didn’t forget my parents. But I can think about them now without feeling sad. You’ll be okay, Peter. Maybe not tomorrow, or even next month, but you will be.”
Peter: *hums*"
14,23007160,Peter,Tony,"Peter: Yeah, I get how that topic would piss you off. *leans back in his chair, planting one elbow on the desk* How about you focus on the city, rather than your family? You've lived in New York your whole life, right? What does this city mean to you?
Tony: Is that an idea? *leans back in his chair, planting one elbow on the desk* You can have bad days. It won't make you any less welcome here.
Spider-Man: You said I could swing by. *as soon as Tony's head appears through the roof hatch*
Tony: What's up, underoos?
Spider-Man: I found out who's dealing in weapons. Name's Adrian Toomes. He's the one who built the wing suit with Chitauri technology. I don't know where he's getting the stuff, but he's getting it.
Tony: And you know this how?
Spider-Man: I just know.
Tony: I'm going to need more than that before I call the FBI on his ass.
Spider-Man: Found the suit in his garage.
Tony: And how did you know what garage to break into?
Spider-Man: I didn't break into -- Does it matter?
Tony: Listen, I solved it, you're welcome. Just do your job and keep those weapons out of my neighborhood from now on.
Spider-Man: Been paying attention to me, have you?
Tony: Didn't the tracker make that obvious already?
Spider-Man: Made it obvious that you're an asshole.
Tony: Sorry.
Spider-Man: You know I don't think you're actually an asshole, right? That's just stuff I say to mess with you. You're not an asshole.
Tony: You should get to know me.
Spider-Man: I know you. You're nice.
Tony: You're insane.
Spider-Man: Fine, if you feel that strongly about it, I'll stick to 'asshole'.
Tony: How come you never bring me flowers?"
15,23007160,Tony,Spider-Man,"Tony: “You’re insane.”
Spider-Man: “Fine, if you feel that strongly about it, I’ll stick to ‘asshole’.”
Tony: “How come you never bring me flowers?”
Peter: “Oh, you… you did bring me something. You know I was just messing around, right? You don’t have to get me anything.”
Peter: *raises his eyebrows and drops his eyes down to the gift*
Tony: *tears the wrapping paper away* “You little shit.”
Peter: *cackles with glee, clapping his hands together*
Tony: “So, do you suggest I hang this down in my workshop so I’m reminded of it every day, or on the fridge in the kitchen where everyone can see it?”
Peter: *points at the fridge*
Tony: “There is not one Spider-Man. There are multiple people pretending to be the same guy. That would explain the weird algorithms. That theory does require a group of people to have acquired the same super-human strengths at the same time, though. So maybe I’m wrong.”
Peter: *glances at him for a moment*
Tony: “We’ve stopped the Chitauri attacks. Some guy named Adrian Toomes was behind them. Nipped that in the bud. Now all I have to do is see if I can use Toomes to trace down Spider-Man. Or the Spider-Men. Because I have a feeling they know each other. Any ideas?”
Peter: “Give up?”
Tony: “Not an option, I’m afraid. But you get on with your own work, I’ll crack this nut on my own.”
Peter: *stands up, picking up his laptop and moving closer to Tony*
Peter: *turns his screen towards Tony*
Tony: “He could be a member of loads of clubs, though. If I have to include all his connections in my research, this will take an eternity.”
Peter: “Garage.”"
16,23007160,Tony,connections,"Tony: If I have to include all his connections in my research, this will take an eternity.
Coincidence?

Not yet."
17,23007160,Tony,Pepper,"Tony: What happened, funsy?
Pepper: *frowns sadly* Did you call Melissa?
Tony: Not yet. *steps into his office to make the call*
Melissa: *picks up the call* Peter with you?
Tony: Yeah.
Melissa: Thank god. Why didn’t I think of that? How is he?
Tony: Upset.
Melissa: Yeah, Thing is, he keeps clashing with another kid in the home, Denzel, a boy his age who has some anger issues.
Tony: Is that what happened today?
Melissa: Apparently. Possibly other underlying problems. But I wouldn’t know because he doesn’t tell me, now, does he?
Tony: Does it happen a lot?
Melissa: Quite a lot. He never ran away before, though. I guess he never had anywhere to run to before.
Tony: Can’t he be moved to a new group home?
Melissa: This is already his third home in six months. At some point you have to try and achieve some stability. We’re hoping they’ll learn to get along. Or ignore each other, at least.
Tony: That’s shitty.
Melissa: I know it’s fucking shitty, Stark, but it’s the best we can do. You tell me how to fix it. I got a teenager with anger issues, another one who doesn’t talk, a twelve-year-old with anorexia and little twins who were given drugs by their parents and are now going through withdrawal. Peter is not the only kid who deserves better.
Tony: I’m sorry.
Melissa: I work sixty-hour weeks, you know, and I only get paid forty.
Tony: I’m sorry.
Melissa: It’s fine. Shouldn’t be venting at you. Any chance you can drop him off? I have my hands full down here right now.
Tony: Can he stay here tonight?
Melissa: Yeah, that’s probably best. I’ll let Joseph know. Thank you.
Tony: Anytime. *returns to the living area*
Tony: You had a fight with Denzel?
Peter: *nods* Sorry, it’s stupid.
Tony: Apparently that kid has anger issues.
Peter: S’not his fault. His dad beat him up. He has trauma. I never got beat up. I’m lucky.
Pepper: It’s not a competition, Pete.
Tony: *puts his phone away* You’re sleeping here tonight, okay?
Peter: *nods*
Tony: *slowly pacing around the living area, broodily staring out the windows*
Pepper: I know what you’re thinking about.
Tony: I shouldn’t be thinking about it.
Pepper: Why not?
Tony: I’m impulsive. And fickle. What if I take him in and then, after a few months, I just get tired of him and start to resent him? He doesn’t deserve that.
Pepper: You’re wrong. You’re not impulsive when it comes to people. Look at me. Look at Happy, Rhodey. At Steve, Natasha. How long have we all been here?
Tony: Can’t stand them."
18,23007160,Pepper,Tony,"Pepper: You’re wrong. You’re not impulsive when it comes to people. Look at me. Look at Happy, Rhodey. At Steve, Natasha. How long have we all been here?
Tony: Can’t stand them.
Pepper: Keep telling yourself that. The truth is that you are very loyal. Trust me, that’s not the problem. The problem is whether the state will even let you have him. You’d need to survive a background check, go through training…
Tony: How do you know so much about foster care?
Pepper: I googled it.
Tony: How long have you been thinking about this?
Pepper: Since he gave you the Captain America magnet.
Tony: What, something clicked right then?
Pepper: I saw the way you looked at him.
Tony: So what’s the deal with us, Pep? Are we getting married or not?
Pepper: Of course we are.
Tony: Sickness and health, thick and thin, all that? Where would Peter figure into all that?
Pepper: Everywhere, I suppose.
Tony: There’s something else you should know.

Melissa: Hey – oh, hey.
Peter: Sorry.
Melissa: We’ll discuss it this afternoon. Now, get your ass upstairs, go shake Denzel’s hand and pack for school. Coffee?
Tony: Sure.
Melissa: How many people live here?
Tony: Just black.
Melissa: Have a seat. I hope you’ll be able to digest this stuff. It ain’t even my favorite coffee, and I’m pretty sure my standards aren’t as high as yours.
Peter: *rolls his eyes*
Tony: That was fast. You sure you got everything?
Peter: *nods*
Tony: Did you get your Captain America breadbox?
Peter: Black Widow.
Tony: Oh, is that right?
Melissa: There’s Sayan. Pete and Denzel got into a fight. But they’re all good now, aren’t you, Pete?
Peter: *remains stony-faced*"
19,23007160,Pete,Denzel,"Tony: Any specifics?
Sayan: Pete and Denzel got into a fight. But they’re all good now, aren’t you, Pete?
Melissa: See? Never been better.
Sayan: Hello sirs and madams. The car’s out front. May I help you with your coat?
Melissa: Time to go, Pete. Put on a coat, it’s going to rain later.
Peter: See you?
Tony: Of course, funsy. See you soon.
Melissa: I can’t believe how much he talks to you.
Tony: Really? Here I was worried that he was being too quiet. I wanted to impress you.
Melissa: Why?
Tony: Uh – I wanted to discuss something important.
Melissa: Let’s go to the office.
Tony: Does Peter have any kind of prospects for, uh, a foster family or something? Is that even on the table? I don’t know how this stuff works.
Melissa: It’s always on the table. But older children are hard to place. There was one couple about four months ago who were considering it, but they quickly turned out to be assholes. Peter’s a tough kid, though. Doesn’t let anyone mess with him. The first time that bitch slapped him in the face, he packed his bags and came right back to the group home. That’s why I trust you, Stark. Because I know Peter wouldn’t put up with your shit if you gave him shit. That is one advantage of growing up in a loving home. He knows when he’s not being treated right.
Tony: So what needs to happen for me to get him?
Melissa: First thing you have to do is talk to your housemates. Because if you’re actually going to follow through on this thing, all adults in your home will be up for evaluation. And you’ll have a heck of a time convincing the agency that someone like Dr. Banner doesn’t pose a safety threat to children.
Tony: This is impossible.
Melissa: I don’t think your chances are as bad as you think. Let’s see… irregular lifestyle, unusual home environment, somewhat questionable reputation…
Tony: You were explaining how my chances weren’t that bad?
Melissa: You know the kid. Policy says it is always in the best interest of the child if they can go to someone they're already comfortable with. It could be considered a ‘kinship placement’. They are a lot easier to arrange. You are single, yes?"
20,23007160,Melissa,Tony,"Melissa: You were explaining how my chances weren't that bad?
Melissa: You know the kid, Melissa says simply. Policy says it is always in the best interest of the child if they can go to someone they're already comfortable with. It could be considered a 'kinship placement'. They are a lot easier to arrange. You are single, yes?
Tony: Engaged, actually.
Melissa: That'll improve your chances. Unless it's former KGB-agent Miss Romanoff who you're engaged to.
Tony: Pepper Potts. Stark CEO.
Melissa: Have her file the paperwork. Your name isn't the first thing they should see when evaluating your application, no offense.
Tony: Fully agree.
Melissa: And if your application does get rejected... I'm sure Tony Stark has a way around that.
Tony: Tony narrows his eyes. Are you telling me to cheat my way into getting this kid into my home?
Melissa: Melissa casually studies her long nails. What if I am?

Tony: I just need to discuss something, Tony explains, evasively.
Happy: All right.
Tony: Say, Hap, do you still have that engagement ring?
Happy: Been carrying it since 2008.
Tony: Okay, good. Because I'm pretty sure she said 'yes' last night.
Happy: Pretty sure?
Tony: I mean, it wasn't a literal 'yes', but she said we were getting married. I definitely remember her saying something like that. Which boils down to the same thing, doesn't it?
Happy: Whatever happened to good, old-fashioned, tradition? Happy laments. You get on one knee, she says either 'yes' or 'no' and then we all know what the hell is going on.
Tony: Just remind me to give it to her later.
Happy: Sure, Happy turns the wheel and brings the car to a stop. Here we are.
Tony: Tony looks up at the group home, taking a deep breath in. All right. I won't be too long.
Happy: Good luck, Happy says, a knowing glint in his eyes.

-Melissa: Don't take it personally if he is doubtful, all right? Melissa says. He loves spending time with you. I've seen that. But this is a huge step, and he can have his reasons to be hesitant.
Tony: Can he say no?
Melissa: Not technically, unless he has a very good reason. He can file a complaint about his placement, but only once he has already been living with you for a while and has given it a fair shot. Of course, it's up to you to decide to withdraw if you get a sense that he doesn't want to do it. But let's gauge his reaction first and then talk strategy.
Tony: Sure, Tony says, impatiently tapping his fingers against his crossed leg. He is pretty sure that he has barely registered all the information Melissa has dumped on him since they sat down in the office. He just wants to see the kid.
Melissa: I'll ask him to come down, then, Melissa says. I'll just quickly discuss the formalities with him, and then I'll leave you two to talk things over, all right?
Tony: Sure."
21,23007160,Tony Stark,Pepper Potts,"Tony: I’ll ask him to come down, then. I’ll just quickly discuss the formalities with him, and then I’ll leave you two to talk things over, all right?
Melissa: All right.
Tony: *stands from his chair and paces around the room as he waits*
Peter: Hey.
Tony: Hey kid. *gives an encouraging smile*
Melissa: Take a seat.
Peter: *sits down*
Melissa: Mr. Tony Stark and Mrs. Pepper Potts are planning to apply to become your permanent foster parents. That application is not yet final – and frankly, might take some work to get approved – but if it does, you’ll be moving in with them. They would become your primary guardians and assume all responsibility over you. You would move out of the group home entirely. You will remain in the same school. Any questions so far?
Peter: *gaping at her*
Melissa: No? Then I’ll leave you to talk it over. Come out whenever you’re ready.
Tony: *slowly turns to Peter*
Peter: *staring at the empty seat that Melissa has vacated*
Tony: Pete, look at me.
Peter: *turns to look at Tony*
Tony: I just need to know how you feel about this, okay? First reaction? Horrified, relieved, confused?
Peter: *stands up from his chair and hugs Tony*
Tony: *lowers his arms around Peter* Does that mean you want to do this? Because I want you to know that it’s perfectly okay if you don’t. You’ll still be welcome to come to the tower once a week.
Peter: *releases Tony and returns to his chair, remaining silent*
Tony: Melissa suggested that, while we wait for this application, you could stay with us on the weekends instead of Wednesdays, so we have more time together. And even if this foster thing falls through, we can always keep doing that, all right? Or I create an internship for you and you come over every day. Or we get you emancipated when you’re sixteen and you move in then. The point is, no matter what, you have us. Understand?
Peter: *looks down at his hands*
Tony: *kneels in front of Peter's chair* How are you feeling right now?
Peter: I’m Spider-Man.
Tony: *startled* I know, kiddo. I know. But thanks for telling me.
Peter: *looks up with a startled expression* Everyone?
Tony: No, just me and Pepper know.
Peter: How long?
Tony: I’ve known for maybe two weeks. Told Pepper last night.
Peter: Asshole!
Tony: Hey! You’re the one who bullshitted me into putting a tracker on Spider-Man’s suit, and made me fly all the way to Hartford!"
22,23007160,Tony,Peter,"Tony: Everyone? *whispers*
Peter: No, just me and Pepper know.
Tony: How long?
Peter: I've known for maybe two weeks. Told Pepper last night.
Tony: Asshole!
Peter: *chuckles softly, his shoulders relaxing* That was funny.
Tony: You little shit. *says with a fond smile, reaching out to take one of Peter's hands in his* It doesn't matter. It's not an obstacle. And it wasn't a requirement either. It's just... a happy coincidence. Pepper and I feel like the three of us fit together. We hope you feel the same way.
Peter: *slowly nods, flexing his fingers and turning his hand over so he can interlace his fingers with Tony's*
Tony: I don't know how this is going to work out. I probably won't pass a lot of the tests. I considered not telling you until I had everything sorted, just in case it falls through and it was all for nothing. But I want you to know. I want you to know that I'm going to fight for you. We're going to fight for you.
Peter: *looks up at him again, his face hopeful and full of raw emotion, tears shining behind his eyes* Thank you."
23,23007160,Steve,Tony,"Steve: Even if he is enhanced, he is not a soldier. He is a kid. His abilities shouldn’t determine what happens to him.
Tony: You can’t possibly think that his powers are the reason why we want to take him in.
Steve: So, it’s just a coincidence?
Tony: Oh – no, Rogers, you’re right. I already have Bruce’s lab prepared to start experimenting on him as soon as he steps foot in this place!
Pepper: Tony, calm down.
Tony: I don’t like what he’s insinuating.
Pepper: He’s looking out for Peter. You should be happy about that.
Tony: Right. Thanks for looking out for my kid by accusing me of child abuse.
Steve: I didn’t say that. I just figured that Fury was probably behind this.
Tony: He doesn’t know. No one at SHIELD knows, and I’d like to keep it that way for the time being. At least until the paperwork is final and they can’t try to meddle with it.
Natasha: You don’t trust Fury?
Tony: I trust him to think in humanity’s best interest. That leaves it up to us to think in Peter’s interest. Can I trust you not to go blabbing to him, Romanoff? Barton?
Natasha: Sure, but only because the kid is so damn cute.
Clint: I second that. But, ah, have you all met Peter? And have you all met Spider-Man? Please explain to me again how they are the same person? Is the non-speaking thing part of his cover?
Tony: It’s not. Honestly, we haven’t discussed it much. But I imagine he finds it easier to speak freely when no one knows it’s him.
Clint: So now that we know it’s him, are we gonna get a quiet Spider-Man?
Tony: I don’t know, Barton, we’re just figuring it out as we go along. We have some kind of foster care workshop tomorrow, FYI, so Pepper and I won’t be here for dinner.
Rhodey: You’re actually going to those?
Tony: Might as well. It’s not like we have a lot of experience to fall back on. I might pick up something useful. And there’s only going to be a handful of other people, so I don’t think our appearance will cause a stampede.
Rhodey: Can you just talk us through how you came to this decision?
Tony: He just fits in. Pepper and I both feel it. If you’re asking me to explain it – I can’t. It’s just a feeling. Frankly, I don’t need any of you to approve. But if you disapprove, I’ll thank you to keep it to yourself and just let us raise the kid.
Rhodey: You’ll make a good dad."
24,23007160,Tony,Melissa,"Tony: I want to talk to you, *walks towards Melissa*, It's urgent!
Melissa: I'm not sure, she says. I'll send you a list of names. Start there.
Tony: What do you need? He asks each of them. Fancy new car, fancy new carpet in your office, a big fat portrait of you by the reception?
Melissa: You don't have to bribe me, Tony, she shoots back, using his first name for the first time.
Tony: Just tell me. I owe you a huge favor.
Melissa: Tony, believe me. We're good. The only thing these kids really need is new families. You've already done me the biggest favor possible by taking Peter in.
Tony: We can pick him up straight away, right? Tony asks, eagerly. I mean - this thing is effective immediately. Can we just come get him?
Melissa: We usually drive them. Gives them a bit more time to say goodbye down here. I'll drop him off around six, okay?
Tony: I'll take that, Tony says. He takes the bag from Peter, quickly squeezing his shoulder.
Pepper: Hey honey, she murmurs. I'm so happy to see you.
Peter: Me too, Peter whispers.
Melissa: Wish I could, but I can't stay away for too long. I wasn't supposed to be the one dropping him off in the first place, but I wanted to say goodbye.
Peter: I'll visit, he says hoarsely.
Melissa: You're always welcome, Melissa murmurs. But you don't have to. You have a new home. Don't feel guilty if we drop off your radar. That's how it's supposed to go.
Pepper: You'll have to let us know if you want anything different, Pepper says as she glances around. Tony and I just went with our gut feeling. You can put something in that picture frame. That poster used to be in Tony's workshop. Oh, and the magnet with the picture of Iron Man on it was Tony's doing, of course. You can throw it out.
Peter: It's a little scary, Peter admits.
Pepper: Yes. For us, too, Pepper assures him. New things are always scary. But we're also very excited.
Peter: *opens his mouth, then closes it again, looking torn.*
Pepper: You don't have to be excited, too, Pepper carefully says. I just wanted you to know how we feel."
25,23007160,Pepper,Peter,"Pepper: you okay, honey?
Peter: It’s a little scary.
Pepper: Yes. For us, too. New things are always scary. But we’re also very excited.
Peter: *opens his mouth, then closes it again, looking torn.*
Pepper: You don’t have to be excited, too. I just wanted you to know how we feel.
Peter: I’m sorry. I’m bumming you out. I was supposed to be happy.
Pepper: You’re not supposed to be anything, Peter. You’re moving into a new situation and it makes you think about everything you’ve lost. That’s normal.
Peter: *turns to her and leans in for another hug.* Thank you. You get me.
Tony: How are we doing?
Pepper: Just fine.
Tony: *looks eager to get in on the hug, spreading his arms wide and wrapping them around both of them.* My family.
Pepper: *chuckles a little.*
Tony: *drops a kiss into Peter's hair.* It’s okay, Pete. We know it’s a lot all at once. *leans back a little to catch a glance at Peter’s face.* Do you want a moment alone?
Peter: *immediately shakes his head.*
Pepper: Will you stay with him a little? *asks Tony.* I’ll go down and see what’s going on for dinner. Any requests, Peter?
Peter: *shakes his head, wiping his eyes.*
Pepper: *gives him a final kiss on the forehead before leaving the room.*
Tony: *lightly squeezes Peter’s shoulder.* Want me to help you with that bag, or would you rather do that yourself?
Peter: *slowly moves to his bag that has been placed on his bed, and pulls the zipper down.* Things are different when you’re in the Spider-Man suit, aren’t they?
Tony: I get that. Hey, just because we know you are Spider-Man doesn’t mean you suddenly have to start talking your head off, all right?
Peter: *clutches the mask a little tighter.* It’s safe.
Tony: I get that. Hey, just because we know you are Spider-Man doesn’t mean you suddenly have to start talking your head off, all right?
Peter: *turns and lies down on the mattress on his back, looking up at Tony.* Of everything I might possibly talk about, most of it is stuff I either couldn’t talk about or didn’t want to talk about. I got tired of the questions. Stuff like ‘how are you feeling today?’ or ‘where were you last night?’. So I stopped talking. And, I don’t know… Life became a lot easier, so I kept it up. No one has ever known about Spider-Man. No one.
Tony: Not even your parents, or you uncle and aunt?
Peter: *shakes his head.* Got bit after my parents died.
Tony: I’m sorry, bit?
Peter: Long story.
Tony: That’s okay. All in good time. How would you like it if we made you a new suit?
Peter: *looks up eagerly at that.*
Tony: I’ll take that as a ‘yes’. It’ll take a while, so don’t expect it to be done in one week!
Peter: We have time.
Tony: Yes, we do. Want to start straight away?"
26,23007160,Tony,Peter,"Tony: “We have time,” Peter says with a soft smile.
Peter: “Yes, we do. Want to start straight away?”
Tony: They make their way down to the workshop, where Peter gets to work on something that definitely piques Tony’s interest: his web fluid. Tony leaves his own project on his desk, instead sitting next to Peter’s worktable with his head leaning in his hands, closely monitoring the process. The scrutiny seems to make Peter a little shy, but the kid keeps up his work anyway.
Tony: “Pepper and I figured you shouldn’t go out patrolling again until this new suit, with all its safety protocols, is up and running. Okay?”
Peter: “Okay,” Peter replies easily as he mucks about with the chemical substances.
Tony: “Also, you have school, homework, dinner, bedtime… Where does Spider-Man fit in?”
Peter: “Depends on homework.”
Tony: “Fair enough. So, no Spider-Manning until the homework is done, is that your suggestion?”
Peter: “Yeah, okay,” Peter replies easily.
Tony: “And we’ll have to set a curfew. I have all your data; I know you go out in the middle of the night from time to time.”
Peter: “I don’t really like to do that,” Peter mutters. “But you know, in group homes they keep a really close tab on you. Sometimes it’s the only way I get to go out.”
Tony: “Well, I definitely don’t think that’s a good idea. How does ‘back inside at 11 p.m.’ sound?”
Peter: “Fine,” Peter says.
Tony: “I thought you were going to fight me hand and tooth on this.”
Peter: Peter just shakes his head.
Tony: “You know you can, right? If there’s anything you don’t agree with, or anything you want differently, you can talk to us about it.”
Peter: A short silence. Then: “You buy the wrong peanut butter.”
Tony: Tony barks out a surprised laugh. “Yeah? What’s wrong with it?”
Peter: “Not crunchy.”
Tony: “You want crunchy?”
Peter: “Yup.”
Tony: “Consider it done.”
Wanda: The other Avengers greet Peter enthusiastically at dinner. Wanda even gets a hug in. “How are you?” She asks.
Peter: “Tired,” Peter murmurs.
Sam: “That’s normal,” Sam pipes up. “You’ve been experiencing a lot of emotions this week. That drains you.”
Tony: “Sam’s a therapist,” Tony informs Peter, and Peter immediately shoots Sam a wary look.
Sam: “Don’t worry,” Tony continues. “He’s the good kind.”
Sam: “It’s good to keep moving,” he tells Peter. “Steve and I always go for a run in the mornings, maybe you want to join us?”
Peter: Peter’s face lights up and he nods.
Tony: Tony had never imagined that everyone else would accept Peter so readily into their life. He doesn’t like to give Steve or Sam too much credit, but Peter’s mood seems a lot better the next day. He comes back from the run with a sweaty forehead but a wide smile.
Peter: “Shower?” He asks.
Tony: “Of course, funsy. You know where to find everything, right? You have about thirty minutes until you have to leave for school. Happy will drive you.”
Sam: The boy nods and disappears. Sam flops down in an armchair, leaning his head back and groaning. “Why did I ever suggest that? Now there’s two of them. You have any idea how fast they run?”
Steve: Steve chuckles.
Tony: “I have a rough estimate, yes,” Tony says, thinking of all the data he has collected on Spider-Man over the past months.
Steve: “They’re going to kill me,” Sam mutters.
Steve: “We were just messing around today,” Steve says. “He had fun, didn’t he? But we’ll run at a normal, human pace next time. Promise.”
Tony: “Thank you for letting him tag along,” Tony says. “Means a lot.”"
27,23007160,Sam,Steve,"Sam: They're going to kill me, *mutters*
Steve: We were just messing around today, *says* He had fun, didn't he? But we'll run at a normal, human pace next time. Promise.
Tony: Thank you for letting him tag along, *says* Means a lot.
Sam: He's a good kid.
Happy: You took a long time, *says* Tony *when Happy and Peter return late that afternoon.*
Happy: We went for cheesecake, *says* Happy.
Tony: Did you, now?
Happy: I figured I might as well get to know him.
Peter: *grins*, holding up two fingers.
Tony: What does that mean, you ate two whole cheesecakes?
Peter: *rolls his eyes*.
Happy: Two pieces, *says* Happy. And half of mine.
Tony: That was nice of you. Thank you, *tells him*.
Happy: *pats Peter on the back*. What can I say, I like this one.
Tony: Good job, kid, *says* Tony *when he passes through the kitchen*. You guys, note how he choose to make an Iron Man pizza, not a Captain America one.
Peter: No blue, *explains with a shrug*.
Natasha: You want to see if you can beat an AI in a game of chess?
Peter: No, *says* Peter.
Natasha: *chuckles*. Fair enough.
Natasha: You'll make a good spy one day, *Natasha says* which, coming from her, is practically a gold medal.
Peter: Awesome, *Peter says earnestly*.
Tony: Yeah?
Peter: *nods*. Everyone is nice.
Tony: They are, aren't they? Usually not to me. I guess you bring it out in people.
Peter: *smiles*, looking a little exasperated. You're nice, too.
Tony: *hums*, squeezing Peter's knee. Morning jog with Sam and Steve, Cheesecake with Happy, cooking with Bruce and Rhodey... Are you ready for every day from now on to be as weird as today was?
Peter: I'm ready."
28,23007160,Tony,Peter,"Tony: You’re nice, too.
Peter: Morning jog with Sam and Steve, Cheesecake with Happy, cooking with Bruce and Rhodey… Are you ready for every day from now on to be as weird as today was?
Tony: I’m ready.
Peter: Are you nervous?
Tony: Yeah. Is that weird?
Peter: No, I’m pretty sure it’s normal. In fact, I believe Happy’s main job is to keep you from secretly sneaking out of a window and taking off.
Tony: Not a bad idea, funsy.
Peter: Well, at least wait until I’ve left the room before you bail, okay? Or Pepper’s gonna blame me.
Tony: How do I look?
Peter: Totally lame.
Tony: Screw you, underoos.
Peter: You’re messing up your nicknames.
Tony: Just thinking about you.
Peter: Why?
Tony: Because I love you.
Peter: Save it for Pepper, dude.
Tony: There’s enough love to go around.
Happy: For me, too?
Tony: There he is! The most irresponsible best man ever. I was about to jump out a window, I’ll have you know. Peter had to tackle me.
Happy: Well done, Peter.
Tony: That lady is permanently impatient. She’s like the direct antithesis of Pepper.
Peter: I like her.
Tony: You like everyone.
Happy: You’re blabbering.
Peter: He’s nervous.
Happy: Let’s get going. Rhodey didn’t get ordained for nothing."

Peter: *patting Tony on the arm* He's nervous.
Happy: Let's get going. Rhodey didn't get ordained for nothing.

Pepper: *wearing a pretty, green dress* I don't want to spend all that money on something I'll only wear once.
Tony: They run a billion-dollar company.
Pepper: Actually, I run it, and I can wear whatever the hell I want thankyouverymuch.
Tony: *gives up*

Peter: Can we take a picture together? The three of us?
Tony: Yes, of course funsy, c'mere. Bruce - could you snap one? Someone hold my cake. How does my hair look?
Bruce: Totally lame.

Peter: *holds out the empty picture frame to Tony*
Tony: You want to hang that in your room?
Peter: Yes...?
Tony: I think it's awesome. I'm honored to be part of this little list.
Peter: Yeah. Don't die, okay?
Tony: Do you want me to stop being Iron-Man?
Peter: No. You have to help people. We both do. You didn't stop me from going out, because you get that.
Tony: And I'd prefer if you didn't die, either. Because I have plans for you.
Peter: I... have plans for you, too.
Tony: *chuckles*

Peter: I'm gonna show them to Pepper.
Tony: *turns back to his project*"
