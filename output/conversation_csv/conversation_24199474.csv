0,24199474,Vader,Officer,"Vader: Why are all the engineers tearing through the ships?
Officer: They are fixing the life support and shielding of the TIEs, my Lord.
Vader: The TIE-Fighters don't have deflector shielding.
Head Engineer: We are aware, my Lord. But there was this video explaining how to easily make some changes to the TIEs and I saw it fit to ensure we reduce our damages.
Vader: What video?
Head Engineer: *fetches a datapad and opens a video* Welcome to another episode of Scrap Hunting, the teenager in the video said."
1,24199474,Luke,Biggs,"Luke: Welcome to another episode of Scrap Hunting. *sips water* A couple weeks ago some sleemo commented that I’d never be able to improve any Imperial ships since I’m just Outer Rim trash.
Luke: And I suppose you did have a point that the things I fix won’t ever reach the level of an Imperial TIE because I wouldn’t build such trash in the first place.
Luke: So, to prove that I can do better, I sold a lot of speeders, ships and droids, repaired more terrible freighters than I can count, won several totally legal races and placed a couple of very fortunate bets in the palace of Jabba.
Luke: Anyway, the point is, I made a lot of money to buy a lot of trash.
Luke: So in today’s episode, I’m not only going to prove all you disbelievers wrong, I’m also going to drag the entire Tie-Fighter Program through the sarlacc pit. I’m Luke, the man recording is Biggs, my helper over there is HK-77 and this is Scrap Hunting.
Head Engineer: He proceeds to begin to completely overhaul the damaged TIE he bought with alarmingly low cost and high efficiency within a few hours and, frankly speaking, embarrasses me. Some of the things Luke does never occurred to me and it should have, I went to one of Coruscant’s best universities-
Vader: Either way, we are now making changes to our TIEs. I apologize for not having informed you before, my Lord, but I assumed you’d approve of our Fighters being the most advanced on the field.
Vader: You presumed correctly, Vader said. Finish outfitting the TIEs you already began taking apart. I will watch the video of this Luke and see what exactly he has to say about the military.
Head Engineer: Yes, Sir! I won’t disappoint you!
Luke: XLuke had not planned on becoming famous with a video titled Tuning up your TIE-Fighter to prove you’re better than the bastard currently running the TIE-Fighter Program for fun and profit. In fact, he had never expected any of his videos to gain the kind of following and attention they had even before that particular one. In all honesty, it had just started with him making a recording of how he fixed vaporators without taking them apart completely so his friend Biggs could do it as well. He’d just posted that on the net and kept going. First about droids, some more rambles about ships and a while back he’d finally been..."
2,24199474,Luke,Biggs,"Luke: C’mon, one last project before I leave for the Academy.
Biggs: Alright, where are we going to get a TIE, though?
Luke: TIE’s were not made to be repaired. How do I know? Because this is where the Empire would store the hyperdrive navigational systems, theft prevention protocols and life support, if the TIEs had any!
Luke: What kind of moron designs a ship that doesn’t have that?
Luke: I know, the Empire also made some pretty cool ships. I won’t lie, I’d kill to get my hands on the schematics on the Devastator, but the security of Kuat Drive Yards is too good.
Luke: Not that I’d ever attempt to get a better look on them.
Luke: Point is, they cut all these extra measures out to lose weight and mass produce these TIEs with the lowest costs possible."
3,24199474,Luke,Vader,"Luke: Point is, they cut all these extra measures out to lose weight and mass produce these TIEs with the lowest costs possible. However, even out here on Tatooine we’ve got ships with really small and efficient support systems, so I’ll dig through this mess down here and make some space for life support first. *points at the large box* All I need for that is in this box. I uploaded the schematics to my usual server. It’s free to download, but I’d be very thankful if you could leave me a tip because I am broke until I’ve gotten this project done.
Vader: *skims through the next hours as Luke works on taking the TIE's insides apart*
Luke: Not sure yet if I can get my hands on a hyperdrive that won’t blow up on me, but we’ll see. Theft prevention, however, I can work with.
Luke: Check this. *throws a hydrospanner at the outer shell of the TIE, causing alarms to blare*
Luke: Nailed it.
Luke: Oh, shit. Stop recording, Biggs, stop-
Biggs: Hello, fellow Hunters. I’m Biggs and unfortunately, I have to do today’s video by myself.
Biggs: I hope you’ll enjoy it despite the lack of our overly bright mechanic and resident murderbot. Don’t worry, I know you’re all not actually watching this for me.
Biggs: This short video is just an update on our current situation. First of all, we’re super happy to see that so many people enjoyed our newest video. The next parts will be uploaded as soon as we can get our hands on the items we need, which might take a while given that Luke has been grounded from working on the TIE for the foreseeable future. If you have any questions for him though, feel free to drop him a message @skyseekerpilot, he’s still got access to the holonet.
Biggs: We’re thinking of doing a Q&A in the near future to bridge the time between the actual next update. Feel free to send us any kind of question!"
4,24199474,Biggs,Vader,"Biggs: Written by yours truly, *set the flimsi aside* We’re thinking of doing a Q&A in the near future to bridge the time between the actual next update. Feel free to send us any kind of question! That being said, don’t miss us too much!
Vader: *almost found himself being disappointed* The youth had certainly talked a lot about unimportant things, it was clear that he was a mere aid to Luke. Perhaps contacting the boy about his ideas would be worth it.
Luke: I could get rid of the problem, *Luke replied* I guess I’ll just check the ‘net again.
Luke: *took out his datapad and began skimming his usual sites* He watched the video Biggs had uploaded and looked a little though all the comments they’d already gotten. Their channel had really blown up in the past days and a lot of people seemed quite eager about the possibility of a Q&A, already shooting off questions. Luke switched over to his page and saw a steady amount of questions and comments come in. A lot of them were rather personal, but one caught his attention.
Luke: *reading the message* Reading the message, Luke began to smile widely. Fighterfan had obviously sat down to do the proper math. Luke, admittedly, had only done some rough calculations but his result had been almost the same and he’d immediately began searching for solutions.
Luke: *wrote back, grinning like a madman* Easy, I add deflector shields and modify a hyperdrive of the Interio Class. ;)
Luke: *knowing that his holonet connection wasn’t exactly the best* So when he got a reply barely thirty minutes later, he knew that the other person must have replied immediately.
Fighterfan: The Interio Class hyperdrives are slow at best and do not work at all at worst. I take it you intend to break it down so far that it cannot actually do a hyperspace jump but still accelerates much faster than any other engine?
Twin Suns: Exactly!!! :D Should push the speed back up to 1,200 KPH despite the added weight! I’d also suggest changing the wings to bent-wing solar arrays, but I don’t have the materials for that right now :/
Fighterfan: While the flight controls were designed to be intuitive and easy to learn, very few people would be skilled enough to fly a ship with the modifications you are proposing.
Twin Suns: I could."
5,24199474,Luke,Vader,"Luke: I want to talk to you, *smirked*
skyseekerpilot: I could. :)
Vader: The boy certainly proved that he was bright and clever. *hadn't been sure what to expect of his conversation with Luke*
Luke: Welcome back to Scrap Hunting! *announced excitedly* As you can see, I have returned to the land of the living!
Biggs: He's still grounded, *said next to him* I'm just allowed to visit now.
Luke: Don't make fun of me. I was incredibly lonely. *rolled his eyes and lightheartedly punched his friend into his side*
Biggs: Sure, whatever you say. *smiled and messed up Luke's hair in return*
Luke: All the time. *replied seriously* I don't think this droid likes anyone but Luke and the mouse droid keeping the house clean.
Biggs: Maybe got lost in Aunt Beru's closet again, wouldn't be the first time. Alright, you do the next question.
Luke: Oh! It's every fifth note of my favorite song so it doesn't get taken down for copyright reason. I'll put a link in the description.
Luke: Tatooine, Outer Rim desert world. Do not recommend unless you can survive without a lot of water.
Biggs: Indeed, not the best place to raise your children. *nodded*
Luke: What could you possibly need the programming of an assassin droid for?
Luke: Didn't we say that before once?"
6,24199474,Luke,Biggs,"Luke: Didn’t we say that before once?
Biggs: No idea, you talk a lot when you’re working.
Luke: You love to hear me talk.
Luke: Well, I’m seventeen and Biggs is nineteen. I’ve been doing repairs on droids for as long as I can think. Speeders and ships are new additions.
Biggs: Same for me. You can’t grow up in the middle of nowhere running a moisture farm and not be at least a half-decent mechanic.
Biggs: Okay, next question: What was your favorite project so far? Hmm, I think I enjoyed ‘Hagekay vs Emmy with a viroblade’ the most. You?
Luke: The TIE-Fighter. Even if I wasn’t so sure about it at first. That reminds me! I don’t know how many of you have seen the bits of the conversation that aren’t private, but you should seriously check out Fighterfan @thatsaneatrick. The ship modifications he speaks of are the best and a couple of them will definitely end up in the TIE, credit given, of course. When we’re done with this video, I’ll go right back to replying to your thoughts about navigation systems because I totally agree-
Biggs: Alright, alright. Nerd out with your new best friend somewhere I don’t have to see it.
Luke: What are you? Five?
Luke: Compared to your mature six? Alright, next question-
Fighterfan @thatsaneatrick: Yes. TIEs are viewed as expendable, due to their cheap production costs, as are their pilots. The Empire prefers quantity over quality.
Fighterfan @thatsaneatrick: You are wrongly presuming that TIE-Fighter pilots have friends.
Fighterfan @thatsaneatrick: Yes. I was stuck in a briefing and couldn’t reply. You mustn’t worry. I do not have any friends, nor do I want them."
7,24199474,Fighterfan,thatsaneatrick,"Fighterfan @thatsaneatrick: Yes. I was stuck in a briefing and couldn’t reply. You mustn’t worry. I do not have any friends, nor do I want them.
Fighterfan @thatsaneatrick: You are too dependent on him, Luke. You do not need him.
Fighterfan @thatsaneatrick: I have also found our talks to be pleasant.
Fighterfan @thatsaneatrick: TIE Advanced x1
Fighterfan @thatsaneatrick: You wanted to ask me whether I am a TIE-Fighter pilot. I own a TIE Advanced x1
Fighterfan @thatsaneatrick: Give me a few hours.
Fighterfan @thatsaneatrick: I have sent you the plans we talked about. Have you ever considered signing up for the Imperial Academy?
Fighterfan @thatsaneatrick: I am able to get you a contract as civilian consultant. You’d be able to work from home.
Fighterfan @thatsaneatrick: If you give me your personal data, I’ll send you a contract."
8,24199474,Luke,HK-77,"Luke: Hello, everybody and welcome to another episode of Scrap Hunting! Today is a special compilation dedicated to @thatsaneattrick, who basically gave me an early birthday present. So, sit back and enjoy a compilation of the things we usually cut from our videos! I’m Luke, my helper today is HK-77 and shout out to Biggs who is currently studying a couple of planets away from me!
HK-77: *standing beside Luke, holding out various tools*
Luke: This was not designed to land, this ship was not designed to land, this ship was not designed to be functional, functional at all.
Biggs: Where did you hide my hydrospanner.
HK-77: I did no such thing, Biggs.
Biggs: *throws himself on HK-77*
Luke: We have to help Emmy.
Biggs: It’s so kriffing clumsy, like a baby.
Luke: A good mechanic?
Biggs: Then why is the TIE’s cockpit smoking?
Luke: I was just taking a look at the repulsorlift antigravity field- oh, kriff it’s burning.
Fighterfan: Have you thought about my job offer yet?
Twin Suns: Job offer? You were really serious about that? O.o
Fighterfan: Of course, did you not see the attachment I sent you?
Twin Suns: I never got a message with a job offer, so I thought you were joking!!! The only thing I got was a message by some guy pretending to be Vader. Didn’t even bother to open that, who knows what kind of virus I could have caught. -.-‘
Fighterfan: Someone pretended to be Lord Vader? Surely nobody would actually be so ignorant.
Twin Suns: Idk! I had to go on his holo page and it seemed legit but there’s no way the emperor’s slaver would ever message me I’m not that naive…Fighter? Are you still there?
Fighterfan: You would do well not to spread such rebel propaganda anywhere others could find them.
Twin Suns: Rebel propaganda??? Do you mean the ‘slaver’ thing? That’s not propaganda, that’s what Vader is. I know your serve in the Navy, and probably met him once or so. I can’t judge what kind of superior he might be, but his behavior is that of a slaver."
9,24199474,Ben,Luke,"Fighterfan @thatsaneatrick: What do you know of slavery, child?
Fighterfan @thatsaneatrick: What was your father's name?

Ben: We need to go, now. Where are your aunt and uncle?
Luke: Aunt Beru went into the city and Uncle Owen is out working on the vaporators, *replied slowly*"
10,24199474,Ben,Luke,"Ben: We need to go, now. Where are your aunt and uncle?
Luke: Aunt Beru went into the city and Uncle Owen is out working on the vaporators.
Ben: Then there is no time to get them. We must hurry.
Luke: Ben, what's going on? Why are we running?
Ben: We need to go before he's here-
Vader: Kenobi. I have finally found you.
Kenobi: So you have, Darth.
Luke: What is going on!?
Vader: You have been deceived all your life, young one. Kenobi stole you from me, kept you hidden so you wouldn't inherit your birthright.
Luke: My birthright. I'm sorry, what are you even talking about.
Ben: Your father was a good man. And you ruined him.
Vader: You left me to burn! You said you loved me and you left me behind for Sidious to take and remake as he wanted. You took my son from me and let him grow up on the Force-forsaken planet! You stole years from me, months of being unaware of who I was talking to.
Luke: Father?"
