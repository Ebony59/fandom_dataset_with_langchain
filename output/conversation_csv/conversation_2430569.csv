0,2430569,Sirius,Remus,"Sirius: Merlin's Beard. Who are you, and what have you done with our Moony? James rises to block Remus from stepping into their compartment, waving his wand threateningly in front of him. Remus laughs and bats it away. Honestly, mate. You look different.
Remus: Shut up. Let me in.

Sirius: Prongs.
James: Mmph?
Sirius: James!
James: What?
Sirius: Moony is hot.
James: Good for him.
Sirius: Like, really hot.
James: Sirius.
Sirius: Yes. Seriously hot.
James: Get out of my bed.

Sirius: You don't understand.
James: You have a raging boner for Remus. We are all aware.
Sirius: Prongs!
James: Why don't you tell him?
Sirius: I can't just tell him. You don't just tell people things like that. Well, maybe people. Not Moony. I need a plan.
James: Can't it wait?
Sirius: No! Prongs! Have you seen how hot he is? Someone is going to snatch him up. Come right along and just snatch him up in their filthy, unworthy claws, all for themselves.
James: I'm sure-
Sirius: If it were Evans, I'd help you.
James: You never-
Sirius: You're a lost cause by now. Can we focus on me? I think my problem is a little more urgent than yours. Evans will still be available to reject you in heart breaking and tragic ways all year. Actually. You are a lost cause.
James: So you've said.
Sirius: Why am I asking you for help? No. You are useless to me.
James: Right, thanks.
Sirius: As is Wormtail. Ah, my pathetic comrades, I must go alone in my pursuit for- OW!
James: Get out.

Sirius: Sirius needs a plan. A special plan. Not his usual Marauder genius, but a plan that will appeal to Remus. That he will appreciate. It is with this in mind, that he finds himself in the library during the first week of term. Feeling like a proper swot as he digs through the Muggle Literature section, because he knows Remus has a fondness for Muggle Literature. He also has a fair knowledge of Remus' favourites. By the end of the day the dorm is covered in fragments of Eliot's 'The Love Song of J Alfred Prufrock”. Handwritten on torn pieces of parchment, the notes begin on Remus bed, and form a trail around the dorm, ending at Sirius..."
1,2430569,Remus,Sirius,"Remus: “This sticking charm is going to take days to lift.” Remus is frowning as he tries to peel the first note from one of the legs of his bed. Frowning is not the response Sirius was seeking. Frowning is Not Good. “Really, Sirius.”
Sirius: He sulks for a full evening, before accepting Plan 1 as a Failure, and moving on.
James: “No offence, chaps, but there is no way I am kissing any of you shirtlifters.”
Peter: “I'm with Pete on this one.”
James: “Sirius!”
Remus: “Whoever is responsible for this-” “Sirius.” “Padfoot.” “- I am going to pretend I haven't seen it, and by the time I am back from the shower, it will be all gone.” “But-” “No. No, no. I don't want excuses. I just want it gone.”
Sirius: Sirius is beginning to empathise with James, and that is Truly Tragic.
Remus: “What are you doing?”
Sirius: “Nothing.”
Remus: “For some reason, I highly doubt that.”
Sirius: “You wound me! There is no trust in this relationship, my dear Moonykins.”
Remus: “Mhm. May I have my jumper back?”
Sirius: “No. It's warm and comfy.”
Remus: “I am aware. That is precisely why I am so fond of it myself, funnily enough.”
Remus: “Don't you want me to be warm and comfy, too?”
Remus: “Off my bed then.”
Sirius: “No.”
Remus: “I will lie on you.”
Sirius: “I shan't be moved.”
Remus: “Sirius, please.”
Sirius: The strain in Remus' voice has Sirius on his feet in seconds, instantly transitioning from playful to concerned. He steps closer, palm to Remus' forehead, eyes crinkled at the side with worry. “Are you okay?”
Remus: “I'm fine. Just tired.”
Sirius: “Pre moon?”
Remus: “Pre moon.”
Sirius: “Do you want your jumper?” Sirius asks; soft, quiet.
Remus: “No. It's okay. You can wear it.”"
2,2430569,Sirius,Remus,"Sirius: Do you want your jumper?
Remus: No. It's okay. You can wear it.
Sirius: Hi.
Remus: Hey.
Sirius: Just brought you some supplies.
Remus: You're a life saver, Sirius.
Sirius: How're you feeling?
Remus: Tired, mostly. Not too much damage this time. What about you guys? Did I-
Sirius: No, no. All injury free.
Remus: Oh. Good.
Sirius: You look tired as well.
Remus: I haven't had a decent run in ages. It was absolutely fantastic!
Sirius: I'm glad you enjoyed yourself.
Remus: Yeah. Oh, you've got a little-
Sirius: *licks the smudge of chocolate from the corner of Remus' mouth*
Remus: You really are a dog."
3,2430569,Sirius,Remus,"Sirius: I'm glad you enjoyed yourself. *leans forward and licks the smudge of chocolate from the corner of Remus' mouth*
Remus: You really are a dog.
Sirius: *gapes* Is Moony that oblivious?
Sirius: It is official. *drops onto the couch* I am joining you in the legion of lost causes.
Peter: Oomph.
James: Geroff.
Sirius: I have mocked you all these years, but I have never truly understood the bitter sting of rejection.
Sirius: Oi, Moony.
Remus: Yes?
Sirius: *digs his elbow into James' stomach* Sirius is completely and irrevocably smitten with you and would probably quite like to snog your face, among other gooey things, like holding your hand and feeding you chocolate.
Remus: Oh. Is that all, then?
Sirius: *head falls back* Betrayal!
Remus: Sirius?
Sirius: *cracks open an eye* Yeah?
Remus: Word in the dorm?
Sirius: *self-conscious* This is it. This is The End.
Remus: *crosses the room, cups Sirius' cheek, and kisses him* That means I like you, too.
Sirius: I'm not sure I caught that. Best do it again.
Remus: *moves back to look at Sirius* Why didn't you just tell me yourself?
Sirius: Because, my good Moony, you don't just come out with these kinds of things!
Remus: Oh? What do you do, then?
Sirius: *scowls* What about the poetry? Or the mistletoe? The wearing your clothes? Merlin, Remus, I licked your face.
Remus: Oh. Ohh. Some of those make a lot more sense now.
Sirius: But you are oblivious and hopeless and awful at picking up on things.
Remus: *laughs*"
4,2430569,Sirius,Remus,"Sirius: You do, then? Sirius scowls, feeling foolish because none of his plans worked.
Remus: What about the poetry? Or the mistletoe? The wearing your clothes? Merlin, Remus, I licked your face.
Sirius: Oh. Ohh. Some of those make a lot more sense now.
Remus: But you are oblivious and hopeless and awful at picking up on things.
Sirius: Well, in my defence, those were all the kinds of things you would usually do, anyway.
Sirius: Hopeless, he repeats, muffled by Remus' skin, and Remus laughs against his hair."
