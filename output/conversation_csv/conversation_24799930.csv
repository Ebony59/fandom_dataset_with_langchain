Hermione: How could she have missed this? Had it always been there and she never noticed, or had someone dosed her with a love potion? *she went to the library*

Fred/George/Angelina/Lee: No engagement between the characters."
1,24799930,Theo,Blaise,"Theo: I don't know what that was about, but we both know you don't like those things. So what in Merlin's name is going on in your head right now?
Blaise: I-I thought you-?
Theo: Let me stop right there, idiot. I only want what you want. You're my boyfriend Theo, and I'm hoping to keep you for a long time. I know what makes you uncomfortable, and I get it. No need to force anything on my account.
Blaise: *huffs but pulls him closer*

Lavender: Ronnikins? Really? She could smack herself.
Lavender: That wasn't her! She knew that, her friends knew that! But she let herself get lost in the crazy feelings of her first crush, her first real relationship."
2,24799930,Lavender,Ronnikins,"Lavender: Ronnikins? Really? She could smack herself. That wasnâ€™t her! She knew that, her friends knew that! But she let herself get lost in the crazy feelings of her first crush, her first real relationship. She could admit to herself how wholly sheâ€™d merged herself to him after heâ€™d dumped her. She got it, didnâ€™t hold it against him. Hindsight was 20-20 and all that. Sheâ€™d been incredibly annoying. But, who could blame her? Sheâ€™s been ecstatic to finally have a boyfriend, one sheâ€™d had an eye on for awhile no less! But now at least she could laugh at herself and take the gentle teasing of her friends. Padma was especially eager to rub it in. Giggling to herself at Won-Won and staying up late with Lavender to talk and jest with her about it and more. Lavender didnâ€™t know what had happened there, they were good friends before she started dating, but after getting dumped suddenly Padma was always at her side, casually touching her and talking to her. She didnâ€™t seem to know what she was doing but Lavender was slowly losing her mind. Padma had been sympathetic to her breakup, but wouldnâ€™t let Lavender wallow in it. Often there to pull her back out of her shell and talking about the latest gossip sheâ€™d heard to distract her whenever her ex walked by. It took six months of constant contact. Six months of late nights together; staying up late chatting only to crash in each otherâ€™s beds, cuddling close to the other girl. Six months of partnering together in every class project. Six months of sharing each otherâ€™s clothes and doing each otherâ€™s makeup. Six months, before finally Lavender couldnâ€™t take it anymore. *Pulling Padma into an alcove and kissing her flat on the mouth probably wasnâ€™t the best idea sheâ€™d come up with. But her reaction wasnâ€™t entirely expected.* Took you long enough! Lavender just had to kiss the smug look off her face after that remark.

Remus: Remus didnâ€™t really know what Nymphadora saw in him. He was much older, covered in scars, and had a furry little problem that scared everyone else away that had looked past the first two. But still sheâ€™d persisted. And he couldnâ€™t be happier now. She never shied away from his affection, no flinch when his eyes glowed with a golden sheen in his happiness. She never hesitated in kissing him at every opportunity and when she hugged him she never avoided his scars. When they cuddled together under a blanket and watched movies she was always up in his space and draped all over him at every opportunity. Closer to full moons when his otherness was near the surface, she wasnâ€™t turned off when he ate rare or bloody meat more often. When he flashed sharp fangs occasionally without meaning to her only reaction was to growl teasingly and ruffle his hair. When sheâ€™d gotten pregnant, and heâ€™d gotten over his panic, she was understanding of his increased affection and protectiveness. She only looked amused when he started to â€œnestâ€� and created comfy pillow/blanket areas in different places around the house. Really, he had no clue how she was so understanding, so accepting. But he counted his blessings everyday and made sure to show her how much he cherished that.

Fleur: Fleur had been incredibly lucky when she found Bill. Not even her own family understood when she had tried to put her feelings into words for them. But Bill just got her. Everyone assumes that because she was a Veela sheâ€™d naturally be very flirty and fall in and out of love easily. And she had learned how to fake exactly such a thing so well it fooled even her parents. But two..."
