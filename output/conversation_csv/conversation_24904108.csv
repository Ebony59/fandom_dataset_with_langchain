0,24904108,Ron,Harry,"Ron: It's not much, but it's home.
Harry: I think it's brilliant.

Mrs. Weasley: You'll have to come in and tell me more about your muggles, Arthur!
Arthur: I've certainly got something to write down on, I'd love to learn everything you know. What is the function of a rubber duck, really?
Harry: Oh, I didn't explain that, did I? Well -
Mrs. Weasley: Let the boy see where he'll be sleeping, Arthur!
Harry: I'll be back, Mr. Weasley, sorry -
Arthur: No worries, Harry. Go on and see what Molly's got for you. I'll be here.

George: Yeah, I think my ears are bleeding.
Harry: *freezes on the stairs to hear some loud, what sort of sounds like punk music, honestly - emanating from Ginny's bedroom.*

Mrs. Weasley: Well now Harry, here's your bed.
Harry: Thanks Mrs. Weasley. I, I love it. This is fine, all, well, amazing, actually."
1,24904108,Harry,Mrs Weasley,"Harry: I want to talk to you. *puts down his case and flings himself into her for a hug* Thanks Mrs Weasley. I, I love it. This is fine, all, well, amazing, actually. *smiles and flushes* I'll get my trunk out of the way, sorry -
Mrs Weasley: It's fine, dear. *soothes him* Well I'll let you two get settled and I'll go down and make us an enormous brunch, how does that sound? How do you like your kippers, Harry?
Harry: Oh, erm, any way you cook them, Mrs Weasley, thanks. *sits down on the bed, hand curled round the foot of it as if to anchor himself* Thanks very much.
Mrs Weasley: You're very welcome, dear. I'll call up to you when food is ready. Do show Harry the amenities, Ron. *blows a kiss to them as she leaves*
Ron: Sorry about this, I know it's small.
Harry: It's great. I used to sleep in a cupboard, so this is incredible.
Ron: *breathing hard* Hang on, you WHAT?
Harry: Yeah, erm, the Dursleys had me sleep under the stairs until this year. I've got a bedroom now, but it wasn't that bad to kip in the cupboard, just was small. Actually kind of warm, though. I mean, there were some spiders that got into my socks -
Ron: *balled both of his fists and his skin bypasses red and goes maroon alarmingly fast* THOSE BLOODY ROTTERS FORCED YOU TO SLEEP IN A CUPBOARD UNDER THE STAIRS FOR TEN YEARS?!?"
2,24904108,Ron,Harry,"Ron: Ssh, Ron, it's okay, mate. *Harry's voice cracks.* I've got a room now, like I said, and sure they didn't feed me much this summer, but -
Ron: Hold - no, come on, Mum said you look thin, and she's going to get you food...oh god, they're, they really were starving you, weren't they Harry?
Ron: The Dursleys... they've been keeping Harry stuck under the stairs. For YEARS.
Fred: Oi Ronnie, Ickle Ronnykins, heardja shouting. Think Mum is going to let us downstairs for food if you keep doing that?
George: What's up, Ron, Harry?
Ron: Bloody hell, that isn't right.
Fred: No, it isn't."
3,24904108,Fred,Harry,"Fred: Yeah Harry you're so much trouble.
George: Asking nicely for what you want, what an outrage.
Fred: Don't worry about it.
Mrs Weasley: I think we've even got a bit left, aha!
Mrs Weasley: There you are, Harry dear. Now eat up; we have to get to Diagon Alley for books and that, you've got your letters come here this morning.
Mr Weasley: Dumbledore sent yours along as well, Harry.
Ron: Errol.
Percy: Errol.
Fred: Brilliant, actually, there's probably some reason ickle Ronnykins smothers his sausages.
George: Alright, Freddie, don't kill the children.
George: Least, not if you don't take out Perce too.
Fred: Right then, what'd bird brain bring?
Ginny: Oi c'mon don't talk about Errol -
Percy: Don't you mean yourself there, Fred?
Fred: Oh, hah, that's amazing, I'm rolling!
Fred: You know what, if you can't take a joke -
Percy: Really, well maybe you should slow down a minute, don't want you to hurt yourself.
Molly: Boys!
Molly: Er, right. Boys that's wrong, don't say things of that sort to each other, let"
4,24904108,Harry,Snape,"Ron: Yeah, which means no one's going to believe it if Harry tells on him, so it's better Harry gets his own back himself and loses a couple House points for it. You don't want Snape to get on Harry like he does Neville, do you?
Hermione: He's our teacher, Ronald!
Ron: Yeah, which means no one's going to believe it if Harry tells on him, so it's better Harry gets his own back himself and loses a couple House points for it. You don't want Snape to get on Harry like he does Neville, do you?
Fred: Well if Harry had only spoken clearly -
George: You shut that shite up, Percy, he's never used Floo Powder before!
George: Oh god, Hermione I'm sorry, I was talking about Harry's family, the Dursleys. I never meant -
Fred: Way to cock that right up, George.
Ron: Harry came with us here, but he got lost using Floo Powder, so everyone's a bit upset...
George: And Perce is bloody standing there like he's never done a stupid thing in his life, when it's not even Harry's fault he said the wrong thing!
Hermione: You're forgiven. Hello, Ron. And you were talking about Harry's aunt and uncle, weren't you?
George: Then I agree with you, they're ghastly. But the most pressing thing is finding Harry. I thought the only problem having him to stay would be using your flying car, she adds whilst falling into step with the whole family, receiving greetings from Mr and Mrs and Ginny. - clearly I was wrong."
5,24904108,Hermione,Dursleys,"Hermione: We can't have the Dursleys' car explode with or without them inside, not without any cause behind it. What reason to have their car explode?
Fred: No reason except for them all being a collection of absolutely grody wankstains.
Hermione: But that would likely kill them, and you don't want to be responsible for that, do you?
Ron: Hermione, I can't ever stop Fred 'n George. But, I think whatever we do to the Dursleys, they should know what happened, like. Haven't you got one of your mad inventions that can do summing to Harry's cousin, like how Hagrid tried to turn him into a pig last year?
Hermione: *gasps* Say something!
Ron: If you do something magical to the cousin, his parents will wig right out.
Fred: *devilish grin*
George: *devilish grin*
Hermione: *beams* Hullo Hermione, Harry! *flies at him for a hug* So wonderful to see you.
Harry: You too, *smile slips a little* Though I'm really sorry about not answering any of your letters, I heard you sent loads.
Hermione: No worries, *sniffs* I'm just so glad you're here, Ron told me he was going to come rescue you.
George: - in a way that was bloody wicked if I say so myself, *agreement from Fred and a glower from Mrs Weasley*
Fred: ... Mum's still sore about it, but I think deep down she approves, *loud whisper*
George: In your dreams, Fred."
6,24904108,Ron,Hermione,"Ron: Are you really going to find a spell to make everything Harry's cousin eats taste like it's been in the bin?
Hermione: Because most muggles would chuck something, and if it keeps happening, they'll just send him to the doctor.
Fred: How much is 'a lot', Hermione?
Hermione: Hundred pounds, at least. Erm, never mind.
Ron: Don't be a downer, Ronnie, we'll keep a watch on Harry!
Harry: ...what about me?
Fred: Say Harry, if your cousin found a sack of lollies and first one tasted like crup shite, would he keep eating them til he found one that tasted better, or would he toss out the entire sack?
Harry: I actually think he'd keep right on eating.
Ginny: *looks up from the book she's been standing off and scribbling in*
Mrs. Weasley: Come on, boys, enough of that, please, you've got to get through onto the platform so you don't miss the train! Stick with your brothers, Ginny dear.
Mr. Weasley: Here Ginny, we'll go with you in. Why don't we, Molly? It's her first year. You and Ron are next after us, alright Harry?
Harry: Okay, Mr Weasley."
7,24904108,Harry,Hermione,"Harry: No one is particularly interested in Harry's muggle woes for the first few weeks of school; after the hubbub about the flying car and the blocked up platform dies down, first time Harry sees Hagrid at school is when Ron is puking slugs, and the biggest order of the day is how hard they ought to punch Malfoy or otherwise harm him for calling Hermione a mudblood. *Harry looks up at her and squeezes her hand briefly.* About that, I - I'm really sorry.
Hermione: It's - not your fault, Harry. *Hermione's eyes are full of compassion and horror at the little Harry just voiced about his family.*
Ron: Blimey, I never thought about the other way round, Ron whispers, fist clenching around his fork. Wonder if it's anything like what happened for Seamus when his dad found out his mum had magic?
Harry: I don't think it's like what happened to Seamus, he swallows. Don't think it's like what anyone has, really. I dunno, Hermione, I used to get things chucked at me and had myself locked under the stairs or whatever. They don't call me anything though. Not even my name, really. It's just 'Hey you, boy! Hey you!' so. Nothing near the crap Malfoy talked to you, though.
Hermione: And what you deal with, it's just as bad, I think. Your aunt and uncle, they really are so awful. *She chokes a little on the words as Fred and George nod vigorously. Even Percy looks pale, and for once he doesn't have a clue what to say. Ron just mumbles about pounding the piss out of them one day.*
Harry: At least I'm here with all of you, he offers at last, pushing food around his plate before dessert appears on the glimmering plates and he instantly stuffs some with a pleased little sigh. This treacle is really good! Here, Hermione, have some. He offers the rest of it. Even a little something sweet brightens a dark day, some of the Weasleys murmur. It's something their mum has said at times, mostly when she felt one of her children needed a hug, or a kiss on the cheek and a favourite flavour of biscuit. But Harry is not to know that, he is simply, somehow, content with his lot. It's incredible, downright impressive, and Ron makes the decision to get more people into his best mate's corner. Harry doesn't deserve to be or feel alone against the Dursleys, 'specially with an attitude like the one he's got. He's going to do something about it."
8,24904108,Fred,George,"Fred: Harry's got to stay in there overnight, d'you think we -
George: ... should get out the word on what's been happening to him, like this being an extension of the shite he deals with all summer? Good thinking, *slaps Ron on the shoulder*. His younger brother blinks.
Fred: Wait, I -
George: You believe the thought in that? Being mates with Hermione here must be rubbing off on you, *rubs Hermione's bushy hair* and she flushes a little in surprise and pleasure. We really ought to go to supper, though, if the professors catch us out here -
McGonagall: Mr Weasley, Mr Weasley. I might have known the two of you would dawdle. And what's this?
George: What's what, Professor? Such elaborate innocence on both faces. We've just been on a walk after visiting Harry in the hospital wing.
Fred: Heading to the Great Hall right now, *A cocked eyebrow*. ...And as for Mr Weasley and Miss Granger?
McGonagall: Erm -
George: Well they were with us, Professor, see, but we told them they had better get on back ahead, really, *George shoos Ron and Hermione behind him* as he and Fred walk in-step, Fred's hand on Hermione's shoulder, hidden by his bag and robes as he attempts to shove her, and George, Ron - into an alcove so they can escape for the hall and not have any House Points taken.
Hermione: Ron and I went to see Harry as well, Professor, she says. We snuck in with the rest of the quidditch team. I'm sorry we stayed way too long, didn't we Ron? She looks back at and beckons to him. He shakes his head, skin almost looking green from the extent of his nerves. Not only has he been caught out, but with Fred and George covering for them he's sure that he and Hermione are going to get into a ton more trouble. But George shoves him out next to her with a tiny smile, and Ron could thump him. Erm...yeah. We're sorry, Professor McGonagall, he tries, pulling his lips to the side and looking down at her feet and then slowly up, trying to stay contrite.
McGonagall: Well. You were visiting your friend. Harry is lucky to have you, she says, and opens her mouth perhaps to tell them not to stay out wandering the halls late again, or set them off to supper, or maybe to take some points -
Ron: Not lucky enough, Ron blurts out. Harry isn't, I mean. We need to get him some supper, a lot of supper. Fred and George stare at each other and understand what Ron means, their hands dropping to and resting on his shoulders.
Hermione: Ronald!
McGonagall: *no response*"
9,24904108,Ron,Harry,"Ron: Not lucky enough. Harry isn't, I mean. We need to get him some supper, a lot of supper.
Hermione: Ronald!
McGonagall: And why is that, Mr Weasley?
Ron: Because - Because, the way he got to come to ours this summer, the only way was me an' Fred an' George had to break him out of his aunt and uncle's house!
Fred: It's true, Professor. Those - people were starving him.
George: They put bars on his bloody - sorry - blooming window. And they've been awful to him, yelling all the time. He - Harry told us.
Ron: I dunno if they've - hit him, or anything, but the bludger thing, it's bad as what he gets at theirs and that shouldn't happen to him!
McGonagall: Let us go to my office, please - I will get your food, and Harry's.
Fred: Like those new curtains, Professor. Snazzy.
McGonagall: Thank you, Mr Weasley. Please, have a seat, all of you.
George: Still working on proper posture, Professor?
McGonagall: It never hurts to keep up the practice, Mr Weasley."
10,24904108,George,McGonagall,"George: Still working on proper posture, Professor?
McGonagall: It never hurts to keep up the practise, Mr Weasley.
Ron: We've gotta do something for Harry, Professor!
McGonagall: I know, and I want to thank you for bringing this to my attention. Harry has not spoken thus to adults, I would imagine?
Ron: Er, no, I don't think so. I... don't really think he meant to tell us. I mean, he just kind of said something under his breath to me and then tried to act like it was okay, not a big deal, and... I just - don't understand, he's me best mate, and he never said anything about what bad stuff happens to him!
Hermione: It's like he didn't even realise how awful it was... he thinks it's worse to be called names than have things thrown at him by those - by people who are supposed to be his family...
McGonagall: It is a horrible side-effect to suffering abuse... for such sufferers not to admit, or recognise, the extent of such horrible occurrences.
Ron: Oh, Professor, what can we do? Should we go to Dumbledore?
McGonagall: Professor Dumbledore doesn't see a reason to place Harry anywhere else. However, as Mr Potter's Head of House, it is my duty to assist him myself, and rest assured that I shall do so, now this issue has come to my attention.
Fred: Um, y-yes, Professor?
McGonagall: I would like the pair of you to...use the particular means at your disposal to gather a feast for yourselves and Harry.
George: Understood, Professor.
Ron: Blimey, Hermione, I never expected that!
Hermione: What didn't you expect?"
11,24904108,Ron,Hermione,"Ron: Blimey, Hermione, I never expected that!
Hermione: What didn't you expect?
Ron: Just - her saying that about Dumbledore, that she's going to help Harry herself...any of it!
Hermione: *rolls her eyes in exasperated fondness* Oh, Ron.
Professor McGonagall: Contrary to popular belief, Mr Weasley, though I am a teacher I do, in fact, have a heart."
12,24904108,Ron,Twins,"Ron: All this? *open-mouthed*
Twins: From the kitchen, Ronny, don't you pay attention? *Both speak in unison*
Twins: Here you are Harry, we've got pumpkin juice -
Twins: Some kippers -
Twins: Salad, a bit of steak,
Twins: Ah! Rolls! With butter, can't forget that, mate -
Twins: Roast chicken and watercress, apparently
Twins: Some corn thing the cooks thought you'd like,
Twins: Oh and last but not least, treacle tart, which someone told us is your favourite. *A grin and another wink*
Twins: Eat up there, mate.
Harry: I - thank you, *his voice cracks* I... can't believe you've gotten all this for me.
Twins: Oh, of course we did, Harry.
Twins: It was Professor McGonagall who had the idea, actually. Well, she made the plan.
Harry: ... Really?
Professor McGonagall: Yes Potter, really, *the professor has come to stand by his bed after finishing her chat with Madam Pomfrey, and her eyes are warm as she looks at him, waving a wand to take up a swathe of linen to wrap around his arm, the matron going for a pillow to put beneath the boy's elbow. He is trying to mask his pain, but she sees it.* I am here for you, as your Head of House and your teacher, and as such I will do everything for you that I possibly can.
Harry: Thank you very much, Professor, *he says to her.*
Minerva McGonagall: *smiles into those bright green eyes that are those of another wonderful student she had, and though Harry's kindness is of her, the shy appreciation and modesty he possesses is all his own. Just as his messy dark hair and long nose reminds her of a brash loyal boy with a certain disregard for the rules...but Harry's staunchness is his. He may be his parents' child, but his character is his own.*"
