0,24984946,Cody,Waxer,"Cody: We have a Jedi too! A really real one from the Core, and he stayed to help even when the older ones left! *Cody's breath caught in his throat. In the corner of his eye, he could see Boil's hands faintly shaking.*
Waxer: It's okay, vod. I'm here, I'm alive, we're both alive. *One hand curled around his brother's back while the other sank into Boil's hair.*
Cody: Tion haar haran. *Whispered.*
Gears: Commander! *Gears looked relieved, pushing himself upright.*
Cody: How long did you last?
Cody: Another decade. *Cody answered, voice devoid of emotion. Not because he didn't have any, but it was easier to pretend they didn't exist for the moment.* But I may as well have died with Order Sixty-Six."
1,24984946,Waxer,Boil,"Waxer: Old ruins, but no inhabited settlements in the surrounding area.
Boil: Might be a city on the other side of the mountain, though. We saw light reflected on the cloud cover.
Cody: We'll make camp for the night. See if daylight doesn't bring us better options. Trapper, Jig, first watch with me.
Reddi: Whoa! Watch it, kid!
Waxer: Hey hey hey, easy there, don't hurt him. It's alright, we're friendlies, I promise. Can you speak Basic?
Child: Are you with the Melida? Or the Daan?
Waxer: The who?
Child: The- the Melida and the Daan. The adults. The ones fighting.
Waxer: Are you fighting too, little one?
Child: We want it to stop. We're the Young, we won't- we won't fight in their war for them, we just want it to stop.
Cody: We aren't allied with either of these Melida or Daan, little one. We serve the Republic."
2,24984946,Cody,Waxer,"Cody: We aren't allied with either of these Melida or Daan, little one. We serve the Republic. *carefully stepped closer, bringing the kid's attention squarely onto himself*
Child: Like the Jedi?
Cody: Yeah, kid. We have a Jedi we're supposed to be working under, but- we aren't sure where he is right now. *Waxer thankfully answered*
Child: We have a Jedi too! A really real one from the Core, and he stayed to help even when the older ones left!
Cody: *breath caught in his throat* Could you take us to this Jedi?
Child: Mm-hm! He's the one who told us to check the outer tunnels, 'cause he felt something - that's how we all know he's a real Jedi, even if he hasn't got a laser sword anymore.
Waxer: Definitely a Jedi. What's his name, then?
Child: Obi-wan Kenobi!
Cody: *ground fell out from beneath his feet*

Ginger-haired youth: Let me see if I've got this straight. You all think you've come back in time thirty years.
Waxer: Only twenty, for most of us.
Cody: *couldn't get over how young Obi-wan looked*"
3,24984946,Cody,Obi-wan,"Cody: No. *intense eyes flicked over to him* We want to help, because civilian children shouldnâ€™t be fighting their own families to try and stop a war. Because even if you werenâ€™t someone we knew and trusted, this isnâ€™t right. Anyone with an ounce of morality can understand that.
Obi-wan: *stared at him, before the youthâ€™s shoulders slumped oh so slightly* I wish my master had seen it that way.
Cody: Thatâ€™s osik, sir, *said flatly* Youâ€™re the one acting like a true Jedi, aiding those who need you. If your teacher couldnâ€™t see that, then heâ€™s an idiot.
Obi-wan: *blinked at him, repeatedly. His throat bobbed, and it looked like it took every ounce of his willpower not to start crying.* Thank you.
Cody: *gave him a nod* We obviously donâ€™t have anything of our own, sir, but perhaps in the morning we can do an inventory of resources, see where our skills will be best put to use.
Obi-wan: That- yes. That seems appropriate. *Regaining his composure, the youth straightened his shoulders.* We donâ€™t have much, but I wouldnâ€™t mind transferring some weaponry to you and your men from the younger children - use that as an excuse to keep them out of the fighting.
Cody: *another nod* Good idea. Weâ€™ll review the ranks as well, and perhaps set up some training routines.
Obi-wan: *agreed* Iâ€™ve got a datapad with some notes of what Iâ€™ve been trying to pass on-
Cody: In the morning, sir, *said, squinting at the dark bags under the boyâ€™s eyes.*"
4,24984946,Cody,Obi-wan,"Cody: You missed a spot.
Obi-wan: If you aren't going to be helpful, you're perfectly welcome to go wait elsewhere.
Cody: And leave you alone to dissolve into a nervous puddle?
Obi-wan: Vod'ika, this isn't anything more than the initial contact; no Senators or Ambassadors, just a handful of political aides talking about minor legalities.
Obi-wan: It's still laying the groundwork for more important negotiations later, and I don't want to look like someone who's spent the better part of a year living underground.
Cody: Ob'ika, whether they do or don't, your choices are your own. You have no reason to be afraid of them, or ashamed, or anything else.
Obi-wan: I wish... I wish it hadn't gone the way it did, though. I'm- not ashamed, exactly, but-
Cody: You regret.
Cody: And I regret it too, vod'ika - that you didn't have a better teacher, one who didn't insist there were only two options for you to choose between. But for what it's worth, I think you took the better road.
Cody: *rests his hands on Obi-wan's shoulders*
Obi-wan: *slumps against Cody, hands grasping at his back*
Cody: *hugs Obi-wan, one hand coming up to card through soft hair*
Unknown character: Senate ship arriving in ten, vod'e!"
5,24984946,Cody,Obi-wan,"Cody: Senate ship arriving in ten, vod'e!
Obi-wan: We'll be there.
Cody: You ready?
Obi-wan: Suppose I have to be.
Cody: Just for now. Just until the locals get their feet back under them.
Obi-wan: And then what?
Cody: *follows Obi-wan out of the room and down the hall*
Cody: *thinks to himself* Something must have happened Before, which let his general return to the Order, but would it happen again? Or had it already been thrown off by Cody and the others arriving, changing things? Would Obi-wan decide not to try and become a Jedi again, in which case would he stay? Would he travel elsewhere? Would he agree to the brothers coming too, or insist on being alone for a while to get his bearings?
Cody: *ignores the last possibility*
Cody: *outside of the old hotel, observing the crowd*
Cody: *thinks to himself* Tion'ad hukaat'kama, Cody could remember instructing them. Who's watching your back? Who do you trust to keep eyes on your blind spots? He regretted not being able to prevent civilian children from becoming soldiers - but they were alive to be soldiers.
Cody: *thinks to himself* Education and armor, self-defense, our tribe - our language and our leader, all help us survive.
Cody: Ni copaani slanar! Gedet'ye, Waxer-
Waxer: Mhi liniba traat'aliit, nu traatika.
Cody: *peers through the hotel's entrance and sees Waxer with a child*
Cody: We don't want to overwhelm the visitors, verd'ika, and you can be very overwhelming.
Waxer: *shrugs* She doesn't like being left behind, these days."
6,24984946,Cody,Waxer,"Cody: She doesn't like being left behind, these days.
Waxer: *offering a shrug*
Cody: Can't say I blame her. Everything set for the guests?
Waxer: 'Lek, vod. Rooms are ready, we've picked out who's going to play tour guide, and lunch will be good to go as soon as everyone's back.
Cody: *claps Waxer on the shoulder* Good work. Let's get this lot moving, then.
Cody: *parks himself at Obi-wan's shoulder* Good work. Let's get this lot moving, then.
Cody: *pulls on his bucket, the lights of a small spacecraft just lighting up the fog above them*
Cody: *parks himself at Obi-wan's shoulder* Good work. Let's get this lot moving, then.
Cody: *pulls on his bucket, the lights of a small spacecraft just lighting up the fog above them*
Cody: *counts three senatorial aides, two record clerks, six less finely dressed beings who were likely servants... and at the very back, a pair of hooded figures*
Cody: *briefly touches Obi-wan's back, reminding the youth of his presence*
Cody: *waves Waxer on and stays beside Obi-wan*
Obi-wan: *laughs, returning the hug*
Cody: *grins under his helmet*
Cody: You beat him once, you can do it again, sir.
Obi-wan: I certainly hope so, Cody. I certainly..."
7,24984946,Maul,Obi-wan,"Maul: You are an idiot. Do you have any idea how worried we've all been?!
Obi-wan: I know, I know, but I couldn't just leave. Besides, I've had help.
Shaak Ti: Just as we have heard of these, Loyal Ones, yes?
Cody: Yes, Master Jedi. That's the simplest translation.
Shaak Ti: And just how does a group of Mandalorians find themselves assisting children in a civil war on a small world of little significance, if I may ask?
Cody: It's a long story. But if you know anything about Mando culture, Master Jedi, you know we couldn't turn our backs on kids.
Maul: Master Ti and I know that better than most Jedi.
Obi-wan: How long have you known Maul?
Cody: We were crechemates. He came to the Temple a bit late - five standard years, I think - but we've been in the same circle of friends ever since.
Cody: It's something that's different. Your other self, the General - I knew what enemies were personal for him, the ones who'd been Jedi before they were Sith. But Maul- as far as I know, he'd only been a Sith.
Obi-wan: ...I can remember, the creche masters used to watch him, a lot more closely than anyone else. Like, they were worried about him.
Cody: Or about what he might do.
Shaak Ti: *knowing gaze*"
8,24984946,Cody,Master Mando,"Cody: Is there a name or rank I should address you by, Master Mando? *One dusky red hand held a bowl of stew close; the other offered a second his way.*
Master Ti: Just Cody, Master Jedi, *she answered, accepting the food.* Though you might hear some of my brothers slip up and refer to me as 'Commander'.
Cody: If it's 'just' Cody, then you are welcome to call me Ti. *He hummed, delicately stirring a wooden spoon through the stew.* I've heard of Mandalorian groups that never remove their helmets with company other than family present.
Cody: *snorted*, and took that opportunity to lift his own bucket. We're not that dedicated - just a bit blaster shy.
Master Ti: *nodded*, and proved her sneaky side by waiting until he'd taken a swallow of stew to speak up again. Do you have a brother called Alpha-17, Cody?
Cody: *His swallow went down the wrong way, and Cody coughed, long and hard. He wound up setting aside the bowl, and even taking off his helmet completely to avoid it falling to the ground. Master Ti smoothed a hand against the base of his neck as he bent over, making it suddenly easier to get air in again. Cody gave one more cough to clear his throat before straightening back up.* Alpha? *He croaked, rubbing a hand against his sternum.* When did you-?
Master Ti: Close to ten years ago, *Master Ti replied, smiling like a tooka that successfully found the prey it had been tracking.* He approached me on a mission, with Maul sitting on his hip. Apparently he'd stolen the child away from a Sith Lord in the making, but didn't have the means of bringing him to our Temple.
Cody: *A faint ringing started up in his ears, and Cody found himself grinning.* That explains it. Alpha came back, and probably landed almost on top of Maul the same way the 212th crashed in on Obi-wan. Except- ten years- he's been here much longer than us.
Cody: Do you know where he is?
Master Ti: No. But I receive comm messages every so often, so I know he's still alive.
Cody: *sat back with a huff.* Typical.
Master Ti: Wolffe and his Pack, on the other hand, never seem to be out of sight of my dear friend Plo Koon.
Cody: *The grin made a return appearance, even bigger than before.*"
9,24984946,Obi-wan,Cody,"Obi-wan: Padawan, *said quietly, yet somehow projecting his voice for the entire circle of brothers to hear.*
Cody: Master Jinn, *replied in an empty tone.*
Obi-wan: I still can't believe they wanted me to do it, *muttered, causing Cody to nearly choke on his drink.*
Cody: They what?
Obi-wan: Wanted me to be their Senate representative, *his little brother reiterated, handing the man a towel to wipe his face with.* Or Nield did, anyway. I don't think Cerasi had fully committed to the idea like him, and she backed off first when they saw the face I made.
Cody: Horror, or flat out disgust?
Obi-wan: Both. I mean, could you imagine me walking into the Senate rotunda dressed like this?
Cody: Well, I suppose you could set off a new high fashion trend.
Obi-wan: *gestured to his swamp-stained tunic and patched trousers.*
Cody: *joked* The two of them stared at each other for a long moment, before Obi-wan broke, and Cody quickly followed. Their laughter rang out from the rooftop they'd been having lunch on, and down below, several faces looked upward, wondering what was so funny.
Obi-wan: I want to see them get everything up and running, ori'vod. I can't- I don't think I can leave before seeing this all the way through. But then...
Cody: Time to move on?
Obi-wan: Yeah, *the youth replied, still looking upwards.*
Cody: Coruscant?
Obi-wan: *shook his head* No. As good as it was to see Maul, and hear about the others, I- I can't go back. *His voice broke a little, and Cody shifted over to wrap an arm around the boy's shoulders.*
Cody: Alright, vod'ika. We'll go wherever you want.
Obi-wan: *stiffened, and straightened up, taking himself out from under the man's arm.* You don't have to feel obligated to follow me, Cody, none of you do-
Cody: Ob'ika, *he interrupted.* Do you remember what I said when we first showed up here?
Obi-wan: *took a moment.* ...you wanted to help, because even if you didn't know who I was, it wasn't right for children to fight their own families in a war they wanted to stop.
Cody: That's right. And the war's over now - I don't doubt at least a few of the others will want to stay, to keep helping rebuild and put their blasters behind them. But as for me, I'm not about to let a kid who went from Temple life to an active warzone try to navigate this galaxy completely by himself."
10,24984946,Cody,Obi-wan,"Cody: And the war's over now - I don't doubt at least a few of the others will want to stay, to keep helping rebuild and put their blasters behind them. But as for me, I'm not about to let a kid who went from Temple life to an active warzone try to navigate this galaxy completely by himself. *knocked a couple of knuckles against Obi-wan's forehead* Not that I think you couldn't figure out some way to take care of yourself, but you don't have to. Not alone.
Obi-wan: *grinned at him* I'm starting to think you're too loyal for your own good.
Cody: *swallowed, and smiled back* Damn straight.

Cody: In case it slipped your mind, Master Jedi, *drawing Jinn's attention squarely onto himself* Obi-wan isn't your student anymore.
Jinn: *narrowed his eyes* That is why I am here, Mandalorian. To offer him the opportunity to renounce his mistake, and return with me to the Order.
Cody: *scoffed* Mistake. You're the one who left him - seems to me that's the mistake.
Jinn: *darkened expression* I am not inclined to argue with you, Mandalorian, but this is Jedi business.
Cody: *took another step forward* So unless you're going to start off with an apology for my little brother, you won't be speaking to him at all.
Jinn: *paused, and took a deep breath* Regardless. There is still a place for him, in the Jedi Order, should he be prepared to work for it. I trust you will at least pass that along?
Cody: *smiled grimly* Sure."
11,24984946,Cody,Jinn,"Cody: Regardless. There is still a place for him, in the Jedi Order, should he be prepared to work for it. I trust you will at least pass that along?
Jinn: Of course. When Obi-wan wishes to speak with me, you'll know where I am.
Cerasi: Wooley told us, they took Obi up to your room - figured it would be the most secure, without any windows.
Nield: Go make sure our di'kut Jedi is alright.
Cody: How much did you hear?
Obi-wan: Just, up to you telling him he's the one who made a mistake.
Cody: I don't know. And honestly, I don't care. He's given you up before, I wouldn't trust him not to do it again.
Obi-wan: It's Ashyr.
Cody: Ash'ika, why did you steal this off the ship?"
12,24984946,Cody,Obi-wan,"Cody: Ash'ika, why did you steal this off the ship?
Obi-wan: ...there's more to being a Jedi than just having a lightsaber.
Jinn: But in that case, I will need your lightsaber back.
Obi-wan: Again. *unclipping the weapon from his belt* Don't come near Obi-wan again.
Cody: Was that really necessary, ori'vod?
Cody: Absolutely. *grinning over his shoulder at Obi-wan's raised eyebrow*"
