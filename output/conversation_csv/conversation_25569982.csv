0,25569982,Peter Parker,Tony Stark,"Peter Parker: Hey, Mr. Stark! Peter called out as he entered the lab, his voice echoing through the spacious room.

Tony Stark: Tony looked up from his work, a small smile forming on his face. Hey, kid. What brings you here?

Peter Parker: Peter walked over to Tony's workbench, excitement evident in his voice. I was hoping we could talk about my internship. I've been learning so much, and I wanted to show you what I've been working on.

Tony Stark: Tony leaned back in his chair, his eyes scanning over Peter's eager face. I'm always interested in seeing what you've been up to, kid. Show me what you've got.

Peter Parker: Peter reached into his bag and pulled out a small device, his hands slightly trembling with anticipation. I've been working on this new web shooter design. It's more compact and efficient, and I think it could really improve my crime-fighting abilities.

Tony Stark: Tony took the device from Peter's hands, examining it closely. Impressive work, kid. You've really outdone yourself this time. I can see the potential in this design.

Peter Parker: Peter beamed with pride, his excitement bubbling over. Thanks, Mr. Stark! I've been putting in a lot of late nights to perfect it. I'm glad you like it.

Tony Stark: Tony handed the device back to Peter, a smirk playing on his lips. Keep up the good work, kid. You're definitely on the right track. Just remember to pace yourself. You don't want to burn out.

Peter Parker: Peter nodded, his enthusiasm still evident in his eyes. I will, Mr. Stark. Thanks for the advice. I'll keep pushing myself to be better.

Tony Stark: Tony stood up from his chair, patting Peter on the shoulder. That's the spirit, kid. Just remember, it's not about being the best. It's about doing your best. And you're definitely doing that.

Peter Parker: Peter smiled gratefully at Tony, feeling a surge of determination. I won't let you down, Mr. Stark. I'll keep working hard and making you proud.

Tony Stark: Tony ruffled Peter's hair affectionately, a fond smile on his face. I know you will, kid. Now, let's get back to work. We've got a lot to accomplish together."
1,25569982,Peter,MJ,"Peter: This is a goddamn disaster. *Peter declared miserably.* Could be worse.
MJ: Oh yeah, how? *MJ shrugged.* They could have expelled you instead.
Peter: Thanks MJ, that’s really helpful. I feel so much better now.
Mr. Harrington: Quiet please, quiet down! *Mr Harrington stood at the front of the class, waving his arms, and desperately trying to maintain control of his students.*
Flash: *Even Flash swivelled in his chair and turned to stare.* Did he say field trip?
Ned: *Ned whispered excitedly, grabbing onto Peter’s arm.* Are we really going on a field trip?
Peter: *Peter muttered a nondescript response to Ned’s question, eyeing Mr Harrington with wariness.*
Mr. Harrington: Good, thank you. As I was saying –
Abe: *Abe cut in.* Is it somewhere better than Oscorp?
Betty: *Betty interrupted.* That trip was so strange –
Mr. Harrington: *Mr Harrington snapped, frustration and anger suddenly seeping his tone.* If you were all quiet I would have told you by now!
Ned: *Ned stopped whispering, having previously been guessing where they would be going.* Where do you think it’ll be too?"
2,25569982,Mr Harrington,Ned,"Mr Harrington: “The trip will, as I have said, be on Friday and last all day. You must be at school by 8am when the bus leaves. If you are even a minute late, we will leave without you. We will have lunch on site, and there will be a bus back to school at 4pm.”
Ned: “Where do you think it’ll be too?”
Peter: “I don’t know. Could be anywhere. You know I don’t like field trips Ned. I mean… come on.”
Ned: “I know, I know. You have to admit though that’s had its upsides I mean you get to swing from buildings, and you have super strength and your spidey senses –”
Peter: “Shhhhh!”
Ned: “Sorry, sorry –”
Mr Harrington: “Parker, Leeds! For goodness’ sake what have I just said!”
Betty: “Where are we going, Mr Harrington?”
Mr Harrington: “It’s very exciting actually. I mean, it’s really exciting.”
Class: “Tell us, tell us!”
Mr Harrington: “Class… We’re going to Stark Industries!”
Ned: “You didn’t know?”
Peter: *gave him a dead stare*
Peter: “Ned this is a disaster.”
Ned: “But you’re not.”
Peter: “I know that, obviously. I just think this trip is asking for trouble. Maybe I shouldn’t go. May wouldn’t mind.”
Peter: “I’ll just spend the day holed up in Tony’s lab or something, he’d probably…”"
3,25569982,Peter,Ned,"Peter: But you're not.
Ned: I know that, obviously. I just think this trip is asking for trouble. Maybe I shouldn't go. May wouldn't mind.
Peter: I'll just spend the day holed up in Tony's lab or something, he'd probably barely notice it was the daytime instead of the evening, his sleep schedule is really messed up.
Ned: You have to go! Working for Stark Industries is our collective dream. We have to go. Anyway, I think it'll be cool. You'll have a million opportunities to prove Flash wrong about the internship, that's got to be a bonus.
Mr Harrington: I hope I don't have to remind you both about the necessary good behaviour when we go on the trip. That means no sneaking off, Parker, and no causing trouble of any other kind, for that matter.
Peter: Trouble, sir?
Peter: Yes, trouble, there will be none of it. Am I understood?
May: It isn't funny, May.
May: Oh no, I know, of course not. It isn't.
May: I know, I know!
May: Does Tony know about this?
Peter: He hasn't said anything, but he knows about everything that happens in Stark Tower, no matter how much he likes to pretend he's completely uninterested and above it all. And, even in the smallest possible chance that he didn't know, Pepper definitely does.
May: There, you're going. End of.
Peter: I don't think I should go, if I'm honest, I just think..."
4,25569982,May,Tony,"May: I don’t think I should go, if I’m honest, I just think this trip is asking for trouble.
May: Doesn’t matter. Tony would be very upset to know you aren’t interested in a tour of his company. You’re going.
May: No more buts, Peter. You’re going on that trip, so don’t even think about not handing in your permission slip. I’ll know, and you know that I’ll know.
May: *throwing takeaway menus at him and asking him to pick dinner, effectively ending the conversation.*
May: *giving him a knowing grin and a kiss on the top of his head as he left.*
May: He’s fine Tony. But… I have a favour to ask.
Tony: Ominous, but as always your wish is my command Aunt Hottie. What do you need?
May: *When Friday morning came, Peter dragged himself out of bed with a groan, ignoring May’s teasing through the walls about his reluctance.*
May: *prompting May to laugh harder, and him to slam the door a little too hard on the way out.*
May: *It wasn’t that he didn’t want to tour Stark Tower. Stark Tower was incredible, as was the company that resided in it, and Ned was right in saying that it had always been their joint dream to work there side by side.*
May: *But between the chances of Tony butting in and doing something embarrassing or stupid or over the top, and the fact his classmates didn’t believe he worked as an intern in the first place, it seemed like to perfect recipe for Parker-luck to strike and mayhem to descend.*
Flash: Hey Parker, yo Parker!
Peter: Piss off Flash.
Flash: Ooh tough words Parker."
5,25569982,Flash,Peter,"Flash: How are you feeling this morning Puny? You know, now all of your lies are gonna unravel. You can’t expect to keep them up now we’re actually going to Stark Industries.
Peter: Piss off Flash.
Flash: Ooh tough words Parker.
Peter: Look. Just give it up now and I might let you off. We all know Stark doesn’t take high schoolers as interns. Tell the truth and we’ll all accept that your pathetic attempt at popularity was just because of your sad little life and move –
Flash: Thompson! What do you think you’re doing!
Mr Harrington: Nothing Sir!
Flash: *throwing Peter a murderous look*
Mr Harrington: Leeds, Jones. Please go line up with the rest of the class, the bus is just coming through the gate. Parker, a word?
Peter: Yes, Mr Harrington?
Mr Harrington: Peter. This isn’t going to be a comfortable conversation. I was hoping to avoid it, truly, but after overhearing what Mr Thompson just said…
Peter: Yes that’s corr–
Mr Harrington: Despite the fact that it is common knowledge Stark Industries do not allow high schoolers to intern for them. In fact, you must have completed your first year of a relevant degree before they will consider an application. And even then they only accept five interns per department per year. It is a highly coveted position.
Peter: Mr Harrington if you’d just let me –
Mr Harrington: Now I understand you’ve had a tough couple of years, what with your Uncle passing. But I cannot allow you to spread these lies. It’s gone on long enough Peter. I understand, I really do, and I won’t force you to confront your classmates. Saying that, I would advise you to come clean sooner rather than later. You don’t want this hanging over your head for the rest of your school days.
Peter: *remained silent*
Mr Harrington: Peter I can’t have you saying anything about working for Stark Industries today, is that understood? We are representing the school and if a member of the Stark..."
6,25569982,Peter,Stark Industries,"Mr Harrington: Peter I can’t have you saying anything about working for Stark Industries today, is that understood? We are representing the school and if a member of the Stark Industries team were to overhear your lies, and report it, we would be in serious trouble. Do you understand Peter? If you don’t, I can’t let you on the trip.
Peter: I understood, Sir, is that all?
Mr Harrington: I need you to look me in the eye and tell me that Peter, so I know that you understand. No more lies, okay?
Peter: Understood, Sir, is that all?
Mr Harrington: Thank you Peter, that’s all. We will discuss the rest on Monday morning. Go line up with your classmates.

Ned: What happened? What did he say?
Peter: Doesn’t believe me about the internship. Told me not to spread lies.
Ned: Peter that’s really out of order. He can’t accuse you of lying without proof. Didn’t Stark Industries register some kind of paperwork with the school when you started the internship?
Peter: I’m not sure. Pepper said she would send something along, to see if I could gain any extra credits for doing additional work, but it doesn’t sound like they have anything.
Ned: It doesn’t sound like Ms Potts to forget something like that.
Peter: Which means...
Ned: The school saw it, but they didn’t believe it was real.

MJ: That’s bullshit. The school, I mean, not your idea. Dork is way smart enough to hold an internship like that. They should have at least checked if the paperwork was real, any idiot can do that.
Peter: Thanks MJ."
7,25569982,Peter,Sarah,"Peter: Just give me a lanyard cord, but not the badge. Please, just pretend to give me a badge.
Sarah: Is this your –
Peter: Yeah this is my class, I should be on the list, but they don’t really know I work here. Please?
Sarah: *expression schooled into one of surprise* There you go, all done. Are you excited for the tour?
Peter: Super excited. *clips the badge into place and places the red cord around his neck* Thank you, so much.
Sarah: You’re welcome. *whispers conspiratorially and winks*

Sarah: Right, is that everyone?
Flash: Why does Puny Parker have to go through security? He works here right, surely he should be allowed to just breeze past!
Ned: *whispers to Peter* Just ignore him Peter. You’ll get the chance to prove them all wrong, I know you will.
Peter: I don’t care anymore Ned. I just want to get this whole day over with.

Charles: Good morning, students, teachers. I am Charles Mason, the deputy-head of security here at Stark Tower, and therefore responsible for ensuring each and every one of you is aware of the rules regarding safety during your tour today.
Charles: *gives the room a hard, sweeping look, his eyes only settling a second too long on Peter* This will include the itinerary of your day, the safety precautions and requirements of each division and department you will be visiting, and a recap of your non-disclose agreements."
8,25569982,Charles,Amy Curtis,"Charles: This will include the itinerary of your day, the safety precautions and requirements of each division and department you will be visiting, and a recap of your non-disclose agreements.
Amy: Now, may I introduce your tour guide, Amy Curtis. She will take it from here.
Amy: Good morning everyone! How are we all? Are you excited to begin?
Amy: Oh dear, has Charles exhausted you already? Come on, let's get moving, we have a lot to see! First off, the Avengers exhibition! You're going to love it.
Amy: The exhibit shows all of the original Avengers, including Mr Stark's Iron Man at the forefront of course and the history of his father with the creation of Captain America, but also all the members of the team such as War Machine or the Scarlet Witch who have since trained or fought with them.
Amy: The exhibit is forever growing, that way! Isn't that nice?
Amy: There we go! Okay, I'll do a quick tour all the way through, then the next section on the history of Stark Industries, and then I'll give you an additional half hour to explore any particular exhibit that interests you.
Flash: Parker, oi, Parker! Why aren't you telling us all of this eh, since you're such good friends with Stark? I bet you've made Leeds believe you're mates with the whole Avengers team.
Peter: *kept walking, ignoring him, though his hands were twisting against his jeans.*"
9,25569982,Flash,Captain America,"Flash: How was dinner with Captain America last night, does he cook well? I always wanted to know!
Peter: *ignoring him, though his hands were twisting against his jeans*
Flash's cronies: *laughing hysterically*
Mr Warren: *throws them a terrifyingly dark look*
Peter: *winces*
Peter: Sir, I know –
Mr Harrington: I thought we understood each other, back at the school, Peter. I asked a very simple request of you.
Peter: Perhaps you should have also spoken to Flash. He didn’t seem to get the same memo.
Peter: *turns away from his teacher, furious, and drags Ned away*
Peter: I’m going to scream.
Ned: Please don’t. You know I have weak ears.
Peter: I’m serious Ned. This is awful. Why did I even come.
Peter: *slumps against the wall in defeat*
Ned: *calls him dramatic*
Peter: I think I’m gonna bail.
Ned: You can’t bail! Besides, isn’t today a lab day with Mr Stark? And you can’t even get sick anymore so no one’s going to believe that.
Peter: Mr Harrington doesn’t know that.
Peter: *pushes himself off the wall and dusts down his jeans*
Amy: Okay guys, we’re going to do a brief hour-long tour of the building, just a walk around, until we hit midday. You’ll see all the different company departments that don’t involve practical experimentation – HR, public relations, legal, marketing, etc. Then we’ll go for a half hour lunch… and this afternoon the exciting stuff happens! That’s right, the lab tours!"
10,25569982,Peter,Aadhya,"Peter: Hey Aadhya, I’m good thank you, I’m actually on a field trip with my school class. He jerked a thumb in the direction of his teachers, and Aadhya popped her head further through the window to take a look.
Aadhya: Ah, school, the good old days. Is it the usual then? I’ve just put a fresh batch of bhaji’s in the fryer. They’ll be all crisped up, just how you like them.
Peter: Yeah that sounds amazing thanks, but only a half portion of what I usually get, please. At Aadhya’s curious glance, he clarified. Big breakfast, and to be honest, I’ll probably be back this evening.
Aadhya: *laughed at the admission, disappearing into the back.*
Peter: *leant on the railing and observed the canteen, watching the employee’s go by to see if he knew anyone. It probably wasn’t a good idea. If someone recognised him, Flash would only –*
Flash: So how’d you get the lunch lady to pretend to know you Parker?
Peter: *turned, raising his eyebrows at Flash and the two friends stood behind him.* I don’t know what you’re talking about. He said, hoping that Aadhya would return with his food in just a second. In his peripheral, he could see Ned and MJ making their way to the class’ tables with food bags in hand, having stepped away from the Thai place Ned loved to visit.
Flash: Look, just admit this whole thing is a sham. Honestly, I just feel sorry for you at this point. Flash said, and started to pretend to cry. Oh, oh puny Parker lost his parents and he just can’t cope! The other classmates roared with laughter. Peter didn’t see the funny side. That’s why"
11,25569982,Flash,Peter,"Flash: Look, just admit this whole thing is a sham. Honestly, I just feel sorry for you at this point. *started to pretend to cry* Oh, oh puny Parker lost his parents and he just can’t cope!
Peter: That’s why you’ve made up this ridiculous lie about knowing Tony Stark, right? To compensate? Honestly could you be more pathetic if you –
Peter: Would you just shut up? *snapped, rage boiling up within his chest as he stepped forward and slammed his hand down on the rail he had previously been leaning against. It dented underneath his hand. He went shock still, his entire body shaking.*
Flash: Oh so Puny Parker does have a spine–
Aadhya: Here you go Peter! *reappeared at the counter with a wide smile and a brown paper bag filled with all of Peter’s favourite Indian snacks.* Is everything okay?
Peter: *breathing heavily* Thank you, Aadhya, I’ll see you around.
Aadhya: You too Peter, I put extra sauce in there, just how you like it, and an extra lamb starter. I know it’s your favourite. You have a good tour okay? You know who to call if you need anything.
Peter: Yeah, trust me I know. *whispered, and then added, more sincerely.* Thank you.
Ned: Dude.
Peter: What, Ned?
Ned: What the hell did Flash say to you? You never fight back. Don’t get me wrong, I’m impressed like I’m super impressed like seriously we all saw his face go blank and he definitely deserved whatever you did –
Peter: Ned, it doesn’t matter. He made a stupid comment about my parents. Let’s just have our lunch okay. We only have twenty minutes before the tour keeps going. I want this day over as soon as possible.
Ned: I’m sorry.
Peter: *shrugged in response, already finished with the first container of food, and bringing out two more.* Hey, are these the bhajis you’re always talking about? Can I try one?
Peter: Go for it.
Peter: *watched as Amy turned to Mr Warren and tapped her watch. Mr Warren, in turn, said something to Mr Harrington, and Mr Harrington…Mr Harrington looked at Peter.*"
12,25569982,Mr Harrington,Peter,"Mr Harrington: Peter. *stands from his seat and makes his way over to where Peter was shovelling rubbish into the bin* Would you like to explain to me what your confrontation with Mr Thompson was about earlier? Hm? Over in the corner? Because I just overheard Mr Thompson telling his friends that you were bribing a member of staff to say they knew you.
Peter: That’s ridiculous. I was having a conversation with her, you know, being polite. Flash took it the wrong way and decided to use it to try and incriminate me in something.
Mr Harrington: *takes off his glasses and pinches the bridge of his nose* Peter you’re putting me in a very difficult position right now. You know that, don’t you. I saw the way you walked around so disinterested today, as if you were above it all. I don’t… I just don’t know where this attitude of yours has suddenly come from.
Peter: With all due respect Sir, I have followed all the rules you gave me. I haven’t said a word all day about the internship.
Mr Harrington: You could have told Flash the truth, right there and then. You chose not to do that. Can you explain that to me Peter, why it is that you let this ridiculous lie you’ve made up continue on in such a way? Do you enjoy the make believe? Does it not give you any kind of stress? You’re a smart kid Peter, a really smart kid. I’m trying to understand.
Peter: It isn’t a lie, Sir. *very quietly*
Mr Harrington: Very well Parker. I didn’t want to do this. You are, as I said, a smart kid, but you’ve brought this on yourself. I’ll be calling your Aunt to pick you up from the trip early and first thing Monday morning, I will be speaking to the Principal regarding a suspension.
Peter: Mr Harrington –
Mr Harrington: I said no more lies Parker! *thunders* Sit with your friends whilst I was call your Aunt. To come here, of all places, and tell these fibs… I’m incredibly disappointed in you.
Peter: *watches as Mr Harrington walks away, frozen*"
13,25569982,Peter,Ned,"Peter: Don't Ned, it's fine.
Ned: I should have said something to him.
Peter: Don't, you'll only get suspended too.
Ned: You got suspended?! Oh my god what are you going to do this is insane holy sh–
Peter: Ned, please. Just leave it. Mr Harrington's calling Aunt May to pick me up, I'm not allowed to stay for the rest of the trip. She's going to be so angry I don't even want to think–
Mr Harrington: Your Aunt is not picking up her phone. Do you have any idea why that may be?
Peter: I, uh, no, no I don't. She was due on shift at the hospital this morning, but she should still have her phone on her. If she's been drafted into an emergency it will be switched off though. That's really the only time she'll ever turn it off completely.
Mr Harrington: Let me speak to Amy about what we can do with you, then. You'll simply have to wait downstairs in the lobby for us all to be finished if need be.
Peter: This is a goddamn disaster.
MJ: Could be worse.
Peter: Oh yeah, how?
MJ: They could have expelled you instead.
Peter: Thanks MJ, that's really helpful. I feel so much better now.
Mr Harrington: Amy has spoken to the security department and they have refused to let you sit in the lobby until such a time as the rest of the class has finished with the tour.
Peter: Yes, Mr Harrington.
Mr Harrington: You are in serious trouble young man; I hope you know that. Having to involve the security team in this nonsense means we will almost certainly not be allowed back to Stark Tower.
Peter: I understand, Mr Harrington.
Mr Harrington: I'm very disappointed in you Peter. I thought you were one of our brightest students."
14,25569982,Amy,Stark employees,"Amy: I hope you all enjoyed your lunch. The canteen is a great place for Stark employees to integrate with members of different departments, but they can’t stay here forever! They’ve got work to do! Midtown… It’s time for the lab tours!

15,25569982,Flash,Intern,"Flash: What's that? *pointing at the intern's desk*
Intern: Oh, I'm sorry, I'm too busy to talk at the moment. I'm sure there are other employees happy to speak with you. *her head bowed back down to her work*
Flash: I was only curious about what you were doing.
Intern: That's kind of you, but I'm very busy. As I said, I'm sure other employees are willing to speak with you.
Flash: What project are you working on?
Intern: Young man, I've told you twice that I'm busy, so please return to your class. I am not obligated to explain my work to you. *her voice terse*
Peter: Flash, come on man, she's busy. You heard what Amy said. You gotta leave her alone.
Flash: Sod off Parker. Like you'd risk getting into even more trouble today. I've practically got you expelled already. Serves you right for lying.
Peter: Just piss off Flash. She clearly doesn't want to talk to you. Who would?
Mr. Warren: Haven't you two caused enough trouble today? Really, Parker, after everything that's already happened? Get away from this poor employee, now.
Penny: Thank you, for that.
Peter: Thank you, for that.
Penny: He was only trying to get that other boy to leave me alone.
Mr. Warren: Right, well, thank you for that Peter, let's move along now. We must let the young woman get on with her work. I'm so sorry for the disturbance.
Penny: That's okay, really. Hey, Peter... Do I... do I know you from somewhere? You look so familiar.
Mr. Warren: *indignant noise in the back of his throat*
Peter: No, Penny. I don't think so. It's been nice to meet you though.
Penny: Nice to meet you too.
Mr. Warren: That was good of you. I'll make sure Mr. Harrington knows what you did, it should go in your favor after...
Peter: *did not say anything in return*"
16,25569982,Mr Warren,Mr Harrington,"Mr Warren: That was good of you. *murmured as they returned to the group* I’ll make sure Mr Harrington knows what you did, it should go in your favour after… *trailed off*

Peter: *did not say anything in return*

Amy: Well, we aren’t expecting in the robotics labs for a while yet, *She was saying* So I was suppose we have a little bit of time for a question and answer session with the whole class!

Dr Tarquin: Hello students, I’m Dr Tarquin, I’m the head of the biology department here at Stark Industries. I oversee all ongoing projects with the help of several supervisors and report them to Mr Stark and the board of directors, whilst also conducting my own research primarily within the field of genetics and specifically it’s relation to medical innovation.

Dr Eden: I’m Dr Eden, I’m one of the supervisors working under Dr Tarquin. I help him to manage biological projects under the medical innovation field, and I also supervise the internship programme for the biology department.

Dr Marsedon: And I am Dr Marsedon. I have only been here at Stark Industries for two years so I’m still making my way up the ranks! My speciality is medical technology, so I spend my time split between this lab and several others including robotics and development, researching what technology and equipment Stark Industries may bring to the medical field in the next twenty years.

Betty: How long did it take for you to progress from employee to supervisor, and from supervisor to the head of department?

Dr Eden: It took me six years to progress to supervisor, after finishing my initial training years. There’s a lot of tough competition here at Stark Industries. It takes a lot of determination to progress through the ranks.

Dr Tarquin: I completely agree. *He said* I’ve been here since I graduated from University with my doctorate. You begin as an entry-level employee, learning the ropes, that’s a three-year course. Then it took me seven years to progress to being a supervisor, another four until I was named a lead researcher, and then an additional eight until I was made head of department. Though, I wouldn’t change any of that experience for the world.

Flash: That’s a twenty-two year wait though! *He looked entirely scandalised* Didn’t you ever think of leaving, going somewhere where you would have been allowed to progress quicker?

Dr Tarquin: *raised an eyebrow* There is nowhere better than Stark Industries, young man.

Flash: *blushed* Right. *He muttered* Don’t think I’d wait that long though.

Dr Tarquin: *chose to ignore the comment and continued taking questions*

Dr Eden: Just look at Ms Potts. *She said, ending her speech on the topic, throwing her hands up* I mean… What a role model!

MJ: *nodded* I couldn’t agree more. *Peter thought she might actually have been smiling.*

Amy: Right then… It’s probably best we get to the robotics lab in the research and development facility. *She said, looking worriedly at her watch* We’ve got a practical session all set up for you, so we really shouldn’t cut into our time there.

Peter: *ignored Penny’s curious look as he filtered out of the doors with the rest of his classmates* You should see floor forty-five. *Peter thought, as Ned babbled at his side* That"
17,25569982,Ned,Peter,"Ned: So tell me again what Mr Harrington said.
Peter: And then he told me I’d be suspended, and I would need to go see the Principal first thing Monday morning.
Ned: He’s awful. *Mr Harrington wasn’t stood too far away* I wish you’d just do what I said and prove to them all that your internship is real. Mr Stark would be so angry to know –
Peter: Which is exactly why I’m not including him.
Ned: He’d want to know –
Peter: That doesn’t matter Ned. I mean, it does, I don’t ever want to keep anything from Mr Stark, but he really doesn’t need to know about this, he’d just worry you know what he’s like. *whispered back*
MJ: *smacked the instructions down in front of them* We have to build something. *told them* I’m not doing it by myself.
Peter: Sorry MJ. *mumbled* Uh, what shall we build?
MJ: They settled on building a small robot that could dance. They only had an hour after all – even though Ned’s idea to include voice recognition would have been amazing. *collected their materials*
Peter: *felt his worries about the day slowly melting away with her quiet presence* Moving his hands gave him the clear mind and satisfaction he had been so far from the past few hours.
Flash: You’re gonna pay for what you did earlier, Puny. *pretending to look through materials* Not that it’s gonna matter come Monday. You remember my Mum’s on the board of directors don’t you. By next week she’ll have turned that suspension into expulsion and I’ll never have to look at your stupid lying face ever again.
Peter: And I’ll never have to look at your scrawny squirrel face ever again. What a miracle. *drawled*
Ned: *pressed his lips together to keep from laughing, holding a hand up against his mouth*
MJ: *smirked*
Flash: *went red and in one swift move, turned on his heel and purposefully shoved into Peter, who was holding the almost-assembled robot in his hands.*"
18,25569982,Peter,Ned,"Peter: And I’ll never have to look at your scrawny squirrel face ever again. What a miracle. *Peter drawled.*
Ned: *pressed his lips together to keep from laughing, holding a hand up against his mouth.*
MJ: *smirked.*
Flash: *went red and in one swift move, turned on his heel and purposefully shoved into Peter, who was holding the almost-assembled robot in his hands.*
Peter: *jolted, dropping the robot down onto the table.*
Peter: PARKER. *Mr Harrington’s voice thundered.* I leave you alone for five goddamn minutes –
F.R.I.D.A.Y: Three-strikes-and-you’re-out protocol has been initiated.
Mr Harrington: Three strikes? Authority? What does that mean?
Amy: No, Mr Harrington I don’t think that will be necessary. We should wait for the appropriate authority to arrive, as F.R.I.D.A.Y stated. Your student would be better off staying here, as would you.
F.R.I.D.A.Y: The appropriate authority has been alerted. They will arrive in an estimated fifteen minutes, when their meeting has finished. Please remain where you are. The class may continue with their work in the meantime.
Amy: You heard the woman, continue your work.
Ned: Are you okay dude?
Mr Warren: Mr Parker. I thought we were past this.
Ned: He was shoved! Flash shoved him!
Mr Harrington: Shoving someone would not create this! This is the work of careless handling of expensive materials. Peter… Even after everything that’s happened today, you astound me in your recklessness and negligence. This is unacceptable behaviour for anyone, never mind a student already facing suspension.
Peter: Mr Harrington I didn’t mean to do any damage –"
19,25569982,Peter,Mr Harrington,"Peter: Mr Harrington I didn’t mean to do any damage –
Mr Harrington: “Just like you didn’t mean to tell lies or bribe a Stark Industries employee or disturb an intern in the biology labs.”
Peter: Okay Sir. I’ll wait for Mr Mason then.
Amy: “Oh, I don’t think that’s necessary.”
Tony: I assume you are the two teachers escorting this group of students. Midtown Tech, right?
Mr Warren: Yes, yes Mr Stark, I’m Mr Warren and can I just say it’s an absolute honour to meet you –
Tony: Mr Warren are you aware that one of your students is bleeding?
Peter: Fine. *still not looking up from the robot in his hands* Just a scratch.
Tony: I’ve heard that before."
20,25569982,Tony,Peter,"Tony: You alright kid?
Peter: Fine.
Tony: Just a scratch.
Tony: Arm.
Peter: It's only a -
Tony: I wasn't asking you; I was telling you. Arm.
Tony: What happened?
Peter: Accident.
Tony: That's bullshit.
Tony: Sorry kid.
Peter: It's fine.
Tony: I gotta disagree with you on that bud, the whole fine thing, you know, considering the blood on your arm and your hoodie and your jeans. Wanna tell me what actually happened?
Tony: Mr Parker do not sass Mr Stark, show some respect.
Tony: Oh, you don't need to tell me. I already know. My AI has eyes everywhere. She's been following your tour.
Tony: All done kid. Make sure that stays stuck down, alright.
Tony: Thanks. You've been watching the tour?
Tony: Welcome. And yes.
Tony: Mr Harrington, I presume?
Mr Harrington: Yes, yes that's correct.
Tony: It's uh... well, very good to meet you, Mr Stark, we're honoured. Thank you for allowing us to tour your company, it's been very insightful.
Tony: So I hear. May I ask how you failed to notice one your students was bleeding?
Mr Harrington: Mr Parker didn't inform us of an injury -
Tony: Mr Parker should not have to inform you. He is a minor under your care. You are responsible for his safety and security during school hours and during excursions outside of the classroom such as this. I assume, considering your tone towards him, you were aware of an incident. Did you not think to check he was unhurt?"
21,25569982,Peter,Tony,"Peter: I know, I know. I’m the worst. But May made me promise to look out for you today and intervene if, and only if, things got rough. I think the threat of suspension qualifies as rough kiddo. Don’t worry, I’m leaving now. What’s this though?” He tapped the bitesize robot in Peter’s hands.
Tony: “They gave us a practical, build anything we wanted. It got cracked though.”
Peter: “No bother. Want me to take it to the lab? We can fix it together.”
Tony: “Okay. I suppose. Thanks, Tony, for you know, everything.”
Tony: *reaching out to ruffle the kid’s hair again* “Anytime, pipsqueak. Always here if you need me. You gonna stay after the tour and join us for dinner? May already said it was alright.”
Peter: “Who’s cooking?”
Tony: “Meant to be Rogers, which means we’ll definitely be ordering takeout.”
Peter: “Yeah okay. Tour finishes at four, I have to go get my back from security then I’ll come straight up. You gonna be in the lab?”
Tony: “Amazing. Yeah, that leaves us a couple hours to tinker before we eat so head straight there. I’ve got some new ideas for Natasha’s widow bites, could use the assist of my favourite young adult.”
Peter: “Just get out.”
Tony: “Oof, kicking me out of a lab that I built, paid for and own. Harsh.”
Peter: “I’m only sorry it didn’t work sooner.”
Tony: *laughing* “See you in a few then, kiddo. Behave, listen, learn, all of that malarkey.”
Peter: “Malarkey?”
Tony: “It’s a great word.”
Peter: “Sure. Sure it is.”
Tony: “Don’t knock it till you’ve tried to bambino.”
Peter: “I told you – it wasn’t a lie.”
Amy: “Well… I know it’s been a surprising afternoon, but you can happily say you’re one of the only tour groups ever to see Tony Stark in the flesh! He very rarely makes an appearance. We’re out of time on our practical but feel free to take your creations with you. We’ve got a final visit to the chemistry labs and then you’ll all be on your way.”"
22,25569982,Peter,MJ,"Peter: I want to get into Harvard, man.
MJ: He's the luckiest person in the whole world.
Ned: Are we sure this isn't some kind of a trick, a simulation?
Unknown student: Shut up, don't be stupid.
Unknown student: Kinda deserved it, though, don't you think? He shouldn't have bullied Parker all these years.
Unknown student: Probably just felt sorry for him.
Mr. Warren: Mr. Parker, we wanted to express how incredibly sorry we are.
Mr. Harrington: I'm very sorry. Incredibly sorry.
Peter: That's okay.
Ned: That was kind of a half-assed apology.
Peter: Just looking forward to the tour ending.
Flash: Hey Parker.
Peter: I'm not interested, Flash.
Flash: I know, but I wanted to apologize."
23,25569982,Flash,Peter,"Flash: Hey Parker.
Peter: I'm not interested, Flash.
Flash: I know, but I wanted to apologize.
Peter: *stilled. He turned slowly on his heel to face Flash; his eyes narrowed with suspicion.*
MJ: *hovered by his side, watching the interaction, ready to jump in should they need to.*
Flash: Mr Stark was right. I was a bully and a nasty one. I said things about you and spread rumors and lies that weren't true. I'm sorry I did that.
Peter: *couldn't help but feel sorry for Flash.*
Flash: Maybe. Look, I was wrong, I'm apologizing. Take it or leave it. But I am sorry.
Peter: Okay, thanks.
Betty: Look, there's Mr Stark again!
Peter: *perked up, and sure enough Tony was leaning against the desks at reception, having a seemingly pleasant conversation with one of the staff.*
Tony: Hey again everyone. *winked at Peter* Thought I'd come and collect you myself kid, make sure there was no more trouble.
Peter: No trouble.
Tony: *wound an arm around Peter's shoulder* I'm sorry for the interruption earlier, I hear I cut into your time in the chemistry labs. I hope you all still enjoyed the day.
Abe: It was great Mr Stark Sir!
Flash's crony: Amazing! Your biology labs are brilliant.
Tony: Thank you. I'm glad you enjoyed it. Now, Mr Harrington, Mr Warren, I'm sure that after the events of the day you won't mind if I keep Peter with me instead of sending him back on the bus with you. He'd only be coming straight back here to the Tower. Seems a little wasteful, don't you think?
Mr Warren: Of course, of course. We'll see you on Monday, Peter.
Tony: You'll see both of us. Say sayonara to your friend's kiddo, we've got work to do.
Peter: *shuffled his feet and avoided the eyes of his staring classmates, awkwardly muttering goodbye from beside Tony.*"

Peter: *shuffled his feet and avoided the eyes of his staring classmates, awkwardly muttering goodbye from beside Tony.*
Ned: *strode up and clapped him on the shoulder*
MJ: *smirked at him and held up a hand in goodbye*
Classmates: have an amazing time Peter, you’re gonna have to tell us all about it on Monday!
Peter: *let himself fall against the back wall, eyes sliding shut as they were propelled towards the ninety-third floor, groaning loudly.* Thank God that’s over.
Tony: So.
Peter: So.
Tony: You know I’m gonna ask kid.
Peter: Yeah, I know.
Tony: Why didn’t you tell me about the trip?
Peter: *glanced up* I thought… Well, I knew Flash was probably going to act out, do something stupid, or say something. You know, him not believing my internship was real and all.
Tony: *listened respectively, only humming in agreement.* You thought I’d embarrass you, or get all angry and protective and involved.
Peter: *thought for a moment.* No. Actually… It was kinda perfect. Thank you, Tony.
Tony: *beamed* I’m really glad kid, you’d tell me though, right? If I made you uncomfortable? I can always go in and apologise on Monday, swallow my pride and all.
Peter: I’d tell you, but you didn’t, and I don’t want you to apologise. Are you really going to go into the school on Monday?
Tony: Hell yeah I am. Like I’m going to let them get away with the things they said to you, the things they accused you of! They should know better.
Tony: *continued to ramble on, even after the elevator came to a stop at floor ninety-three and the engineer was steering Peter towards their shared workspaces.*"
