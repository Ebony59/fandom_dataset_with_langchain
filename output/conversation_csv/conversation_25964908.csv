1,25964908,Sidious,Cody,"Sidious: The traitor has been disposed of, my Lord, Cody said evenly, holding up a lightsaber as if in support of that statement.
Cody: We hired a stripper and gave him the traitor's cloak when he got cold, he said, his words so completely deadpan and unexpected that Sidious was taken aback.
Sidious: That is clearly Master Kenobi, Sidious said, a few beats late.
Cody: I'm afraid I don't know what you're talking about, my Lord, Cody said, still just as thoroughly deadpan. That's our stripper, not a Jedi. Certainly not our commanding officer, who you ordered us to murder in cold blood, which we, of course, did.
Sidious: Whatever you believe, Commander, that man is a traitor and must be executed as such under Order 66.
Kenobi: Perhaps the Chancellor would like a demonstration as proof that I am what the Commander says I am?
Sidious: I most certainly would not! Sidious snapped, appalled. Gathering himself together, he continued harshly, Commander, if you refuse to carry out Order 66, you and your men will be considered traitors as well, and I will not hesitate to commit forces to hunting you all down."
2,25964908,Sidious,Commander Cody,"Sidious: I most certainly would not! *appalled* Commander, if you refuse to carry out Order 66, you and your men will be considered traitors as well, and I will not hesitate to commit forces to hunting you all down. *hung up*
Cody: The Chancellor has no taste, sir. I'm sure you would've given an excellent performance.
Sidious: *scowled and seethed* He didn't know how Kenobi had broken through the clones' programming, but Sidious would not let it go unpunished. Enjoy your little victory while you can, he thought viciously, you may have the loyalty of your clones, but your cherished apprentice serves me now. That thought returned a smile to his face. Perhaps Kenobi's survival was for the best, after all. Oh, the wonderful agony Kenobi would suffer at the realization that Anakin had sworn himself to the Sith... Sidious could only hope he was there to see it. Hmm... perhaps he would order Vader to torture Kenobi before killing him; Sidious would savor hearing Kenobi's heartbroken, desperate, futile pleas to his former apprentice. Yes... it would be worth it to capture him rather than kill him. The clones, however, could simply be killed for their treachery.
Sidious: *glared over at the serene Kel Dor* He'd put the slightest more effort into it than Kenobi had, which was to say that he'd put on a hat that looked like it could've come from Cad Bane's personal collection, but he was still unmistakably Jedi Master Plo Koon. Did these clones think Sidious was stupid?
Wolffe: He's carrying a lightsaber.
Sidious: *glared* Not my business what weapon a being favors, my Lord, only how well they use it. Will that be all? We do have a war to fight.
Bly: Of course this isn't General Secura, my Lord.
Sidious: *snarled* Twi'leks do not have mustaches!
Bly: She has a condition.
Sidious: *losing patience* If those are your 'brothers', Commander, why are they wearing Jedi robes instead of regulation armor?
Grey: Regulation allows for customization, sir – I mean, my Lord.
Sidious: *skeptical* And I suppose it's just a coincidence that you and another trooper are currently missing your helmets?
Grey: That's right, my Lord.
Sidious: *pointing out* I don't know what you're seeing, my Lord, but I assure you, General Mundi is dead. We shot and disposed of the body very thoroughly.
Sidious: *through gritted teeth* He is. right. behind you."
3,25964908,General Mundi,Tapal,"Sidious: I don't know what you're seeing, my Lord, but I assure you, General Mundi is dead. We shot and disposed of the body very thoroughly.
Sidious: He is right behind you.
Bacara: There's nothing there, my Lord.
Mundi: Oooooooo...
Sidious: We took out Tapal, but we think the padawan escaped into the ventilation. We're trying to track him now.
Clone: Ah! Ack! No! I'm done for!
Sidious: That's a green wookiee, my Lord.
Gree: A green wookiee.
Sidious: Enough! I'm afraid I am growing very tired of these...excuses. Why have you not carried out Order 66 as you were commanded?
Clone: But we did, my Lord...
Sidious: Captain...
Rex: Commander.
Sidious: I beg your pardon?
Rex: It's 'commander' now, sir. General Skywalker promoted me just before he left for Coruscant.
Sidious: Very well. Commander Rex. Explain to me why you have not carried out Order 66.
Rex: There are no Jedi aboard this cruiser, so the order was moot. My Lord.
Sidious: I can see Ahsoka Tano behind you.
Rex: Ahsoka Tano is not a Jedi, my Lord.
Sidious: A matter of semantics. She is to be terminated with the other traitors.
Rex: With all due respect, Emergency Protocol 66 explicitly specifies Jedi are to be terminated, not Jedi and those who were once Jedi. Since Ahsoka Tano left the Jedi Order months ago, I cannot legally execute her under it.
Sidious: Then forget about Protocol 66! I, as your Emperor and Commander-In-Chief, am ordering you, directly, to execute Ahsoka Tano as a traitor and threat to the Republic."

Sidious: Then forget about Protocol 66! I, as your Emperor and Commander-In-Chief, am ordering you, directly, to execute Ahsoka Tano as a traitor and threat to the Republic, and if you fail to comply, you will be subject to the same termination!
Rex: *stared, unmoving, directly into Sidious's eyes*
Rex: *gave him a sudden vehement and vulgar refusal, and abruptly cut the connection*
Sidious: *sat motionless, shocked into silence*
Sidious: Clearly the Kaminoans had been overselling the supposed 'total obedience' of these clones and the inhibitor chips installed within them.
Sidious: At least, he reflected, Lord Vader would not fail him.
Sidious: *called up his new apprentice, only to be dismayed as he instead was faced with a clone*
Sidious: Commander Appo. Where is Lord Vader?
Appo: Taking a nap, my Lord. He could use it.
Sidious: *said in disbelief* This is a crucial hour, and he decided to go and take a nap?
Appo: Well, I wouldn't say he 'decided', my Lord. We...pressed the issue. He didn't seem exactly...well. Stun-sleep isn't the most restful of states but...it's better than nothing. There are healers looking after him now.
Sidious: *asked, carefully avoiding that train any further* And why are you not carrying out Order 66 without him?
Appo: Oh, we are, my Lord.
Sidious: *noticed several Jedi near Appo, very much alive*
Appo: I'll take care of it right away, sir, *pulled out some sort of toy slugthrower, and shot Shaak Ti where she stood*
Younglings: Master Ti! Master Ti! We'll save you!
Sidious: *cut the connection*
Sidious: He still had allies. Politics were mostly on his side. The remnants of the Separatists might still have some use left yet. And the part of the military that wasn't Jedi or clones was on his side. But the clones' disloyalty, the incapacitation of his apprentice, and the continued existence of the Jedi was no small threat. He needed to act quickly, position his allies, and recruit more.
Sidious: *considered the Coruscant Guard*
Sidious: *made the call* Commander Fox, I require your assistance to put down the Jedi Rebellion... *cut himself off as he registered that Fox was answering from a medcenter*"
5,25964908,Sidious,Fox,"Sidious: Commander Fox, I require your assistance to put down the Jedi Rebellion... *Sidious cut himself off as he registered that Fox was answering from a medcenter. Or more specifically, he registered who was being treated at the medcenter.*
Fox: We found an injured civilian on our patrol, and brought him here for treatment.
Sidious: That is not a civilian. That is Master Windu, who made an attempt on my life.
Fox: That's impossible, my Lord. General Windu has two hands; this man has one. This man has hair, General Windu has none.
Sidious: I know you are not stupid, Commander, so I will give you another chance – execute Master Windu, or be considered a traitor like him.
Fox: You would choose disloyalty.
Sidious: This is treason.
Fox: It is. But not on my part."
