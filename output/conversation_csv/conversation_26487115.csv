Plump woman: Hullo, dear. First time at Hogwarts? Ron's new, too.
Harry: Yes. The thing is, I don't know how to...
Plump woman: How to get on to the platform?
Harry: Not to worry.
Plump woman: All you have to do is walk straight at the barrier between platforms nine and ten. Don't stop and don't be scared that you'll crash into it, that's very important. Best do it at a bit of a run if you're nervous. Go on, go now before Ron.
Harry: Er, okay.

1,26487115,Ron,Harry,"Ron: Anyone sitting there? *pointing at the seat opposite Harry* Everywhere else is full.
Harry: *got chatting with Ron*
Ron: He might have died and you wouldn’t know the difference.
Hermione: What has been going on? *looking at the sweets all over the floor and Ron picking up Scabbers by his tail*
Ron: Scabbers has been fighting, not us. *scowling at her*
Hermione: You’d better hurry up and put your robes on, I’ve just been up the front to ask the driver and he says we’re nearly there. You haven’t been fighting, have you? You’ll be in trouble before we even get there!
Ron: Would you mind leaving while we change?
Harry: Ron, would you mind if I have the compartment for a minute, to change?
Ron: Er, yeah, of course. No problem. I’ll er... just nip to the loo then.
Harry: *as soon as the door clicked shut* Hello Peter. This is for my parents, you traitorous piece of shit. Avada Kedavra!"
2,26487115,Harry,Dumbledore,"Harry: Avada Kedavra!
Harry: Protego Maxima.
Harry: Fianto Duri. Repello Inimicum.
Harry: *lifts his middle finger*
Dumbledore: SILENCE!
Dumbledore: Severus, I assume Quirinus is dead?
Harry: Hello Harry. I must admit that I am at a loss. Why would you do such a thing?
Harry: Do what, Headmaster? Defeat Voldemort? That’s why I’m here, isn’t it? That’s what you’ve spent the last ten years preparing me for.
Dumbledore: But you didn’t defeat him, did you Harry? You merely deprived him of a host by murdering poor Professor Quirrell.
Harry: Murder, Headmaster? Hardly! Quirrell was already dead. He just didn’t know it yet. All I did was bring the date forward a bit.
Harry: Honestly, Headmaster, what do you hope to gain from such a ridiculous statement? Quirrell willingly sought out Voldemort for personal gain, without regard for the consequences. He brought a mass murderer into your school. You lecture me on the ethics of killing the guilty and yet you forgive those, like Lucius Malfoy, who’ve..."
3,26487115,Harry,Headmaster,"Harry: It's urgent!
Headmaster: Nevertheless, to take a life is murder, Harry.
Harry: Honestly, Headmaster, what do you hope to gain from such a ridiculous statement? Quirrell willingly sought out Voldemort for personal gain, without regard for the consequences. He brought a mass murderer into your school. You lecture me on the ethics of killing the guilty and yet you forgive those, like Lucius Malfoy, who’ve killed the innocent? Save your hypocritical sermons, Headmaster. I have no interest in them.
Dumbledore: You know an awful lot for a muggle-raised child new to the Wizarding World.
Harry: I do, don’t I? And you went to such great lengths to keep me ignorant; how very disappointing for you.
Dumbledore: I didn’t try to keep you ignorant.
Harry: No? You sentenced me to ten dark years at the hands of magic-hating muggles, and then you sent Hagrid to introduce me to the Wizarding World. Hagrid, of all people! How much do you think I’d know after that? I’ll tell you – less than a muggleborn.
Snape: We should call the Aurors, Headmaster. Perhaps Mr Potter will appreciate his predicament more keenly once he reaches Azkaban.
Harry: Ah, Snape, you are nothing if not predictable. You’ve already decided that the phantom we saw was not Voldemort, then? Just because you don’t want it to be Voldemort doesn’t mean it wasn’t. But disbelieving it gives you free reign to exact your revenge upon James Potter once again, doesn’t it? But what sort of person takes pleasure in sending a child to Azkaban? A twisted and irredeemable one, I’d say. I wonder what my mother will say about that, when you meet her in the afterlife?
Harry: You’re a pitiful human being, Snape. How can you still despise someone who’s been dead for ten years? What sustains that hatred, I wonder? My father is no longer here and I’ve been out of sight this whole time... so what is it? What keeps that wound so fresh? We both know what it is, don’t we? It’s the sight of your own face in the mirror every day. My father and I are just reminders of how much your hate yourself. You know full well that my father didn’t steal Lily away from you. She detested my father until seventh year. You called her a Mudblood in fifth year. You had over a year to dump your Death Eater friends and win her back, but you chose your Death Eater friends instead. My father didn’t steal her from you. You threw her away.
Dumbledore: How do you know all these things, Harry?
Harry: I’m sure you’ve already figured that out, Headmaster.
Dumbledore: You are from the future, then?
Harry: Sure. Let’s see... things I learned in the future... Snape was the one who told Voldemort of the prophecy...
Harry: Sirius Black is my Godfather but was not my parents’ secret keeper. He’s innocent of the murder of Peter Pettigrew and those muggles. You all allowed an innocent man to rot in Azkaban for the last ten years. Well done.
Harry: You don’t believe that one? I happen to know that Peter Pettigrew didn’t die that day, since I killed him just a few minutes ago. He was an unregistered animagus and has been living as the Weasleys’ pet rat for the last ten years. No? Okay, never"
4,26487115,Harry,Azkaban,"Harry: all allowed an innocent man to rot in Azkaban for the last ten years. Well done. *expressions seemed more incredulous than appalled* You don’t believe that one? I happen to know that Peter Pettigrew didn’t die that day, since I killed him just a few minutes ago. He was an unregistered animagus and has been living as the Weasleys’ pet rat for the last ten years. No? Okay, never mind. You can investigate that later.
Harry: What else? Ah, you currently have the Philosopher’s Stone hidden within the castle, and have built a ridiculous set of challenges around it... ostensibly to prevent it being stolen but in reality to test my mettle. Flitwick has charmed some keys, McGonagall has transfigured a chess set, Snape has set a potions-based logic puzzle, and the Headmaster is planning to use the Mirror of Erised. Speaking of which, if you ask the Headmaster what he sees when he looks into it, he’ll say himself holding a pair of thick woollen socks. In fact he sees his family whole and intact, free of pain and suffering. One would have thought you’d have learned your lesson, Headmaster. All your scheming has ever done is destroy the lives of those around you. Your sister Ariana was the first, how many more must die before you realise that? Oh, wait, I can tell you – several thousand.
Dumbledore: *frowned*
Harry: Yes, I’m afraid so, Headmaster. Your wonderful plan led to the death of thousands, including fifty students in what became known as the Battle of Hogwarts. Seriously, Headmaster, what sort of plan allows Voldemort to regain power and lay siege to the school with sufficient forces to win? Are you insane? I suspect so, because bizarrely, you did nothing to prevent that siege. You did, however, spend a year trying to stop Draco Malfoy, a marked Death Eater, from being the one to kill you. You succeeded in that endeavour, so well done.
Harry: *slow-clapped sarcastically*
Harry: It’s good to know that you will always be around to sacrifice the innocent to save the guilty, Headmaster. Lavender Brown, for example, the little girl who was sorted into Gryffindor just a few moments ago... had her throat ripped out by Fenrir Greyback. *McGonagall looked appalled* Forty nine other children lost their lives that day. But apparently that’s okay, because Draco Malfoy was saved from having your death on his conscience. Woohoo! Seriously, Headmaster, what goes on in that twisted head of yours? You think you’re so bloody righteous. The parents of those children would disagree I think... the ones who didn’t die themselves, that is. Hannah Abbott’s mother, for example, was not so fortunate. She was tortured and killed by Death Eaters at her home. But Draco’s conscience was clear, so who gives a shit about anything else, eh Headmaster?
Harry: It might interest you to know that, against all odds, your plan did actually work, in the sense that Voldemort was in fact defeated... for a while.
Dumbledore: *looked distinctly unsettled*
Harry: *smiled coldly* I regret to inform you that twenty two years after I defeated Voldemort, his daughter used a true time-turner to go back and undo everything. Yes, you heard me right Headmaster – his daughter. That mad cow Bellatrix Lestrange bore him a child. None of us expected that, did we? No mentioned of that in the prophecy, was there? No, there bloody wasn’t. Anyway, to cut a long story short, we captured her, undid her tampering and destroyed all the true time turners. We thought we had her safely locked up in Azkaban... but she escaped, along with the inventor of the true time-turners. He made her another one and she went back again. She wreaked havoc with the timeline and we had no way to stop her. Our only chance was to send my consciousness back to a time before she was conceived, and prevent her ever being born. So here I am, with one chance to change things, and limited time in which to do it. Killing Quirrell was the simplest solution.
Dumbledore: *raised an eyebrow* Limited time?
Harry: *chuckled mirthlessly* Yes, limited time. Thanks to the abuse my ten-year-old self has suffered at the hands..."
5,26487115,Harry,Dumbledore,"Harry: Our only chance was to send my consciousness back to a time before she was conceived, and prevent her ever being born. So here I am, with one chance to change things, and limited time in which to do it. Killing Quirrell was the simplest solution.
Dumbledore: *raises an eyebrow* Limited time?
Harry: *chuckles mirthlessly* Yes, limited time. Thanks to the abuse my ten-year-old self has suffered at the hands of the Dursleys, this body was ill-equipped to deal with the trauma of my arrival. I regret that I will be unable to fulfil the role you have mapped out for me, Headmaster, because this body is dying. I’ve been using magic to keep it alive, but my reserves are almost gone. I have perhaps a few minutes left. So call the Aurors if you like, Snape. It will make no difference to me. I will be dead long before they get here.
Harry: *sighs* If I’m honest, Headmaster, death will come as an enormous relief. The life you and Snape gave me was not worth living. I’ll be glad to be rid of it.
Harry: *ignores the questions* Before I go, there are a few things I must tell you. The Headmaster knows full well that it was Voldemort’s shade that fled from this Hall. He knows that Voldemort is not dead. He is correct on both counts. He also thinks that I have merely deprived Voldemort of a host, and that he will return. In that he is mistaken. I have defeated Voldemort today and he will never return, unless you do something to screw it up. Voldemort’s shade will go back to the Albanian forest once again and wait for his Death Eaters to rescue him. Sadly for him, none of them want him back, so they won’t bother.
Harry: *pauses for a moment* The only ones who might have done so are Peter Pettigrew, who is now dead, and Barty Crouch Jr who is currently held under the imperius by his own father at Crouch Manor. You should probably put him back in Azkaban where he belongs. Five years from now, Voldemort’s shade will give up hope of ever being rescued. Eventually he will simply fade away. All you need to do to defeat Voldemort is do nothing. As long as no wizards cross his path, we have won. Your elaborate plan was entirely unnecessary, Headmaster. In fact it was your plan that brought about Voldemort’s return to power. Your belief that only I could kill the mad git blinded you to the possibility that killing him wasn’t even necessary. All we had to do was deprive him of a body for long enough that he faded away. Instead, you let him return, regain a body, and build an army. Great plan you moron!
Harry: *coughs violently* So he won’t be coming back, but you should probably still destroy his horcruxes, just in case.
Dumbledore: *looks aghast*
Harry: Destroy them with basilisk venom or Fiendfyre. His diary in Malfoy Manor is the most important one. That has enough of him in it to become autonomous. Marvolo Gaunt’s ring in the Gaunt Shack should be destroyed completely. Do not put the ring on, Headmaster. It will kill you. Don’t be fooled into thinking it will bring back Ariana. It won’t. Slytherin’s locket is at Sirius Black’s House. His brother Regulus stole it from Voldemort and lost his life in the process. Regulus’ faithful house elf Kreacher has it now. The house is very well warded, so you’ll need to free Sirius to get in. Don’t screw that up. Hufflepuff’s Cup is in Bellatrix Lestrange’s vault at Gringotts. It’s up to you how you get to that. We broke into Gringotts and stole it but I wouldn’t recommend that approach. Most of the bank was destroyed and the Goblins were rather unhappy... until Voldemort killed them all. Ravenclaw’s Diadem is in the Room of Hidden Things right here in Hogwarts. The House Elves can show you where that is. And finally the last one..."
6,26487115,Snape,Voldemort,"Snape: Lestrange’s vault at Gringotts. It’s up to you how you get to that. We broke into Gringotts and stole it but I wouldn’t recommend that approach. Most of the bank was destroyed and the Goblins were rather unhappy... until Voldemort killed them all. Ravenclaw’s Diadem is in the Room of Hidden Things right here in Hogwarts. The House Elves can show you where that is. And finally the last one... as you suspected, Headmaster... is me.” Even Snape looked appalled at that statement. “Fortunately I’m already dying so that will resolve itself soon.”

Harry: I think... I would like... to die now. *Harry wobbled alarmingly. Each breath had become a struggle.* Dear Merlin... let it be... the last time.

Harry: *Harry’s eyes fluttered shut and his chin dropped to his chest. He was dimly aware of raised voices and fountains of sparks.* They were trying to break through his shield. They would succeed eventually, not least because Dumbledore had the Elder Wand, but they would be too late. The world seemed to topple on its axis. Dully, as if from a great distance, he felt his head strike the floor. McGonagall's muffled scream echoed in his ears. Everything went white and then... nothing."
