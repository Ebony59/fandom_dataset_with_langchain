0,26487370,Harry,Dumbledore,"Harry: You again.
Dumbledore: Hello Harry.
Harry: Don't bother offering me the choice. I chose to go on.
Dumbledore: Go on?
Harry: Yes. Go on. Board the train. Continue the journey. Start the next great adventure... however you want to put it.
Dumbledore: Ah. You think you're dead then?
Harry: Okay, fine. We're in limbo, I'm not dead yet. Merlin, you're such a nit-picker! Let's just get on with it shall we?
Harry: Why aren't your robes white?
Harry: ARGH!
Harry: I'm not dead. This actually is the Hospital wing. You saved me!
Harry: God damn you! God damn you all!
Dumbledore: You would rather be dead?
Harry: After the life I've had? Of course I would! Don't pity the dead; pity the living. You told me that. How right you were.
Harry: So you saved me just in case Voldemort returns?
Dumbledore: We saved you because it was the right thing to do.
Harry: Yeah, sure. I'm to be tried for murder then?
Dumbledore: I'm afraid the trial has already happened. With hundreds of witnesses the evidence was overwhelming. It was not felt that your testimony was necessary.
Harry: Of course not. Why would it? First Sirius and now me... You never learn do you? So what was my sentence... the Veil?
Dumbledore: They pushed heavily for it, but I managed to get it reduced to twenty years in Azkaban."

Dumbledore: *surprised*
Harry: Of course not. Why would it? First Sirius and now me... You never learn do you? So what was my sentence... the Veil?
Dumbledore: They pushed heavily for it, but I managed to get it reduced to twenty years in Azkaban.
Harry: *mirthless chuckle* Great. You saved me from a swift death and consigned me to twenty years of torture instead. Perfect! Thanks for that. With friends like you I think I prefer my enemies.
Dumbledore: It will give you a chance at redemption.
Harry: Bullshit! It will give you the chance to wheel me out again if Voldemort returns. It might even make me more pliable, and in the meantime it will stop me from telling everyone about the future.
Dumbledore: You judge me too harshly... but no, we can’t allow you to corrupt the present. Time travel is forbidden for a reason.
Harry: You really are a ruthless bastard, you know that.
Dumbledore: It brings me no pleasure to see you incarcerated, Harry. But I must do what is right, not what is easy. In any case, there was nothing I could do – the entire Wizengamot was against you. Your case was open-and-shut. None of us is above the law.
Harry: Oh that’s rich! In my fifth year they tried to arrest you for plotting against the Minister. What do you suppose happened? Did you agree to go quietly and face a trial? No, of course not! You got Fawkes to spirit you away. You could do the same for me now... but you won’t will you? Having me locked up in Azkaban fits your plans perfectly.
Dumbledore: *about to object*
Harry: Enough, Headmaster. I don’t want to hear it. Just make sure you get Sirius released. He’s innocent. Get him out. No excuses; just do it. One more thing – before I go to Azkaban I would like to see Hermione Granger. If you arrange that, I’ll go quietly.
Dumbledore: *enters with Hermione Granger*
Harry: Hello Hermione, Happy Birthday!
Hermione: *hesitant* Hello... um, Harry. Thank you.
Harry: Don’t be scared. I would never hurt you. In any case, they took my wand. I don’t know what they’ve told you... But I’m a seer of sorts. I have seen you many times in my... visions. First though, I want to apologize if you were scared at the Welcome Feast. I did what I did to avert a truly awful future, and now I must pay the price for that. But before I..."
2,26487370,Dumbledore,Kingsley,"Dumbledore: Kingsley, welcome! Refreshments?
Kingsley: No thank you headmaster. I can’t stay long.
Dumbledore: Of course. So how is Mr Potter?
Kingsley: The same – Harry has spent every minute of every day for the last six months just sitting on his bed staring out the window; he seems to sleep in that position. If we enter his cell he just stares right through us. He responds to instructions like ‘stand’ but he never replies to questions. We’re pretty sure his mind is gone.
Dumbledore: He eats though?
Kingsley: Yes Headmaster, his meals are always finished. The guards give him extra sometimes, and sneak him chocolate. There’s never been a child in Azkaban before... and despite what he did, it’s a very hard thing to see. He’s so small. We’ve lost seven guards so far, including one today. It was her first day on the job. She took one look at Harry and walked straight out of the castle. We received her resignation by owl.
Dumbledore: Thank you, Kingsley. I’ll see you in another month.
Kingsley: Yes Headmaster."
3,26487370,Dumbledore,Kingsley,"Dumbledore: It’s a very hard thing to see. He’s so small. We’ve lost seven guards so far, including one today. It was her first day on the job. She took one look at Harry and walked straight out of the castle. We received her resignation by owl.
Kingsley: Thank you, Kingsley. I’ll see you in another month.
Dumbledore: Yes Headmaster.
Dumbledore: Harry’s condition was a worry, but couldn’t be helped. Hopefully he’d recover once he’d served his sentence. It had happened before, though admittedly not after twenty years. In the meantime, Dumbledore couldn’t decide what to do about the Horcruxes. Should he retrieve them, as Harry had recommended? If he did, how would that change the timeline? It was a conundrum he was nowhere near solving. Fortunately, he had plenty of time to think about it. His contacts told him that Voldemort’s shade was back in Albania and going nowhere anytime soon.
Harry: On the day he’d arrived, Harry had examined his cell as the door clanged shut behind him. It was incredibly medieval – bare stone walls, one tiny barred window, a rough-hewn wooden bed with a badly stained brown mattress, rusty iron door and a hole in the floor to serve as a toilet. Harry dragged the bed into the centre of the room, clambered onto it and sat cross-legged with his back to the door. He was now in the exact middle of the room, looking out at the tiny sliver of grey sky through the window.
Harry: All things considered, this was actually quite luxurious compared to the cupboard under the stairs. He’d been confined to the cupboard for much of the last few months, thanks to an incident at the zoo which had happened before he ‘arrived’. He had no complaints though. It gave him a chance to practice, and practice he had. Every minute of every day for months, all he’d done was sit cross-legged in his cupboard, trying to cast a wandless patronus. It had been a gruelling and frustrating task, but with little else to occupy his time, he ploughed on. This would be the key to his backup plan.
Harry: He was pretty sure he was going to die in the Great Hall, but if he didn’t then Azkaban seemed a likely outcome. Fudge would never believe the ‘I was killing Voldemort’ defence, for starters. There was also Harry’s use of an Unforgivable. He’d considered other spells, but they could be blocked. With a table full of professors, including Dumbledore, there was always the slim chance that someone would get a shield up in time. Only Avada Kedavra was a sure kill, and killing Quirrell was essential. He couldn’t be allowed to survive, in case he set that troll free in the castle and it killed Hermione. Harry was pretty sure that Dumbledore wouldn’t want to see Harry dead, but wouldn’t want an adult-Harry-from-the-future walking around in child-Harry’s body either. All in all, Azkaban seemed a pretty certain bet, if he survived the Great Hall.
Harry: So Harry spent his time in the cupboard trying to cast a wandless patronus, with very little success. Finally, after four demoralising weeks, he got a tiny silvery wisp of vapour, and then it was gone. Harry had been jubilant – now he knew it could be done! He’d known in theory that it was possible – his episodes of powerful accidental magic and the strength of his wand-based patronus suggested as much – but it was an enormous relief to have it proved. Harry was energised by that success and over the next several weeks he was able to achieve more. By the time he boarded the Hogwarts Express, he could create a flame-like wisp the size of a pear for about an hour... or something smaller almost indefinitely. He also found that he could give it instructions, despite it not being fully corporeal. He didn’t use it to send messages, of course, he merely told it to stand guard while he slept and wake him if danger approached. Harry had other skills he needed to learn, but the patronus was the first and most important step – it would preserve his sanity while he learned everything else.
Harry: As he sat in his cell in Azkaban, Harry could already feel the oppressive weight of the Dementors sucking the joy from him. They would come soon, he suspected – ‘fresh meat’ was no..."
4,26487370,Harry,Dementors,"Harry: The patronus was the first and most important step – it would preserve his sanity while he learned everything else.
Harry: They would come soon, he suspected – ‘fresh meat’ was no doubt a powerful lure for them – so he quickly cast a patronus wisp and held it in his cupped palms.
Harry: Fortunately, Dementors couldn’t enter the room unless a guard unlocked the door, so Harry should be fine.
Harry: He made it grow steadily larger to match the increasingly malign presence of the approaching Dementors.
Harry: He kept his back to them, but he sensed their malevolence settling on the room like a thick and suffocating blanket.
Harry: He focused on the wisp and pushed back, until the encroaching misery was halted.
Harry: He wanted them to think it was a natural response to their presence – that he was somehow immune.
Harry: He set a wisp to stand guard and fell into an instant sleep.
Harry: He woke instantly, shook off his fatigue as best he could, and prepared for battle once more.
Harry: He would wake to the sound of his wisp squealing, battle the dementors, drive them off, eat if there was food, scratch the wall if it looked like breakfast, use the toilet if he needed to, set his wisp on guard duty, and then sleep until the next alarm.
Harry: Harry kept track of the days by scratching lines on the wall.
Harry: He was tired beyond words, but fought on.
Harry: He would never completely let his guard down, but for now he felt safe turning his mind to other things.
Harry: Over the last two months he’d spent most of his time sitting cross-legged facing the window, fighting the Dementors.
Harry: His wisp would alert him with a lower-pitched squeal when human guards were approaching, so he’d quickly assume his cross-legged pose and hide his wisp.
Harry: As far as the Aurors could tell, he never moved."
5,26487370,Harry,Sirius,"Harry: Sirius, he whispered.
Sirius: The bundle of rags on the bed didn’t stir.
Harry: Sirius! Still nothing.
Harry: Wake him up gently would you?
Harry: Don’t be alarmed, Padfoot – it’s only me, Prongs Junior.
Sirius: The pile of rags span around and scrambled away to the far corner of the bed. A filthy face framed by long straggly hair stared at him with wild eyes.
Harry: Take your time, Padfoot. I can imagine this is all a bit of a shock. I reckon we have a few hours before the next patrol, so there’s no rush.
Sirius: The ragged figure looked like it was consciously piecing its thoughts together. “Ha...” His voice cracked and broke. He coughed and cleared his throat before trying again. “Ha... Harry?”
Harry: The very same. It’s good to see you, Sirius.
Sirius: There was silence for a few seconds, then Sirius scrambled across the room and engulfed Harry in a fierce hug. Harry! What are you doing here! You have to get out before they catch you!
Harry: Harry hugged Sirius right back and chuckled They already did. I have a lovely cell about..."
6,26487370,Harry,Sirius,"Harry: The very same. It's good to see you, Sirius.
Sirius: *scrambled across the room and engulfed Harry in a fierce hug* Harry! What are you doing here! You have to get out before they catch you!
Harry: *hugged Sirius right back and chuckled* They already did. I have a lovely cell about twenty floors down from this one.
Sirius: *roared* WHAT?
Harry: *hissed* Shhhhh! Keep it down, would you? Yes, I'm a prisoner here too. It's a long story. Don't worry about it - I have a plan so we should be out of here in a few months. Now let me go and I'll tell you the story. You're not going to believe this... but I'm not actually eleven years old...
Harry: *told Sirius an abbreviated version of his past* He glossed over a lot of the more painful details, and didn't say who died when, but all the main events were there. Given Sirius' fragile condition he didn't think it would be wise to tell him everything. He'd do that at a later date. For now, all Sirius needed to know was that Harry was an adult and had come back from the future to fix things before it all went wrong.
Harry: *cast it on the first solo guard who walked past* He told the guard to hand over his wand, then placed the imperius on him again using the wand, just to be sure. He instructed the guard to acquire two wands that wouldn't be missed and bring them to Harry. He then gave the guard his wand back. The guard brought the wands two days later. Harry gave one to Sirius, and told him to start building up his magical strength.
Harry: *instructed his wisp patronuses to locate every single prisoner that had the Dark Mark* He knew there were at least ten of Voldemort's inner circle here (or eleven if Crouch Junior was back) but there must be way more than that. He also set about placing every single guard under the imperius. He probably didn't get all of them but he got most, and he instructed them to imperius the ones he'd missed, plus any new arrivals. He instructed them to wait in the entrance hall if the castle ever fell under attack, and not call for help.
Harry: *decided it was time to make his bid for freedom* Sirius was strong enough to help defend them if necessary, and Harry felt the date was auspicious - it was the Spring Equinox, which symbolized change, cleansing, and new beginnings.
Harry: *began his preparations* With the stolen wand, he cast one wisp patronus after another, until the air above him was a blinding halo of silvery white lights. He transfigured his stripy prison uniform into bright white robes, which would further blind any Dementors or Aurors that got in his way. That wasn't all though. In his spare time, Harry had been working on something special - a patronus of a very specific shape. He hadn't been sure it was possible, but he figured it was worth a shot. If Tonks could subconsciously change her patronus, then maybe Harry could consciously change his.
Harry: *pointed his wand at his left hand and cast one more patronus* A jet of silvery-white mist struck his left hand and began to elongate outwards. Once it was about two feet long, the fuzzy shape hardened into the unmistakable outline of a glowing white sword. A handle and guard formed in Harry's palm and he gave the sword a swish. It felt almost weightless, but followed his hand as if he truly held a sword. A very nasty grin spread across his face.
Harry: *unlocked his cell door and strode purposefully out into the corridor* giving instructions to one of his patronuses..."
7,26487370,Harry,Dementors,"Harry: You have no idea who you're dealing with, do you? *laughs manically*
Harry: Scatter them, but don't let them leave this floor or rush at me in numbers. Help me take them down one at a time. *gives instructions to his patronuses*
Harry: *charges at the nearest Dementor*
Harry: *cuts down Dementors*
Harry: Hey little train! Wait for me! I was held in chains but now I'm free. I'm hanging in there, don't you see. In this process of elimination.
Harry: Hey little train! We're jumping on the train that goes to the Kingdom. We're happy, Ma, we're having fun. It's beyond my wildest expectation.
Harry: *dispels one of the swords, grabs his wand, and resumes extermination of Death Eaters*
Harry: Hey little train! We're jumping on the train that goes to the Kingdom. We're happy, Ma, we're having fun. And the train ain't even left the station.
Harry: *continues killing Death Eaters*
Harry: O children, lift up your voice, lift up your voice. Children, rejoice, rejoice.
Harry: *realizes Bellatrix Lestrange is dead* *feels sad emptiness*
Harry: *shakes head in disgust*
Harry: Merlin's beard, Harry. You look like an avenging angel.
Harry: That was the look I was going for, yeah. May as well do it right, eh? You ready?
Sirius: You know, I was having quite a nice snooze 'til you started singing and blowing stuff up.
Harry: Yeah... Sorry about that. It was just something motivational, but I..."

Harry: That was the look I was going for, yeah. May as well do it right, eh? You ready?
Sirius: You know, I was having quite a nice snooze 'til you started singing and blowing stuff up.
Harry: Yeah... Sorry about that. It was just something motivational, but I got a bit carried away.
Sirius: I heard. So who was the girl?
Harry: What girl?
Sirius: The girl you sang that song for.
Harry: What makes you think I was singing it for a girl?
Sirius: Just a hunch.
Harry: I have no idea what you're talking about. Anyway, we need to get going. You know what to do - transform into Padfoot so the Dementors ignore you. Only transform back if you need to use your wand.
Harry: From this day forth you will patrol outside the castle. You will prevent escapes, but you will not feast on the prisoners and you will not leave this island. If you do, I will return and wipe you from the face of the earth. You are mortal now, never forget that.
Harry: You! Bring two fast brooms.
Dumbledore: I told you to free Sirius. You didn't. If Voldemort returns you're on your own. I'm done with you."
