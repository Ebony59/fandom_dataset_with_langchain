0,26487928,Hermione Granger,Neville Longbottom,"Hermione: I think you must have the wrong person.
Neville: It says Hermione Granger on the label. I'm pretty sure that's you.
Hermione: Yes, thank you Neville, but I'm not expecting anything. Who on earth could have sent it?
Neville: Open it up and find out."
1,26487928,Hermione Granger,Neville,"Neville: It says Hermione Granger on the label. I'm pretty sure that's you.
Hermione: Yes, thank you Neville, but I'm not expecting anything. Who on earth could have sent it?
Neville: Open it up and find out.
Hermione: I'm sorry I doubted you. You're very beautiful, aren't you? *stroked the owl's head* The bird preened as if to say, 'Well obviously', gobbled down the chunks of sausage that Hermione offered, then took off and flew from the Hall.
Hermione: *regarded the package like it might bite her* She wasn't a fan of the unknown. Unexpected presents were more likely to be pranks to belittle her than genuine gifts.
Hermione: *with a sigh, fully expecting it to blow up in her face* She began to carefully undo the wrapping. A very thick leather tome was revealed. It was beautifully bound. Hermione ran her fingertips across it reverently, feeling the distinctive texture of the binding, and then she read the title on the front:
Hermione: Oh my goodness. *quickly lifted the cover* Inside was a hand-written inscription:
Hermione: *gasped* Dear Miss Granger, This is the one and only copy of all the notes and interviews that went into writing the First Edition of my book, 'Hogwarts: a History'. Nobody has ever seen these, and I feared that nobody ever would. I have been searching in vain for a safe pair of hands to preserve this valuable but sensitive historical record. A family friend persuaded me that you are that person. As you will see, a great deal of information was deleted from the version that eventually went into print. An entire chapter on the House Elves was removed, for example, and two chapters regarding the Cursed Vaults. They were deleted on the orders of the Board of Governors and the Ministry. Needless to say, you must not share this book with anyone. Happy birthday, and if you are ever in Godric's Hollow do stop by for tea. Yours sincerely, Bathilda Bagshot.
Hermione: *both hands covering her mouth, and her eyes had grown to the size of saucers* Very slowly and deliberately, she opened the book at a random page and read a few lines. With a startled, Eep! she slammed the book shut and quickly re-covered it with wrapping paper. Her hands went back to her mouth and she stared at the book in disbelief.
Neville: What is it, Hermione?
Hermione: *trembling* It's... it's... *tears gathered in her eyes and trickled down her cheeks* It's the most wonderful thing I've ever seen.
Neville: *handed her a slip of parchment* This note fell out.
Hermione: *glanced down at it* Please look after Luna and Ginny for me - H.
Neville: Do you know who 'H' is?
Hermione: *bewildered* I have absolutely no idea.
Neville: Well that's weird. Maybe Luna and Ginny will know.
Hermione: *astounded* You know who this Luna and Ginny are?
Neville: I think so. Ron has a sister called Ginny who was sorted into Gryffindor a few weeks ago. There was also a blonde girl called Luna something sorted into Ravenclaw. I guess that's them?"
2,26487928,Hermione,Neville,"Hermione: There’s a note, Hermione. Maybe read the note?
Neville: Stop prevaricating Hermione. Read the note.
Hermione: What does that mean? Does anyone know a werewolf?
Neville: Maybe that will give us more clues?
Hermione: Well, I’m certainly not going to go looking for one!
Hermione: Erm, Professor... A friend of mine sent me a Runes book. I was just wondering if you’ve heard of it.
Professor Babbling: It can’t be...
Professor Babbling: Impossible... Lost for centuries... Just a legend...
Professor Babbling: Ignotus Peverell!"
3,26487928,Babbling,Hermione,"Babbling: Just a legend... *pulling her desk draws open and slamming them shut again* Ignotus Peverell!
Babbling: Don’t move Miss Granger. Everyone else, out! Out, out, OUT! Class is cancelled. Tell the others. Out!
Babbling: Ask Professor Dumbledore to join us immediately, *instructing the silver badger* if he is available.
Hermione: Professor, is everything okay?
Babbling: Yes, Miss Granger, everything’s fine. It’s just... I think this book may be very special.
Hermione: No, professor – they just sent it for my birthday, along with another one on Arithmancy.
Babbling: Could you place it on the desk please Miss Granger.
Hermione: *placing the book on the desk*
Babbling: Philosophiæ Naturalis Principia Arithmantica by... *slowly backing away from the table* *fainting into a heap on the floor*
Hermione: I don’t know Headmaster! I showed her some books I got for my birthday and she passed out!
Headmaster: What has happened to Professor Babbling, Miss Granger?
Headmaster: Ah, I see. Yes, that would do it. Principia Arithmantica! Amazing.
Hermione: I’m afraid so, Headmaster.
Headmaster: Oh, don’t worry Miss Granger. I’m sure the text is still there.
Headmaster: Perhaps you should take a seat, Miss Granger.
Madam Pomfrey: What on earth happened, Headmaster?
Dumbledore: Shall we see if we can make..."
4,26487928,Dumbledore,Hermione,"Dumbledore: Perhaps you should take a seat, Miss Granger. *steered her by the shoulders towards one of the student desks.*
Pomfrey: What on earth happened, Headmaster?
Dumbledore: Bathsheda had a bit of a shock. *turned back to Hermione* Shall we see if we can make it two for two? *summoned another ghostly phoenix and told it, Please ask Professor Vector to cancel her lesson and join us immediately.*
Vector: Headmaster is everything okay? What’s going on?
Dumbledore: Ah, Septima, thank you for joining us. Miss Granger here has been given an Arithmancy book for her birthday and we wondered if you might take a look at it?
Vector: A book, Headmaster? You asked me to cancel a lesson because of a book?
Dumbledore: Indulge me, *pointed at the book on the desk.*
Dumbledore: Well, Miss Granger, your presents have certainly caused a stir. Might I ask who was so generous?
Hermione: Er, well... I’m not really sure Headmaster. They were brought by owl, with a note.
Dumbledore: Is that so? Could I read the note, perhaps?
Hermione: No, Headmaster. I don’t know who it is. Do you?
Dumbledore: I suspect so, yes.
Hermione: Is it someone... dangerous?
Dumbledore: To you, I think not. To the rest of us, very dangerous indeed.
Dumbledore: I wonder if you might do me a great favour, Miss Granger? Would you perhaps lend these books to the school? I dare say that Professors Babbling and Vector would love to study them, and would greatly appreciate your help in doing so. We would have to house them in the Restricted Section of the library of course, since they’re so precious, but you would be given unrestricted access.
Hermione: *draw dropped open.*
Dumbledore: I’m sure we can rely on you not to misuse that privilege, *continued.* If you will permit me, I will take these books there now and speak to Madam Pince. *reflected for a moment.* I might ask Professor Flitwick to join me too. May as well go for the full house, eh? Poppy, when you’ve seen to Bathsheda and Septima, could you pop over to the Library? I suspect I’ll have two more for you there.
Pomfrey: *gave him a very disapproving look.*
Dumbledore: Do I have your permission, Miss Granger?
Hermione: Oh, to borrow the books – yes, yes of course.
Dumbledore: *gave her his best grandfatherly smile,* Thank you. Professors Babbling and Vector will no doubt speak to you tomorrow about your new... projects. Might I suggest that you drop a couple of electives to make room – Divination and Muggle Studies, perhaps? I think you would struggle to fit."

Hermione: Oh, to borrow the books – yes, yes of course.
Dumbledore: Thank you. Professors Babbling and Vector will no doubt speak to you tomorrow about your new... projects. Might I suggest that you drop a couple of electives to make room – Divination and Muggle Studies, perhaps? I think you would struggle to fit everything in, *leaned forward and whispered* even with the time-turner, *and winked*. Now, why don’t you head off for lunch? You look a bit peaky.
Hermione: *stumbled unsteadily from the room and wandered sightlessly towards the Great Hall.*
Neville: Are you okay, Hermione?
Hermione: You’re never going to believe what just happened."
6,26487928,Hermione,Ginny,"Hermione: I don’t understand. Is there a Ball? Is that why we had to bring dress robes? How does he know that? And how does he know that Cedric will be chosen as the Hogwarts Champion, or that the first task is dragons?
Ginny: Maybe the present will give us a clue?
Hermione: *unwraps the package* Holy SHIT!
Ginny: Language!
Hermione: Never mind my language. That necklace must have cost ten thousand galleons, at least!
Ginny: Well, you can’t exactly send it back, can you? But I’ll have it if you don’t want it.
Neville: Erm, you do realise that those books you got last year are probably worth a thousand times that much?
Hermione: WHAT?
Ginny: Damn it, Hermione! How can you not have known that? Seriously!
Luna: It’ll be the Wrackspurts. You get them every year on your birthday.
Hermione: The question is, how did he know what earrings I’d bought for myself? I haven’t shown them to anyone!
Ginny: He must be stalking you.
Hermione: He is not stalking me!
Ginny: How else do you explain it then?
Hermione: Maybe he... well, perhaps he... Oh I don’t know! Why would anyone stalk me?
Ginny: Because you’re gorgeous?"
7,26487928,Ginny,Hermione,"Ginny: “He must be stalking you.”
Hermione: “He is not stalking me!”
Ginny: “How else do you explain it then?”
Hermione: “Maybe he... well, perhaps he... Oh I don’t know! Why would anyone stalk me?”
Ginny: “Because you’re gorgeous?”
Hermione: “I am not gorgeous.”
Ginny: “Half the boys in the school would disagree.”
Ginny: “I’d do you, for sure.”
Hermione: “Ginny!”
Ginny: “What? I’m just saying. How about you, Luna?”
Luna: “Oh yes, I’d do you Hermione. I’d do you too Ginny; and you, Neville. You're all very shaggable. Not at the same time though. I’m not that bohemian.”
Luna: *continues to eat her breakfast, completely oblivious*

Hermione: “As ‘H’ had predicted, Cedric Diggory was chosen as the Hogwarts champion. Hermione wasn’t comfortable telling him that the first task was dragons, in case it wasn’t. Still, she asked Hagrid, their Care of Magical Creatures professor, where the dragons were being kept. When he said, ‘How do you know about that?’ she knew that ‘H’ was correct. She still hesitated though, because telling Cedric felt like cheating.”
Ginny: “Ginny discovered that her brother Charlie was at Hogwarts, so she owled him and they met up. Charlie confirmed that Madam Maxime and Igor Karkaroff had both been seen checking out the dragons, so Fleur and Krum were probably aware. After some soul-searching, Hermione reluctantly informed Cedric.”

Hermione: “To her enormous surprise, Victor Krum invited Hermione to the Ball, but she had literally never met him so she turned him down and he went with a Beauxbatons girl instead. As third years, Ginny and Luna could only go if an older student invited them. Since nobody seemed to want to go with Luna, Hermione went with her. That did cause a few salacious rumours, but Hermione ignored them and Luna didn’t seem to notice. Ginny went with Neville. It caused quite a stir when Hermione and Luna entered the Great Hall. They both looked absolutely stunning.”
Hermione: “Coming together had proved to be a stroke of genius – their lack of a male partner seemed to encourage all the other boys to ask them to dance. Neither one of them was short of invitations all evening. Victor was the first to ask Hermione, who was happy to oblige. Cedric also danced with her, and thanked her for tipping him off about the dragons. He’d barely escaped as it was. If he’d gone in unprepared he wasn’t sure he’d have survived, so he credited her with probably saving his life. Hermione felt better about telling him after that. Her dance card was full all night – she danced with Neville, Justin Finch-Fletchly, Ernie MacMillan, Terry Boot, Anthony Goldstein, Michael Corner, and many others.”
Hermione: “One of the few boys she didn’t dance with was Ronald Weasley. Hermione was good friends with Ginny, but she’d never had anything in common with Ron so they rarely spoke. He’d been quite unpleasant to her on Halloween in their first year, and she’d never quite forgiven him. She was rather annoyed to discover that he’d come without a date though. He could have invited Luna, but either he never thought of it... or he would rather have no date at all, which Hermione thought was most uncharitable.”
Hermione: “Maybe it was for the best though – he was wearing the most ridiculous salmon-pink dress robes, and was being a thorough bore by refusing to dance. Hermione and her friends had a truly fantastic evening. The insanely jealous looks that Hermione’s necklace garnered from the other girls were just the icing on the cake.”

Hermione: “As Hermione entered her fifth year she realised that ‘H’ had known things which he could only have known if he was a seer. Since Hermione didn’t believe in seers at all – her brief experience of Trelawney in Divination had confirmed her suspicion that it was all nonsense – she’d puzzled over that for a long time. Her confusion increased further when she remembered the bizarre events of her first term at Hogwarts. The infamous Harry Potter had assassinated Professor Quirrell in front of the..."
8,26487928,Ginny,Hermione,"Ginny: Who knows? I’m sure lover-boy has his reasons.
Hermione: What do you mean lover-boy?
Ginny: Oh please. He sends you the most amazing presents every year, and never asks for anything in return. He’s totally in love with you, and he’s got it bad – really bad.
Hermione: Don’t be ridiculous! He doesn’t even know me."
9,26487928,Hermione,Ginny,"Hermione: Don’t be ridiculous! He doesn’t even know me.
Ginny: Want a bet? I reckon he knows you better than you know yourself. I bet this package, whatever it is, will be perfect for you – something you didn’t even realise you needed. Why don’t I open it and see?
Hermione: Stop that! Boundaries, remember!
Ginny: Boundaries are for people who don’t have six older brothers. Come on then, open it up!
Hermione: Isn’t he gorgeous!
Ginny: Well there you go – he sent you something you didn’t even realise you needed – an ugly cat.
Hermione: Don’t listen to her, she’s just jealous.
Hermione: Hello Crookshanks, I’m Hermione. We’re going to be great friends, I can tell.
Luna: I think he might be half Kneazle. They’re very intelligent and can tell if someone is untrustworthy. If Crookshanks doesn’t like anyone, you should probably stay away from them.
Ron: *walked past* (no direct engagement)
Hermione: H had sent her something she didn’t even realise she needed.
Neville: *had the great idea of turning it into a planetarium* (no direct engagement)
Hermione: During her Runes exam Hermione had misread Ehwaz as Eihwaz... but then caught herself.
Hermione: There was absolutely no way the mysterious ‘H’ could have known she would do that unless he really could see into the future.
Hermione: *opened the note straight away* (no direct engagement)
Luna: *read it out loud* (no direct engagement)"
10,26487928,Luna,Hermione,"Luna: Oh no. I’m so sorry Hermione. *reached out and squeezed Hermione’s hand.*
Neville: What does it mean?
Luna: He’s saying goodbye. This will be his last present.
Ginny: I don’t understand. He’s clearly in love with you. Why would he say goodbye?
Hermione: *buried her face in Luna’s shoulder and sobbed miserably* I don’t know.
Hermione: *put a hand on Luna's shoulder* Luna, are you okay?
Luna: *lifted her head and whispered* You mustn’t let anyone see this, Hermione. NOT EVER!
Hermione: Why not? Is it valuable? More valuable than the necklace?
Luna: *nodded vehemently* The necklace is just jewellery. This is the lost Diadem of Rowena Ravenclaw. It’s one of the most powerful magical artefacts ever made and it’s absolutely priceless. People will kill for it! Rowena charmed it to enhance the wearer’s intelligence and wisdom. Nobody has managed to do that since.
Ginny: Oh great. That’s just what we need – something to make Hermione smarter!
Hermione: *listened to the tape 'H' had sent*"
11,26487928,Luna,Neville,"Luna: So beautiful... and so very sad.
Neville: I don’t get it. What’s the song about?
Luna: It’s not so much the words, or what it was originally intended to be about, but what it means to the person who sent it. This song is deeply significant to him, and it was sent as a last goodbye. That tells us quite a lot really. The symbolism speaks of a life of tragedy, pain and heartbreak... of losing faith and falling into despair... of seeking forgiveness for failing those he loved... and sacrificing everything for those who remain. It implies selflessness, purity of heart, and that he takes the problems of the world upon his shoulders. He puts everyone else before himself, and thinks he deserves no better. Above all it’s a love song. He’s done what he can to ensure a good life for someone he loves, and must now let them go. Their happiness is all he cares about; he expects no happiness for himself. Not in this life anyway. He’s just waiting for death – to be reunited with those he lost, in the afterlife.
Neville: Bloody hell!"
