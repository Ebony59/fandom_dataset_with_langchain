0,26494183,Sirius,Remus,"Sirius: Here we go, *puts the tray down in front of two other men - one around his age wearing a tatty beige suit and the other much younger wearing jeans and a t-shirt.*
Remus: Padfoot, you do know that the legal drinking age is eighteen in the Bahamas?
Sirius: Need some help pulling that stick out of your butt, Moony? Nobody cares about the legal drinking age here, and according to our traditions young... 'James' here is now an adult.
Harry: *leans forwards and whispers urgently* Thanks Padfoot... I mean Dad... but Moony is right. We don't want to get into any trouble or draw attention to ourselves.
Sirius: *glances from Harry to Remus and back to Harry* Seriously? How many years have we been coming to this bar? Everyone here knows it's your seventeenth birthday you prat. Even if they didn't, there is literally a sign above your head. *turns to face the crowd and begins shouting* Hey everyone look! Look! He's an underage drinker! He's only seventeen! Someone call the cops!
Remus: *glaring at Sirius* Did you pay them to do that?
Sirius: *innocently* How could I possibly have known that you two would be total girls' blouses about him drinking in public? Anyway, today is your 'seventeenth' birthday 'James' and we are going to celebrate that properly.
Remus: *sighs* Could..."
1,26494183,Remus,Sirius,"Remus: Did you pay them to do that?
Sirius: How could I possibly have known that you two would be total girls' blouses about him drinking in public? Anyway, today is your 'seventeenth' birthday 'James' and we are going to celebrate that properly.
Remus: Could you stop making air quotes whenever you say 'James' or 'seventeen'! It's a bit of a giveaway.
Sirius: Whatever, Grandma.
Harry: I hate you two; you know that? Where are you picking this stuff up, Dad?
Sirius: I've been learning to speak muggle.
Harry: Stop using the word muggle! What are these drinks anyway?
Sirius: It's a local specialty called a Painkiller; try it.
Harry: What's in it?
Sirius: Rum, pineapple juice, coconut juice and orange juice.
Harry: You know, this drink isn't so bad once your mouth has gone numb.
Sirius: That's the spirit. So H... I mean James, is there any chance of you actually talking to any of these lovely ladies tonight?
Harry: I don't have very much in common with twenty-somethings.
Sirius: Because you're only seventeen, you mean?
Harry: Ha ha, you're hilarious.
Sirius: Well I have no problem talking to them, and I'm almost as old as you. Even Moony had a go and he's practically a monk.
Remus: *scowled at Sirius but didn't deny it*
Harry: the same Maxine that you dated three months ago? That Maxine?
Sirius: Did I? Oh, wait, you're right I did! Okay, maybe not her then. How about... There! Her - that girl who just walked in. How about her? She looks erm... quite nice."
2,26494183,Harry,Rose,"Harry: Can I buy you a drink?
Rose: How can I refuse on your birthday?
Harry: What would you recommend?
Rose: Let's assume that I do.
Harry: One Bahama Mama please Lucas.
Lucas: Your Dad's running a tab.
Rose: Thank you James.
Harry: How did you know my name?
Rose: It said 'Happy 17th Birthday James'.
Rose: This is delicious. I'm Rose. It's nice to meet you James.
Harry: Nice to meet you too, Rose. So what brings you to our little corner of paradise?
Rose: I'm on a gap year, travelling the world.
Harry: On your own?
Rose: Are you asking if I have a boyfriend, James?
Harry: What? No!
Rose: Oh, so you don't care if I have a boyfriend? That seems rather immoral...
Harry: No, that's not what I... I wasn't... I just meant that it's quite dangerous to be travelling on your own.
Rose: I can look after myself, James, but thank you for your concern."
3,26494183,Harry,James,"Harry: I can look after myself, James, but thank you for your concern.
Rose: Aren’t you drinking?
Harry: Oh yes, my drink’s over there.
Harry: I think your friends would like us to join them.
Harry: They’re not my friends, they’re just a couple of stray mutts I can’t seem to shake.
Harry: Get lost, Padfoot.
Sirius: Is that anyway to talk to your dear old Dad?
Rose: Pleasure.
Sirius: You must join us.
Harry: Sure. Rose, please allow me to introduce my Uncle Moony and the sad reprobate who calls himself my father. Moony, Padfoot, this is Rose.
Sirius: Rose! What a lovely name.
Rose: Your wife, you mean?
Sirius: Well she’s no longer with us, unfortunately, but um... yes, James’s mother would of course be my um... wife."
4,26494183,Harry,Rose,"Harry: Apparently, *answered grudgingly*.
Rose: Your wife, you mean?
Sirius: *glanced at Harry* Well she’s no longer with us, unfortunately, but um... yes, James’s mother would of course be my um... wife.
Harry: *kicked Sirius under the table; hard*
Sirius: *emitted a strained squeak and his smile faltered briefly* Well, it was a long time ago.
Rose: I’m so sorry. I didn’t realize.
Sirius: *waved away her concern* It was a long time ago.
Remus: Is that an East Coast accent?
Rose: Yes, I grew up in Vermont.
Remus: That’s a lovely State. Where did you go to high school, if I might ask?
Rose: Oh it was a very small girls’ school in Massachusetts. I’m sure you won’t have heard of it.
Harry: *glared a warning at Remus*
Harry: Where have you been so far on your world tour?
Sirius: No we’re not Australian! Why do Americans always think we’re bloody Australian? We sound nothing like Australians!
Remus: I think Rose is winding us up, Padfoot.
Rose: Sorry, I couldn’t resist.
Sirius: Good one. You got me there! Of course you know this means war?
Rose: Goodness how terrifying. I’m all aquiver.
Sirius: Oh I like her. I like her a lot.
Rose: Do you live here?
Sirius: Yes, Remus: No, Harry: Sort of.
Rose: You don’t need to hide it from me though. I know what’s going on.
Harry: You do?
Rose: Of course. It’s obvious. But it's almost the twenty-first century. Gay couples can be quite open these days.
Sirius: You think we’re gay?!? We’re not gay! Well the jury is still out on Moony, but I’m not gay! Ask any woman here!
Harry: *erupted with laughter*
Moony: *rolled his eyes and sighed in a long-suffering sort of way*
Rose: *raised a disapproving eyebrow at Sirius*"
5,26494183,Harry,Sirius,"Harry: You think we're gay?!? *erupted with laughter*
Sirius: We're not gay! *hesitated for a second* Well the jury is still out on Moony, but I'm not gay! Ask any woman here!
Harry: *still rolling about chortling*
Moony: *rolled his eyes and sighed in a long-suffering sort of way*
Rose: Ask any woman here? Any woman?
Sirius: *suddenly realized what he'd implied* Well... that is to say... I erm...
Harry: *laughed even harder*
Sirius: *scowled*
Remus: I think you might have blown your chances there Padfoot.
Sirius: Bugger. I'm going to the bar.
Remus: Well, I think I'll leave you kids alone. Have fun! *ventured into the crowd*
Harry: That was awesome! Absolutely brilliant!
Rose: *sucked on her straw in wide-eyed innocence*
Harry: Wait! Did you do that on purpose? You didn't really think they were gay?
Rose: Well they do dress in a rather... flamboyant style, and those goatee beards don't do them any favours... but no. I didn't think they were gay. This bar is full of scantily clad women gyrating provocatively, and they were both checking them out. Padfoot's clearly like a dog in heat – he can't help chatting up every woman he meets. Moony is more like a wolf – he hunts his prey from the shadows and then pounces when he sees one separated from the pack. Either way, their prey seems to be exclusively female.
Harry: *glanced over at Moony*
Rose: I was impressed that you weren't checking out the gyrating women, and I thought it would be nice for us to chat without the parentals cramping our style. Unless of course it's you that's gay?
Harry: *grinned at her stupidly* No, I'm not gay. This is a gay bar though. We've been coming here for years and Padfoot still hasn't realized that. Women come here so they can have a good time without being harassed by men. Padfoot thinks his cheesy chat-up lines are the root of his success, but at the end of the night when the women are a bit tipsy, he's one of the only straight men in here. It's like shooting fish in a barrel."
6,26494183,Harry,Rose,"Harry: It was a perfect evening, he realised. Tiny waves were lapping peacefully against the shore, while palm trees rustled quietly in the breeze. They had the beach entirely to themselves. *Harry looked down at the girl clinging to his arm. She sensed his gaze and looked up at him through her eyelashes. A smile pulled at the corners of her mouth. She squeezed his arm even tighter and rested her forehead against his shoulder, sighing in contentment.*
Rose: *Rose looked up at him, her lips parting in surprise. Harry’s other arm encircled her, raising her up on her tip-toes, the curves of her body meshing perfectly with his.* Now that was worth waiting for, she said, with a tone of deep satisfaction.
Harry: Waiting for? *Harry queried. Had she been waiting for him to kiss her? Since when?*
Rose: Yes, *she replied, her eyes twinkling. I wanted my first kiss to be special, and it was.*
Harry: *Harry repeated in his head. Not our first kiss, but her first kiss? His eyes widened.*
Rose: *Rose smiled even wider, Yes, and you did a fine job. I chose well.*
Harry: *Harry was speechless. He lowered her slowly back to the ground.*
Rose: Now don’t go getting a big head. Just because I let you kiss me once doesn’t mean I’ll do it again. You did good on the first one though, so you’re in with a good chance.
Harry: *Harry repeated, somewhat in a daze.*
Rose: Maybe, *she said coyly. Of course you’d have to catch me first.*
Rose: *Rose took off up the beach at a run. Harry stood open-mouthed for a second, and then took off after her. Rose squealed and picked up the pace, laughing and whooping*
Rose: *She didn’t make it easy for him – it took him a good five minutes to catch her. They lay on the sand panting. Harry was draped across her body pinning her hands above her head. She looked into his eyes, her expression full...*"
7,26494183,Harry,Sirius,"Harry: Sorry, was I doing it again?
Sirius: Yes, you were screaming.
Harry: You're going to have to tell her, Harry. You can't keep on like this.
Harry: I can't! She's a muggle. It would violate the Statute of Secrecy! What if she started telling people? Not only would we be exposed, but the entire ICW might come after us.
Sirius: Come on Harry, it's me you're talking to. Everyone who dates a muggle has to violate the Statute of Secrecy at some point. If the muggle blabs they get obliviated, and that's that. Now what's the real reason you don't want to tell her?
Harry: Because I've never met anyone like her, Padfoot! Never! Not in either of my lives. She's perfect!
Sirius: She's not perfect Harry.
Harry: I know she's not perfect! But even her imperfections are perfect imperfections! She's perfect for me! There's not a single thing about her that I'd change. When I'm with her... I'm not just happy, I'm as happy as I can imagine being. You understand? I didn't know it was possible to be this happy.
Sirius: Ah, and you're worried that telling her about magic will change things.
Harry: Of course I'm worried. I'm as happy as it's possible to be. There's only one way to go from there - down!
Sirius: Nice try kiddo, but that's not it either. Tell me the real reason.
Harry: I'm not a kid!
Sirius: Sorry. I keep forgetting that you're not really seventeen."
8,26494183,Sirius,Harry,"Sirius: “Nice try kiddo, but that’s not it either. Tell me the real reason.”
Harry: “I’m not a kid!”
Sirius: “Sorry. I keep forgetting that you’re not really seventeen.”
Harry: “I noticed. Memory is the first thing to go, you know.”
Sirius: “And now you’re trying to change the subject. Why does telling Rose about magic give you screaming nightmares?”
Harry: “Because... what if she reacts like them?”
Harry: “What if she’s repulsed by magic? What if she thinks I’m a freak? I couldn’t bear it! Not from her. Not from my Rose! She means everything to me, Padfoot! Everything! I can’t take that risk.”
Sirius: “So you’re just going to hide it from her for the rest of your life?”
Harry: “Yes! I’ll do whatever it takes!”
Remus: “Rose is a remarkable woman. She might surprise you.”
Harry: *scowled*
Harry: “It took him another few days to work up the courage to actually invite her, but the nightmares were getting worse, so he really didn’t have any choice.”
Harry: “Rose had been delighted to accept his invitation for that evening.”
Harry: “Harry was almost shaking with trepidation when he met Rose at her hotel.”
Harry: “She was wearing a pretty red summer dress with matching shoes and purse. She looked amazing.”
Harry: “Most people probably wouldn’t consider Rose beautiful, but Harry did. To him, she looked prettier every time he saw her.”
Harry: “They took a muggle taxi to the yacht club, where Harry helped Rose into a large speedboat.”
Harry: “Conversation would have been difficult, but Rose seemed content to just hold on and enjoy the ride.”
Rose: *screamed in surprise and delight*
Harry: “For the first time since he’d met her, Rose looked unsettled.”"
9,26494183,Rose,James,"Rose: I’m not really dressed for a jungle hike through razor wire and minefields, James.
James: Oh, don’t worry about the sign. We bought the island off the RBDF and never got around to removing it. Anyway, it helps to keep the tourists away.
Rose: So you removed the razor wire and the land mines?
James: Actually no, but we’ll avoid those areas.
Rose: Do you live in a cave?
Harry: No, there’s a house; it’s just... well hidden.
Rose: Well, there’s something you don’t see every day.
Harry: I have something to confess, Rose... I’m a wizard. We’re all wizards – Padfoot, Moony and me.
Rose: Well obviously. But who cast the Fidelius? That’s a terribly tricky charm.
Rose: The house looks fabulous, James. I love art deco. I’d have worn a flapper dress if I’d known! Honestly, you never tell me anything. Now I’m going to clash with the architecture!
Sirius: Welcome to our humble abode. Is everything okay?
Rose: It is now."
10,26494183,Sirius,Remus,"Sirius: I knew it! *mouth dropped open*
Remus: You're a witch! I sensed it the first time we met. You went to the Salem Witches' Institute, I presume?
Harry: You're a witch? *asked, stupidly*
Rose: Did I not mention that?
Sirius: *burst into roars of laughter*
Remus: *grinned in an annoyingly smug way*
Harry: *tried to be angry, but couldn't do it*
Remus: Come on in. I think James is going to need a minute to catch up.
Rose: Why thank you Moony, that would be lovely.
Remus: You have remarkably good taste, my dear.
Sirius: Apart from liking James of course. I have no idea what that's about.
Rose: *took Harry's arm and gave him a warm smile*
Remus: Shall we go through to the sitting room? We have champagne on ice, in celebration of Rose's first visit to the house.
Sirius: The first person James has ever brought to the house, in fact.
Rose: Then I'm honored; thank you James.
Harry: *punched Sirius in the stomach*
Rose: Is Padfoot okay?
Harry: He's fine. He has stomach cramps from a bad clam.
Remus: *opened the double doors wide to reveal the room beyond*
Rose: Oh my goodness!
Harry: *grinned*"
11,26494183,Rose,Harry,"Rose: It's beautiful.
Harry: Yes well, this is Padfoot's idea of modern.
Sirius: Hey, this is modern!
Harry: *rolled his eyes*
Remus: A toast. To Rose - welcome to our home.
Rose: This is wonderful! Which champagne is it?
Remus: It's from a small champagne house near Epernay. Padfoot and James bought it last year.
Remus: Yes you did. Do you two read any of the reports I give you?
Sirius: Not really.
Harry: Of course!
Sirius: *suggested they adjourn to the terrace*
Harry: What have we got?
Sirius: How far from Voldemort?
Harry: Shit.
Harry: I'm sorry. We have to go. I'll explain when we get back. The elves will get you anything you need.
Sirius: I still don't see why we had to bring that thing back here."
12,26494183,Harry,Sirius,"Harry: I’m sorry. We have to go. I’ll explain when we get back. The elves will get you anything you need.
Sirius: I still don’t see why we had to bring that thing back here.
Harry: Because the snake had nothing to do with the breach. It was the Graphorns that caused the breach. This snake has probably been living peacefully in the area for years.
Sirius: How on earth can you know that?
Harry: Trust me, I know this snake. It’s called Nagini and I would like to ask it a few questions.
Rose: Ah a Maledictus. How fascinating!
Harry: You mean Nagini is a woman?
Rose: Not anymore, but originally yes.
Harry: Is there a cure?
Rose: Not yet.
Sirius: Aren’t we getting a little off-topic?
Harry: Yes we are. Rose, I owe you an apology and an explanation. But... well... it’s rather a long story.
Rose: That’s okay James. We have plenty of time. But I might be able to simplify things a bit.
Hermione: Hello Harry."
