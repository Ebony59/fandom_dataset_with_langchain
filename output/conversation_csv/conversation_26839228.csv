0,26839228,Sirius,Rose,"Sirius: What the hell is going on? Who is this? Where's Rose?
Hermione: I'm sorry Mr Black, but there never was a Rose. It was always me, Hermione Granger. I took some hair from a girl I met on the way here and Polyjuiced myself to look like her.
Remus: But why?
Hermione: Because I wanted to get to know Harry of course. And I wanted Harry to get to know me. But I wanted him to like me for who I am - who I am this time, I mean, not who I was last time.
Hermione: Oh you should see your faces! Honestly Harry, did you think I wouldn't work it out? I'd begun to suspect that you must have come back in time even before you sent me the lost Diadem of Ravenclaw.
Harry: You did?
Hermione: Of course I did! You sent me enough clues! As soon as they gave me a time-turner in third year I began to wonder, because you knew things you could only know if you'd seen the future. That meant you were either a seer or you'd come back from the future. We all know that seers are frauds, so it had to be the latter, and the time-turner proved that time travel was possible.
Harry: Er, well in fact seers can... Actually, never mind. So how did you find us?
Hermione: Harry, I have the Diadem of Ravenclaw. I can think of at least twenty ways I could have tracked you down, but I chose the easiest one - I followed Professor Lupin. In English folklore 'Padfoot' is the name given to a sort of spectral black dog, otherwise known as a Grim. It therefore seemed likely that Mr Black was an animagus who appeared as a Grim when you both escaped from Azkaban. Professor Lupin clearly knew who you were and left Hogwarts to come to find you. Since he knows you better than I, he would know where to look and possibly how to contact you. I suspected he would use muggle transportation, which would baffle most witches or wizards, but I'm muggleborn and he did not hide."
1,26839228,Harry,Hermione,"Harry: But why do all this?
Hermione: I already said! To get to know you! You've been an invisible presence in my life for the last six years Harry. You've been looking out for me, guiding me, protecting me. When you said goodbye last year I was devastated. You left a hole in my life that was too big to fill, and I refused to accept it. I realised that you're more important to me than Hogwarts, so I left to come find you. I needed to find out what sort of person you are, and to understand why you did what you did.
Hermione: I don't mean why you killed Professor Quirrell, she added hastily, seeing his expression. I understand that - it was the only way to kill Voldemort before your health failed. I meant why you did the things you did for me. Everything that's good in my life, I owe to you. So I wanted to see what you're really like and whether you'd like me - not for who I was, or for how I look, but for the person I am now. So I disguised myself, and I knew that you'd probably shy away from talking to a seventeen year old, so I made myself look a bit older. Simple.
Harry: I see. And what did you discover?
Hermione: I discovered that you're a wonderful person. I discovered that you do like me for who I am, and I like you for who you are. But I still don't know why you did what you did for me. To understand that, I need to know what happened between us in your previous life.
Hermione: Please Harry, she whispered. Will you tell me our story?"
2,26839228,Harry,Rose,"Harry: She was a truly wonderful person, heâ€™d always known that. But now heâ€™d learnt it all again, in the shape of Rose. Heâ€™d fallen in love with Rose within minutes of first speaking to her. She was amazing, and now he knew that Rose and Hermione were one and the same, he could see the similarities. But there were differences too. Rose had a calm confidence that Hermione hadnâ€™t developed until she became Minister for Magic. Rose was also more carefree and light-hearted than Hermione had been. All the dark events and near-death experiences in her previous life had apparently stripped her of that, leaving her more serious. *thinking about Hermione and Rose*

Harry: The first time theyâ€™d danced, Harry had been given a glimpse of the life he could have had... if he hadnâ€™t been fighting a war. For a brief moment, all thoughts of Voldemort and Horcruxes had fled his mind. He was just a teenage boy, holding his beautiful best friend in his arms, wondering if she wanted to be more than just friends. But when the song ended, the moment did too. Hermione had walked away, looking bereft and upset. Had she felt guilty? Harry had no idea, but heâ€™d decided it was best to let her deal with whatever she was feeling before he went any further. So heâ€™d carried on as if nothing had happened. *remembering the dance with Hermione*

Harry: Over the next few days Hermioneâ€™s mood had improved enormously. She stopped crying at night and seemed to have forgotten about Ron entirely. They became closer as the weeks passed, and by the time they visited Godricâ€™s Hollow on Christmas Eve, Harry felt like theyâ€™d more or less become a couple. He just needed to find the right moment to kiss her and make it official. *thinking about his relationship with Hermione*

Harry: But that moment never came. Instead, Ron returned. At first Hermione had been furious with Ron, and refused to talk to him. But their goofy ginger friend was full of remorse and Hermione was too nice a person to bear a grudge for long. Soon after that they began teaming up against Harry, just like they had the previous year. *reflecting on Hermione's relationship with Ron*

Harry: In the weeks that followed Harry told himself that heâ€™d been mistaken â€“ Hermione had never felt the same way he did. She saw him as a brother, not a lover. Pretty soon, heâ€™d convinced himself that he only saw her as a sister too. Nothing had happened when they danced, he told himself, or in the months that followed. It had all been a momentary lapse of judgement brought on by the stress of their situation. *trying to convince himself about his feelings for Hermione*

Harry: On that day Hermioneâ€™s last words to him had changed everything. With those final words, he suddenly knew that he hadnâ€™t been mistaken. She had felt the same way. That realisation was the final straw. Voldemortâ€™s insatiable thirst for power had cost Harry his parents, his Godfather, and then the love of his life. The mad bastard had taken away every single person Harry had ever loved. Harry had been pushed beyond endurance and as he sat in the cupboard under the stairs following his return, he had raged at the unfairness of it all. What had he done to deserve such a cruel fate? *reflecting on Hermione's last words and his feelings for her*

Hermione: Tell me the story of us, Harry, she whispered again. *asking Harry to tell their story*

Harry: And so he did. Harry told her the entire story of his first life, because that was the story of them. Hermione had been there for every important moment of it. He left nothing out â€“ he told her everything. *telling Hermione their story*"
3,26839228,Hermione,Harry,"Hermione: You mean there was a basilisk loose in the school?
Harry: How did you figure that out?
Hermione: It's obvious! What else could it be?
Harry: *realized how formidable this version of Hermione might be* No she didn't die, though it was a close thing...
Hermione: Oh no! Please tell me Ginny was okay! She didn't die, did she?
Harry: No she didn't die, *reassured her* Though it was a close thing...
Hermione: No! *exclaimed in horror* Don't tell me the Diary was a Horcrux?
Harry: I'm afraid so, *Harry replied* And it wasn't the only one...
Hermione: No! *whispered, cupping her face in her hands* He made two?
Harry: *shook his head sadly* Not two. Seven.
Hermione: *screamed, and slapped a hand over her mouth* Seven! *mumbled through her fingers* That's... that's... monstrous!
Hermione: But how did you defeat Riddle's spirit then? Only Fiendfyre can destroy a Horcrux, but you were just a second year. And he had your wand?
Harry: That wasn't actually my immediate concern, *Harry replied dryly* because he summoned the Basilisk and ordered it to kill me.
Hermione: You fought a thousand year old Basilisk? *she shrieked*"
4,26839228,Harry,Hermione,"Harry: â€™s spirit then? Only Fiendfyre can destroy a Horcrux, but you were just a second year. And he had your wand!â€�
Hermione: That wasnâ€™t actually my immediate concern,â€� Harry replied dryly, â€œbecause he summoned the Basilisk and ordered it to kill me.â€�
Hermione: You fought a thousand year old Basilisk?â€� she shrieked. â€œIt must have been sixty feet long! And you did it without a wand?â€�
Harry: I did,â€� Harry confirmed, â€œand it was more like seventy feet. Its head was bigger than I was. I wasnâ€™t entirely unarmed though. Fawkes appeared with the Sorting Hat, from which I pulled the Sword of Gryffindor.â€�
Hermione: Fawkes came to your rescue... and he brought a sword? A sword to fight a basilisk? Thatâ€™s insane! Basilisk hide is far too tough! Why didnâ€™t he bring Dumbledore?â€�
Harry: I have no idea. I never thought to ask. Not that Fawkes could have answered... Anyway, I managed to slay the Basilisk by stabbing the sword up through the roof of its mouth.â€�
Hermione: Harry thatâ€™s... thatâ€™s brilliant,â€� she grinned, â€œand also insanely risky! What if youâ€™d been scratched by a fang? Those things are razor sharp and laced with venom.â€�
Harry: So I discovered. One of them pierced my arm and snapped off.â€�
Hermione: But thatâ€™s impossible!â€� Hermione protested. â€œThereâ€™s no cure! Youâ€™d be dead!â€�
Harry: Yeah, I thought I was done for. But Fawkes cried on the wound and healed it up.â€�
Hermione: Phoenix tears!â€� Hermione nodded. â€œOf course!â€�
Harry: Then I stabbed Riddleâ€™s Diary with the fang to destroy the Horcrux.â€�
Hermione: And that worked?â€� Hermione replied, astounded. â€œHow on earth did you know? Iâ€™ve never read that anywhere!â€�
Harry: Just a hunch,â€� Harry replied modestly. â€œFortunately I was right and Riddle scattered into nothing.â€�
Hermione: *shook her head in disbelief while Harry continued his story*.
Hermione: *raised an eyebrow when she heard that none of the Weasley family thanked him for saving their daughter, and seemed very interested to hear that sheâ€™d hugged him so fiercely after she was un-petrified, but otherwise didnâ€™t comment*.
Hermione: *was on the edge of her seat listening to his escapades, though she did (once again) seem to be especially interested in how much sheâ€™d hugged him. Her eyes went as big as saucers when she heard that sheâ€™d kissed him on the top of the head after the second task. The faint smile was wiped from her face when Harry and Cedric were portkeyed to the Hangleton Graveyard, and she cried openly at the news that Cedric was killed*.
Harry: *voice cracked as he told her of his awful fifth year. Dumbledore had told everyone to keep him in the dark, which left Harry isolated and alone*.
Hermione: *listened to his story*"
5,26839228,Hermione,Harry,"Hermione: I'm sorry Harry. I'm so sorry.
Harry: *nods numbly*
Harry: Please Hermione. I had no idea you'd been through so much. Please stop, I've heard enough.
Hermione: Please Harry. I had no idea you'd been through so much. Please stop, I've heard enough."
6,26839228,Harry,Hermione,"Harry: You were inconsolable for weeks. Until that song came on the radio: 'O Children' by Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds. I'd never heard it before, and could make no sense of the lyrics, but somehow it struck a chord. I pulled you onto your feet and forced you to dance with me. For the first time since Ron left, you smiled.
Harry: Hermione was his best friend, not Ron. The more they danced, the more he realised how much she meant to him. Not just as a friend, but as more than that. She was easily the most wonderful person he knew. She was also, he noticed with a start, breathtakingly beautiful. Even wearing heavy boots, scruffy jeans and a lumberjack shirt, with her unwashed hair pulled back in a messy ponytail... she was gorgeous. Her smile lit up the room, and Harry's troubles seemed to just melt away. As the song faded they had danced the last few notes in a close embrace, with their heads resting on each other's shoulders... and something had stirred in Harry's chest.
Harry: He was no longer going out with Ginny, he'd thought, and Hermione was no longer going out with Ron. He'd left them, after all. So it was just the two of them now - Harry and Hermione... fighting a war together... for who knows how long... against terrible odds. Would it be so wrong if something happened between them, he'd wondered... When the song ended they'd pulled apart, looking into each other's eyes. Harry wanted to kiss her, to tell her what he'd realised, to tell her how he felt about her. But he hesitated for the tiniest of moments and missed his chance. Hermione turned away and stalked out of the tent. He watched her go, feeling thoroughly dejected. Did that mean she didn't feel the same way?
Harry: We battled on alone, trying to understand the objects Dumbledore left in his Will, figure out how to destroy the Horcruxes, and uncover the locations of the ones that remained. But we hit a brick wall and in the end we had no choice but to visit to Godric's Hollow, hoping that Bathilda Bagshot might know something useful.
Harry: We didn't realise it until we got there, but it was Christmas Eve.
Hermione: Oh Harry.
Harry: There was snow on the ground. We could hear midnight mass inside the church. It was a hauntingly beautiful night. We saw the remains of my parents' house - the place where they raised me before a madman came to kill us. There's a memorial in the village square. To muggles it looks like an obelisk but to witches and wizards it..."
7,26839228,Harry,Hermione,"Harry: We could hear midnight mass inside the church. It was a hauntingly beautiful night. We saw the remains of my parents' house - the place where they raised me before a madman came to kill us. There's a memorial in the village square. To muggles it looks like an obelisk but to witches and wizards it's a statue of my parents, with my mother holding me in her arms. In the winter, when the snow settles, it looks like they're wearing furry white hats. *sniffs heavily* We found their graves in the churchyard. You conjured a wreath of winter roses and leaned it against the headstone. Then we just stood, you and I, arm in arm in that silent snowy graveyard, honoring my parents' sacrifice. *squeezes Hermione's hands*
Hermione: *staring at the floor and weeping silently*
Harry: I never told you... in all the years that we were friends afterwards, I never told you how much I treasured that moment. I went back there every Christmas Eve after that. I would stand alone at my parents' grave and on the stroke of midnight I'd conjure a wreath of winter roses, just like you did, and wish them Happy Christmas. I talked to them, and to Sirius, and to everyone else we lost. And I remembered the snowy and peaceful Christmas Eve that you and I spent together there, in the middle of a war.
Hermione: *looks up at him with bloodshot eyes*
Hermione: You never took anyone else?
Harry: No. Only you would have understood what it meant to me, but you were with Ron.
Hermione: *asks in a tiny voice* The last time?
Harry: *sighs* I resisted telling Sirius and Remus the whole story for a long time. When I did, I asked Kreacher and Dobby and Winky to join us. I didn't want to have to tell the tale more than once, but it was... difficult... the first time. I was a blubbering wreck for a lot of it. They begged me to stop, but I insisted on getting it all out. I knew that if I stopped I'd never be able to start up again. I wanted them to know."
8,26839228,Harry,Hermione,"Harry: When I did, I asked Kreacher and Dobby and Winky to join us. I didnâ€™t want to have to tell the tale more than once, but it was... difficult... the first time. I was a blubbering wreck for a lot of it. They begged me to stop, but I insisted on getting it all out. I knew that if I stopped Iâ€™d never be able to start up again. I wanted them to know what happened, just as I want you to know. But it took a lot out of me, and afterwards I withdrew into myself. I didnâ€™t speak for months. In the end, Remus insisted that I see a muggle psychiatrist. He brought her here and proved that magic was real. She said I have Post Traumatic Stress Disorder. When she heard my story she said it was no surprise â€“ Dumbledore had basically groomed me to be a child soldier. I killed Quirrell with my bare hands when I was eleven years old, and Dumbledore brushed it off as if it was nothing. Even worse, I later discovered that my mentor, the person I trusted most in the whole world, and who I loved like a grandfather, had left me with child abusers so Iâ€™d willingly walk to my death when the time came.â€�
Hermione: No!
Harry: Iâ€™m afraid so, but weâ€™re not there yet, and that was far from the end of it.
Harry: Harry explained how Bellatrixâ€™s panic at seeing the Sword of Gryffindor told him that one of the Horcruxes was hidden in her vault. So theyâ€™d broken into Gringotts and escaped on the back of a dragon, destroying half the bank in the process.
Hermione: I rode on the back of a dragon?
Harry: Yes you did. I think you enjoyed it even less than the Thestrals... and Buckbeak... and brooms. For someone who hates flying, you did rather a lot of it Iâ€™m afraid.
Harry: Harry described their return to Hogwarts, via enemy-occupied Hogsmeade, in a mad dash to find the next Horcrux before Voldemort could retrieve it. McGonagall and the other professors reclaimed the school and triggered the defences, just as Voldemortâ€™s army arrived outside the grounds.
Hermione: They attacked the school? When it was full of children?
Harry: Yes, We managed to smuggle the younger ones out through a passage to Hogsmeade, but the older ones insisted on fighting. They wanted to buy me the time I needed so we could defeat Voldemort for good. They were incredibly brave, but Voldemortâ€™s army was vast. He had giants, werewolves, Dementors, acromantulas and hundreds of witches and wizards. He laid siege to the school and the defences collapsed. After that the fight was brutal and ugly. Half the school was destroyed.
Harry: How many died?
Hermione: Too many.
Harry: On our side we lost Remus and his wife Tonks, Fred Weasley, Lavender Brown, Colin Creevey, Severus Snape and fifty other students. On their side they lost hundreds. Quite a few pureblood families came to an end that day.
Harry: Hermione shook her head in disbelief as Harry resumed his story. Heâ€™d figured out where the diadem was but got into a fight with Malfoy and his goons in the Room of Requirement. Crabbe was consumed by his own Fiendfyre, while Harry and his friends managed to save Goyle and Malfoy. They were barely free of the flames when the battle found them. Percy made the first joke of his life, just before a massive explosion threw them all from their feet and killed Fred."
9,26839228,Harry,Dumbledore,"Harry: Learning the secrets that Dumbledore had kept from him all those years was a deeply bitter experience. Not only had Dumbledore been raising Harry like a pig for slaughter, but heâ€™d manipulated Harryâ€™s life so that Harry would embrace his death without complaint. *Harry's opinion on Dumbledore's manipulations*
Hermione: Dumbledore wouldnâ€™t do that! He wouldnâ€™t! *Hermione's disbelief and defense of Dumbledore*
Hermione: Do that to a child? Endanger a dozen lives to maintain Snapeâ€™s cover? Itâ€™s unforgivable! He isnâ€™t that cold... or that cruel... Is he? I mean, Crookshanks never liked him... *Hermione's anger and doubt about Dumbledore*
Harry: *Harry made no effort to persuade her. She would either believe him or she wouldnâ€™t. His heart was already breaking at the likelihood that she would never want to see him again once his story was complete. He sighed wretchedly and remained silent.*"
10,26839228,Hermione,Harry,"Hermione: Please continue.
Harry: Finally, I had the truth. Lying with my face pressed into the dusty carpet of the Headmaster's Office where I had once thought I was learning the secrets of victory, I discovered that I was instead learning the secrets of my own defeat. My job was to walk calmly into Death's welcoming arms, disposing of Voldemort's links to life along the way, so that when at last I flung myself across his path, and did not raise a wand to defend myself, the end would be clean, and the job that ought to have been done in Godric's Hollow would be finished. I never thought to question my assumption that Dumbledore wanted me to live. Now I saw that my lifespan had always been determined by how long it took to eliminate all the Horcruxes. Dumbledore had passed the job of destroying them to me... and I in foolish obedience continued to chip away at the bonds tying not only Voldemort, but myself, to life. It was a neat solution, don't you think? How elegant not to waste any more lives, but to give that dangerous task to the boy who had already been marked for slaughter, and whose death would not be a calamity but another blow against Voldemort. Dumbledore thought of everything. He even allowed me to confide his precious secrets to my two best friends, so that they could continue the quest in the event that I died prematurely.
Hermione: *expression was murderous, but she made no comment.*
Harry: As I lay alone in the Headmaster's office, you and Ron seemed a long way off. I felt as though I'd parted from you months ago. The destiny that Dumbledore had secretly mapped out for me sixteen years earlier had finally arrived, and there was no avoiding it. There would be no goodbyes and no explanations, I was determined of that. This was a journey we could not take together, and the attempts you would make to stop me would waste valuable time. Only half an hour remained of Voldemort's cease-fire, so I had to get moving. Since everyone was gathered in the Great Hall, I stumbled numbly through the castle, confident that nobody would stop me. But I was wrong. You were sitting on the stairs, comforting Ron. I didn't see you until it was too late - you'd already noticed me.
Hermione: You knew something was wrong immediately of course. You always knew when I was upset. I didn't even have to tell you why. I just said there was a reason I could hear the Horcruxes; that I'd suspected it for a while, and that I thought you had too. You started crying, because you knew what I meant.
Hermione: *screamed and leapt from the sofa, backing away in dismay.*
Harry: Please no! Not you! You're not a Horcrux!
Harry: I'm afraid so, he intoned numbly. Nagini was not the last horcrux after all, I..."
11,26839228,Harry,Hermione,"Harry: Please no! Not you! You're not a Horcrux! *Harry couldn't bear to look at her. His heart felt like it was breaking in two. Seeing the disgust or pity on her face would undo him completely.*
Harry: I'm afraid so, *he intoned numbly.* Nagini was not the last horcrux after all, I was, and we both knew it. You said you'd go with me, but I refused. I told you to kill the snake, and then Voldemort would be mortal. You hugged me for the last time, and I walked away.
Hermione: I let you go? *Hermione demanded incredulously.*
Harry: You had no choice. It was my task and mine alone. I would never have expected you, or anyone else, to come with me. What purpose would it serve? He would have just killed you.
Hermione: *Hermione growled and turned her face away in disgust,* I shouldn't have let you go at all, never mind go alone!
Harry: Hermione...
Hermione: Would you have let me go? *she demanded angrily.* Alone?
Harry: *Harry tried to keep his expression neutral, but he failed.*
Hermione: Exactly! *Hermione spat.* You would never have done that to me! *She shook her head heatedly.* I'm not sure I like the person I was.
Harry: *Harry felt the need to defend his best friend, even though he was defending her to herself.* You've always been fiercely loyal, Hermione, and in that moment you had to choose between loyalty to me and loyalty to Ron. Going with me would have meant certain death. Staying with Ron would give you a chance at life. You made the right decision.
Hermione: *Hermione was unconvinced,* If I was in love with Ron then maybe it was the right decision. But if I was in love with you, as I suspect I was, then it was the easy decision, and I was a coward.
Harry: You're judging yourself far too harshly! *Harry objected.* You've certainly never been a coward! You're the bravest woman I know. I was a typical Gryffindor back then, always rushing in with no plan and no consideration of the consequences. I wasn't brave, I was reckless and stupid. You, on the other hand, knew exactly what you were getting into. You knew how unlikely it was that we would succeed. You knew what the consequences of failure would be, and how dangerous it was for you to be the muggleborn best friend of the Boy Who Lived. Despite all that, you did it anyway. That's bravery. And we were at war, don't forget. Victory was the most important consideration. Everything else was secondary, and we each had our roles to play. Perhaps you realized in that moment, as I did, that your role was to fight on after I was gone... not to die uselessly by my side. Letting me go was an act of bravery and sacrifice, not cowardice. And if you had been in love with me, well then it was an even more selfless and courageous sacrifice wasn't it?
Hermione: *Hermione huffed dubiously,* Maybe..."
12,26839228,Ginny,Injured girl,"Ginny: It would be alright. *comforting the injured girl*
Injured girl: I just wanted to go home and I didn't want to fight anymore.
Harry: She didn't make it, that little girl. I looked for her afterwards, but she didn't make it. I found her body in the Great Hall.
Harry: Whenever I wonder if I'm doing the right thing, I just think of that little girl. When I killed Quirrell five years ago, I did it for her. When I slaughtered those Death Eaters in Azkaban, I did it for her. When I killed Barty Crouch Jr at the Quidditch World Cup, I did it for her. That girl deserved to live, but these vile scumbags do not. I couldn't give her justice in that world, but I can give it to her in this one. The only exception is Fenrir Greyback – when I tracked him down and removed his head, I did it for Remus and Lavender Brown.
Hermione: Mr Black and Professor Lupin... they don't help you?
Harry: No, I don't want anyone else to have blood on their hands. They help me to maintain the Exclusion Zone, and they were very keen to assist in sending Lucius Malfoy to Azkaban, but that's it.
Hermione: That was you? I read about that on the Daily Prophet. An anonymous tip-off led to the Ministry discovering a cache of dark artefacts in a secret room under Malfoy's Dining Room floor.
Harry: Yes that was us. We also slipped Lucius some Veritaserum just before the Aurors arrived, so he confessed to everything.
Hermione: How did you do that?
Harry: Ah. Well, that's a whole other story. Let's just say that it's unwise to mistreat your house-elf, because if you get tricked into accidentally freeing them, they might come back and spike your food.
Harry: The rest of the Death Eaters who'd avoided prison were not so lucky. I tracked them down and executed them. Malfoy was only spared because he defected in the original timeline. In twenty years, when he's paid for his crimes, he'll have the chance to rejoin his family. The others were irredeemable monsters.
Hermione: Draco was never quite the same after his father was imprisoned. Without his Dad to protect him, and without his supposed standing in the now-extinct Death Eater organisation to intimidate people, he became a bit of a laughing stock. The crimes his Dad admitted to were so shocking that even his Slytherin friends had to distance themselves, so he pretty much keeps himself to himself. I never read about those deaths in the Prophet though...
Harry: I made them look like accidents. They were only reported in the Obituary section, but I'm sure it didn't go unnoticed in Death Eater circles...
Hermione: What's the Exclusion Zone?
Harry: In his current form Voldemort is, as he put it to me in the Little Hangleton Graveyard, 'as powerless as the weakest creature alive'. All he can do is 'force himself, sleeplessly, endlessly, second by second, to exist'. Only one power remains to him – he can possess the bodies of others. But he dare not go where humans are plentiful for fear that Aurors are still searching for him. So he..."
13,26839228,Harry,Voldemort,"Harry: In his efforts to avoid death, he's consigned himself to a living hell. In some ways it's a fitting punishment for killing my parents; maybe even worse than Azkaban, but it's not enough. He deserves no mercy, and is thoroughly unworthy of our sympathy. He's a depraved sociopath who lacks the tiniest shred of decency. He kills, tortures and corrupts those around him for his own amusement. While he lives, the entire world is at risk. But I don't know how to kill him. There must be a way, otherwise he wouldn't hide in fear like he does, but I haven't figured out what it is. Nor has Dumbledore, I guess, or he'd have done that instead of offering me up as a human sacrifice.
Hermione: But don't you have to destroy the Horcruxes before destroying his spirit?
Harry: I don't think so. By his own admission, he has to force himself to exist. If the Horcruxes were enough to keep him alive that wouldn't be the case. I also think his choice of words is important. He said 'exist' not 'live'. If he stops trying to sustain himself, I don't think he'll die, I think he'll cease to be.
Hermione: But isn't that worse? Why would he go to all this trouble to avoid death, only to willingly cease to exist instead? Surely he'd try even harder to avoid that?
Harry: I can only speculate, but I wonder if his fear of death isn't so much a dread of dying as a dread of what comes after. Nobody ever really talks about it, but the magical world knows a lot more about the afterlife than the muggle world does. Witches and wizards know with absolute certainty, for example, that souls exist. As a result, we know for sure that there actually is an afterlife. Now put yourself in the shoes of a young Tom Riddle, who's spent his entire life terrorising others and committing all manner of evil. Having grown up in a muggle orphanage he'd be well acquainted with the concept of Heaven and Hell. Then he goes to Hogwarts and discovers that there is definitely an afterlife. He would surely conclude that he was destined to burn in hell. Faced with an eternity of torment in the afterlife, he sets about finding a way to avoid death. But should that endeavour fail, he would rather cease to exist than be consigned to an eternity of suffering.
Hermione: Good heavens! No pun intended. But what if you're wrong?
Harry: Well that would be a bummer, because destroying all the Horcruxes would be a bit tricky. We got rid of five of them, and even figured out how to remove a Horcrux from an object without destroying it, but there's one left, he pointed to his scar, and the only way..."
14,26839228,Harry,Hermione,"Harry: But what if you're wrong? *pulled a face*
Harry: Well that would be a bummer, because destroying all the Horcruxes would be a bit tricky. We got rid of five of them, and even figured out how to remove a Horcrux from an object without destroying it, but there's one left, *he pointed to his scar*, and the only way to destroy that one is to kill me.
Hermione: No! *gasped, flinging herself at him and attaching herself to his chest like a limpet.*
Harry: *wrapped his arms around her*, Don't worry, as long as Voldemort is safely contained within the Exclusion Zone, that won't be necessary. But if a magical creature happened to cross his path he might gain some strength, or even some magical ability. That would be disastrous. So we've set up a massive network of charms around the forest where he's hiding. Muggle repelling charms, animal repelling charms, protective enchantments, concealment charms... and intruder charms linked to a caterwauling charm here. That's what you heard earlier. If anything larger than a mouse gets within ten miles of Voldemort we grab our dragonhide robes and head over there to deal with it. Tonight was a Class 4 incursion, which means a XXXX magical creature had breached the barrier - in this case a family of Graphorns. We don't know if Voldemort has the strength to possess something like that, but nor do we want to find out. We herded them away from him, out of the Zone, and another twenty miles beyond. While we were doing that we stumbled on Nagini, so I stunned her and brought her back.
Hermione: *nodded*, I assumed as much. *looked pensive*
Harry: Dumbledore isn't like the rest of us, Hermione. He doesn't realize how cruel his actions will feel to others. He thinks dying is just the beginning of another grand adventure. He doesn't fear it and has little sympathy for those who do. He wouldn't view that password as a knife to the gut, like we do. He'd just see it as a clever way to conceal a secret until the time was right for me to figure it out. Regardless, the snitch opened and the Resurrection Stone inside brought forth the ghostly spirits of my parents, along with Sirius and Remus. They told me I'd been really brave, that they were proud of me, and that I was nearly done. I asked if it hurt, to die, and Sirius said it was as easy as falling asleep.
Hermione: *gasped*"
15,26839228,Dumbledore,Voldemort,"Harry: Dumbledore was gambling on Voldemort's vanity driving him to complete what he'd started sixteen years earlier, along with my uncanny good luck to ensure that I didn't die some other way first. On the other hand, the fact that Dumbledore kept risking my life unnecessarily along the way suggests that, despite his protests to the contrary, he firmly believed that the prophecy would ensure my safe arrival at the final battle. Either that or he didn't care about me at all. He did once describe caring for me as a trap after all - a flaw in his brilliant plan. Maybe he managed to talk himself out of caring about me? He certainly avoided me like the plague in fifth year, and again in sixth year, apart from our ridiculous 'private lessons' that is. The only person he seemed to care about was Draco Malfoy, for some reason.

Harry: We thought Delphi was safely locked up in Azkaban, but we were wrong. I can't believe we were so stupid! The Dementors betrayed us every time Voldemort snapped his fingers. Why would his daughter be any different? They set her free along with a bunch of others. By the time we figured out what she was up to, Theodore Nott had built her another time-turner and she'd disappeared into the past. We'd destroyed the only one we had, so we had no way to follow. Within hours people started to vanish. Delphi was changing the past again. Our children were the first to go. They just faded away and were gone, as if they'd never existed.

Hermione: *stares at him in wide-eyed horror*

Harry: Members of the Order and the DA went next - Mr and Mrs Weasley, Shacklebolt, Charlie, Neville, Luna, Ginny and the rest. The other you guessed that Delphi had probably gone back to 1997 and told Voldemort what the future had in store. He must have abandoned his search for the Elder Wand and returned to the UK to wipe out his enemies instead. The Order and the DA were all being watched you see; he knew exactly where they were. He must have found Shell Cottage soon after, because Bill, Fleur and Ron went next. Pretty soon you and I were the only ones left, because back in the past we were on the run. Nobody knew where we were, so it was hard for them to kill us, but it was only a matter of time. The fabric of our reality was starting to fray. Objects were disappearing and buildings were falling into dust. Whatever Delphi was doing, it was changing everything. It wouldn't be long before our timeline simply ceased to exist.

Harry: It was you who realised what had to be done. It was the only thing we could do really. There was no way to send anyone back in time without a true time-turner, but you knew of a ritual that would send someone's consciousness back. It was a one-way trip of course, but in the circumstances that didn't seem to matter. I argued strongly that it should be you, but you refused. You pointed out that whoever went back would have to defeat Voldemort, and only I could do that. You created an insanely complicated runic circle and stuck me in the middle of it. You hugged me fiercely, then stepped outside the circle and started chanting. I barely had time to get my head around what was happening when you went suddenly quiet. The Ministry building around us began to crumble. You gave me such a look of sorrow and regret. I'll never forget it. Then you mouthed three words to me and jabbed your wand into the runes. They exploded into life, and I felt pain like nothing I've ever felt. When I woke, I was in the cupboard under the stairs at number four Privet Drive."
16,26839228,Harry,Hermione,"Harry: I want to talk to you, *Harry fell silent, his story at an end.*
Hermione: I know what you're thinking, Harry. You're thinking I'll be horrified that you're breaking the law and dispensing vigilante justice. *Hermione said nothing for the longest time. When she eventually spoke her voice was gravelly from crying.*
Harry: *Harry nodded mutely.*
Hermione: You're forgetting all the times I did the same. I set a professor on fire because I thought he was trying to kill you. I used a time turner illegally to free a convicted murderer. I kept Rita Skeeter imprisoned in a jar for months. I arranged for Umbridge to be abducted by murderous centaurs... I may not have done those things in this timeline, but I'm largely the same person. I understand the need for direct action when the alternative is worse.
Harry: *Silence stretched between them. Harry was too overwhelmed to respond.*
Hermione: The three words I mouthed to you, Hermione said suddenly, they were 'I love you' weren't they?
Harry: *Harry's voice had deserted him. He just stared at the floor and nodded.*
Hermione: Then why was I with Ron? I don't understand. I've never had anything in common with Ron. In fact, he's always been perfectly horrid towards me! He doesn't have any admirable qualities...
Harry: *Harry shrugged, I don't know. Girls are a mystery to me. But Ron wasn't that bad. He may have been a bit... unreliable, but he almost always came through in the end.*
Hermione: Well, I need to know! Hermione declared firmly.
Harry: *That made no sense at all. Huh? he grunted.*
Hermione: I got together with Ron... to be near you. *Hermione looked pensive for a few moments, and then her mouth opened in an 'Oh' of understanding.*
Harry: *Harry asked, struggling to ignore how much Hermione looked like a princess.*
Hermione: I was in love with you from the moment you saved me from the troll, but I didn't know it. For one reason or another, neither of us ever made the connection. We thought we were just friends, and whenever it seemed to be more than that we just put it down to relief that we'd survived some near-death experience. We did that so often that we started to recast our love as more of a brother-sister thing because that was the only way to make sense of it. But that was stupid. A brother-sister thing doesn't happen in those circumstances. I was in love with you but I'd subconsciously categorized you as off-limits, so I fixated on the person who'd keep me closest to you instead – Ron. Then you did the same thing – once I started to show an interest in Ron you suddenly developed an interest in his sister Ginny, to ensure that you were always near me. The only time we ever came close to realizing the truth was when we were alone in that tent in the Forest of Dean. The 'O Children' song came on and we danced, knowing in our hearts how we truly felt. But when it ended..."
17,26839228,Hermione,Rose,"Hermione: I have to wonder though, why did I name my daughter Rose? I called myself Rose because I was thinking of you and your mother. Did I call my daughter Rose for the same reason? Was I thinking of you? Was it to remind me of that Christmas Eve in Godricâ€™s Hollow, perhaps? Or was it to send you a message â€“ that I hadnâ€™t forgotten what happened?
Harry: *His mouth went bone dry. That had never occurred to him. Of course it hadnâ€™t! Only Hermione would think of something as convoluted as that. Was it possible though? Had she been trying to tell him that sheâ€™d felt the same â€“ that she loved him? Had he just been too stupid to get the message?* Iâ€™m pretty sure that only you would think of that. Weâ€™re not all geniuses like you, you know.
Hermione: A genius? Hardly! In five years of receiving birthday gifts from you, it never occurred to me â€“ not even once â€“ to tie a letter to Hedwigâ€™s leg to write back to you.
Harry: Yeah that is pretty stupid.
Hermione: *slapped him playfully across the shoulder* Harry! Donâ€™t be so mean!
Harry: Sorry.
Hermione: You said that Ron and I named our son Hugo. Did we ever say why?
Harry: No, I donâ€™t think so. It was your choice though, Iâ€™m sure of that. Ron wanted to name him Gordon Horton Granger-Weasley after the keeper for the Chudley Cannons, but you put your foot down.
Hermione: *pulled a face* Gordon Horton? Ugh! And I insisted on double-barrelling our surnames did I? That's interesting. Anyway, if Hugo was my choice, then I think I know why. You see, Victor Hugo is my favourite French poet. The name Victor would have been out of the question of course, given the whole Viktor Krum debacle...
Harry: *guffawed* Merlin yes! Ron would have gone berserk if youâ€™d suggested that!
Hermione: Quite. Well, setting aside the possibility that I called my son Hugo as a private joke at Ronâ€™s expense, there is another, more likely, possibility. Victor Hugoâ€™s most famous poem is called â€˜Demain dÃ¨s l'aubeâ€™ which means â€˜Tomorrow at Dawnâ€™. Itâ€™s about him visiting his daughterâ€™s grave. She was nineteen years old and pregnant when she died. She drowned in fact, and her husband died trying to save her. It was all terribly sad. Anyway, the English translation goes something like this: Tomorrow, at dawn, at the moment when the land whitens, I will leave. You see, I know that you wait for me. I will go by the forest, I will go by the mountain. I cannot stay any longer, far away from you. I will walk eyes fixed on my thoughts, Seeing nothing outside, not hearing a noise, Alone, unknown, back hunched, hands crossed, Sorrowed, because the day for me will be like night. I will not look at the golden evening that falls, Nor the faraway sails descending upon Harfleur. And when I arrive, I will put on your tomb A bouquet of green holly and heather in bloom.
Hermione: *Her eyes were glistening as she finished. Harry stared at her, struck mute by the parallels between the poem and their brief time alone together.* I donâ€™t think thatâ€™s a coincidence, Harry. In fact, I..."
18,26839228,Hermione,Harry,"Hermione: I don't think that's a coincidence, Harry. In fact, I'm certain of it. I can think of no other reason why I would name my son Hugo. I like Victor Hugo's work a lot, but in this life I wouldn't name my son after him. Something must have happened in my other life to make Victor Hugo much more significant to me, and that poem leapt into my head the moment you said the name Hugo. I think that calling my son Hugo was a reminder to myself - a reminder of the day we visited your parents' grave... when the land was white... and I laid a bouquet of flowers upon their tomb. And if I was thinking like that for Hugo, then I was probably thinking like that for Rose too. So you see Harry, there can be no doubt. I named both my children in remembrance of you and of our time together. I was, without question, completely in love with you.
Harry: *stares at Hermione, struck mute by the parallels between the poem and their brief time alone together*
Hermione: *holds his gaze, daring him to disagree*
Harry: *turns his head away to hide his tears, but has to wipe his eyes on his sleeves*
Hermione: Thank you for telling me our story, Harry. Sometime I'll tell you the story of my life - the life you gave me, I mean. But for now I want you to know something. I've learned a lot about you over the last few weeks, and even more now that you've told me of your previous life. I know enough to know that you think I'm going to be horrified by what you've told me. You think I'll run a mile because you've killed people, in the previous reality and in this one. We can talk in detail about why that's not the case some other time, but for now I just want to reiterate that I understand, okay? I understand why you did what you did, and I'm not going anywhere.
Hermione: *switches to French, clearly quoting from something* Vois-tu, je sais que tu m'attends et je ne puis demeurer loin de toi plus longtemps.
Harry: *doesn't know what it means, but it sounds beautiful and sad*
Hermione: *repeats it in English* You see, I know that you wait for me and I cannot stay any longer, far away from you.
Hermione: *cups her hands on his cheeks and kisses him firmly on the lips*
Harry: *completely freezes*"
19,26839228,Harry,Rose,"Harry: It didnâ€™t feel wrong at all. It felt very very right. Now he knew that Rose was actually Hermione, everything made sense. Thatâ€™s why heâ€™d been drawn to her the moment he saw her! Thatâ€™s why heâ€™d fallen head over heels in love with her so quickly. Thatâ€™s why it felt so incredible when he kissed her â€“ because Rose was Hermione, and his soul recognised her, even if he didnâ€™t. *realization and thoughts about Hermione*

Hermione: You have given me many wonderful gifts, Harry. But the greatest by far was the gift of knowledge. Bathilda Bagshotâ€™s book was a revelation, as was the Room of Requirement. Both gave me insights and resources I never would have had otherwise. You introduced me to Ginny and Luna, each of whom brought something unique and precious to our merry band of misfits. Ginny, in particular, never would have become my friend if not for your introduction. She could fit in anywhere, and had no need of a group like ours. And yet she joined us, because of the curious mystery of who you were. It was she who brought us slowly into the mainstream of the school, bridging the divide between us and the rest of the student body. My first year at Hogwarts was characterised by loneliness and isolation, but in subsequent years I was increasingly welcomed as a valued and popular member of the school. *expressing gratitude and appreciation to Harry*

Hermione: Ginny and Luna helped me to develop the people skills and emotional intelligence to properly understand others, and to better understand myself. The Arithmancy and Runes texts that you sent contained notes and theories that vastly accelerated my understanding of all branches of magic. Even Crookshanks made a tremendous difference to my personal and professional development, with his calming influence and sixth sense for who I could trust. He taught me that people are not always what they seem. Iâ€™m far from infallible, and have a great deal yet to learn, but Iâ€™m confident that I understand the world, and the people in it, much better than most. I have knowledge and wisdom far beyond my years. Of all the things youâ€™ve given me, those gifts are the most valuable, because knowledge and wisdom are the skills through which a person can bring happiness to their life. If you can correctly perceive the motivations and aspirations of those around you, then you can speak openly to those people, without fear of rejection or ridicule. *expressing gratitude and sharing personal growth*

Hermione: *runs her fingers across Harry's cheek and smiles at him softly* And that is why I have no fear of telling you that I love you.

Harry: *freezes* *thoughts about Hermione's confession and realization of her plan*

Harry: It was a clever and manipulative trap â€“ a plot worthy of... *thoughts about Hermione's plan*"
20,26839228,Hermione,Harry,"Hermione: I loved you in our last life together, but I love you even more in this one. I won't be stupid enough to let you get away again! Ginny's always stealing my stuff, but she won't get to steal you this time! *she dragged him to his feet and pulled him across the room to the fireplace*
Hermione: Your first life was filled with tragedy, sacrifice and war. Your second life began the same way. But you've done enough Harry. You've done more than enough. Nobody should have to sacrifice as much as you have. The life that you glimpsed when we danced in the Forest of Dean is within your grasp. Reach out Harry. Reach out and take it. Stop putting everyone else first and allow yourself some happiness for a change. *she explained, and pressed the play button*
Hermione: We have finally found each other, Harry, and we owe it all to this song. If this song hadn't played on the radio in that tent, you wouldn't have been inspired to dance with me, and we would never have realized how we really felt about each other. So dance with me Harry. Dance once more to our song, and let's finish what we started in that tent. *she wrapped her arms around him and pulled him close*
Harry: *by instinct, he wrapped his arms around her and squeezed her tight*"
