0,272028,Draco,Hermione,"Draco: I thought you'd understand.
Hermione: You thought I'd understand? That you could just propose to me, and then—not even a week later—change your mind?
Draco: Hermione, be reasonable. My parents threw a fit. Threatened to disown me, if you'll believe it. They'll come round. It'll just take time.
Hermione: Your parents. You know, that's what makes it worse. If it was you, I could live with it. Perhaps you felt it was too soon, perhaps you felt that marriage wasn't quite right for you, perhaps you'd decided that we just don't work. But, no, it's your parents. Yet again. Your parents, who have been trying to drive us apart for the last three years, who've felt like the invisible third party in our entire so-called relationship.
Hermione: I could wait for a long time, if it was for you. But it isn't. This is about your parents and how I don't think you'll ever find the courage to do what you want. About how I'll always come second, to them. I can't even blame them, because it's you who's done it, in the end. I'm sorry, Draco, but I can't be in this relationship any more. We're over.
Draco: Hermione, please—"
1,272028,Draco,Draco's mother,"Draco: I've had a few items brought out for your perusal.
Draco's mother: Certain items require refurbishing and repair. I thought it would be best to consult with you, if there were certain pieces you would prefer.
Draco: *picks up a silver bracelet*
Draco's mother: If you need time, you have the afternoon to do this at your leisure. Draw up a list and leave it on the table. *walks out of the library*
Draco: *turns his attention to the other, more mundane works*
Draco: Through these pieces, he could already see the outline of his future wife: she would agree to be lovely, faithful, and have her life's ambitions whittled down to being Draco Malfoy's wife. The contract they would sign will say that, should they separate and she not return his gifts, he can sue for breach of contract. His will be a marriage defined by feet of parchment and cost of legal contracts, and he will buy his bride with Malfoy gold.
Draco: *finds his eyes stealing back towards the other, unsuitable pieces* The torc was compelling, speaking of gifts in battle. Someone who was no stranger to the wilderness would have appreciated the bracelets and the sapphire ring. The diamond pendant would be the expression of one's love for another, as it would have sealed his wife's wounds at the cost of his own magic. Hermione would have loved the circlet."
2,272028,Draco,Hermione,"Draco: Draco. Draco! *Something brushed against the edges of his shields, and then the fire burst away. Hermione stood before him, and he wasn't sure if he was glad or terrified to see her. Her face was smudged with soot, and ashes flickered behind her. Her wand was raised, keeping the flames at bay.* Get up, she said. *She yanked on his arm and he tried to rise. Then he slipped into unconsciousness.*
Draco: *When he woke up in St. Mungo's, his parents were there. His mother looked worried and relieved, and even his father unbent enough to look concerned. There was no sign of Hermione.* Where is she? *When he demanded to know where she was, his parents looked at each other in surprise. After a moment, his mother said that they were not aware that Miss Granger had been there at all. Anxiety threatened to eat him alive until a summoned nurse told him that Hermione had been brought in, but was discharged in the middle of the night.*

Draco: *He spent his recovery time reading The Daily Prophet, combing between the lines for news of Hermione, and composing letters that he never sent.* Dear Hermione... *It kept company with the letters, which all started with 'Dear Hermione' and ended in various ways that even he recognized as depressing.*

Draco: *They stood together by the verandah's marble balustrade, corralled and abandoned by interfering parents. From their vantage point, they could see faerie lights glitter above the twilight-shrouded garden party, as various members of pure-blood families and their attendant children mingled on the lawn. He and Astoria talked about inconsequential events and their lives since school, ignoring the fact that both of them knew what matrimonial game was supposed to be going on.* Astoria was very polite and very pretty, but the conversation was stilted and dull. *Draco was tempted to chalk it up to her, but he heard his own wooden remarks. He watched her fingers whiten as they wrapped around the marble balustrade, a gesture that mirrored his numb grip on his wineglass. Whatever was going on inside Astoria's mind was a mystery to him, but one thing was certain: neither of them wanted to be there at all.*

Draco: *He spotted her in a Ministry break-room long after hours. As he suspected, he was not the only one who had developed a bad habit of working late. Through the window, he watched her fighting with a newfangled mechanical tea-maker, one which was notorious for brewing over-steeped rubbish, and wrested her prize from its magic-infused mechanical grip. She took a sip and made a face, dousing it with milk. The motion was so familiar that his heart ached.* She retreated back to the table and sat down, not bothering to turn her chair so that she could face her work. She sipped her tea and stared at the wall. Her papers were scattered over the top of the battered table, which was scarred and stained from the passage of a thousand of teacups and soggy sandwiches. Her hair was a haystack and there were dark circles under her eyes. She looked half-dead."
