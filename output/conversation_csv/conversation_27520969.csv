Ron: Blimey, Hermione. I donâ€™t know. Like an of-age witch?
Harry: Of course. You always do.
Harry: You do?
Harry: I donâ€™t care if you follow those potions instructions, Harry. But there are dark spells scribbled into the margins and I just - Iâ€™m worried.â€� She stepped closer and took his hand. â€œYou may know people, Harry, but I know books. Please, donâ€™t trust that thing.â€�"
1,27520969,Hermione,Harry,"Hermione: I don't care if you follow those potions instructions, Harry. But there are dark spells scribbled into the margins and I just - I'm worried. *She stepped closer and took his hand.* You may know people, Harry, but I know books. Please, don't trust that thing.
Harry: *watched her for a long moment before nodding slowly.* Alright. We'll get rid of the book.
Hermione: *smiled in response and she truly was stunning.*
Ron: *was stuck carrying Lavender's drink and purse as he followed her around. He glared enviously over his shoulder at Harry and Hermione as they snuck snacks off the platters.*
Hermione: How long do you reckon we have to wait before we can sneak back out?
Hermione: *pursed her lips and looked around the party.* Technically, hardly anyone even knows we're here. So, probably awhile.
Harry: *made a face.* Should we make an appearance?
Hermione: Probably a good idea.
Harry: *grabbed Hermione's hand.* Perfect. No one can talk to us, but everyone will see.
Hermione: Wait - what?
Harry: *led Hermione out onto the middle of the dance floor and spun her into his arms.* You can't dance! *she protested.*
Harry: *frowned in fake confusion and seamlessly twirled the two of them around.* I can't? Then what on earth are we doing right now? *Harry waltzed Hermione into Daphne Greengrass who scowled at them over her shoulder.* Oops. Sorry! *He inelegantly pulled Hermione and himself out of Daphne and Theo Nott's space. Hermione was laughing into his shoulder.* Okay, *he agreed with a nod,* maybe you're right. *Hermione didn't stop laughing. Harry watched her as he swayed them back and forth.* Having fun?
Hermione: *looked up, face flushed, and nodded.* I am, thank you. Tonight has been lovely.
Harry: *eyes twinkled as he smiled.* It has, hasn't it? We can stay longer if you like?
Hermione: *shrugged.* Whatever's fine. *Harry nodded.*
Hermione: *cried all night when he started dating Ginny. Ron held her and called whoever had hurt her a good for nothing git. He didn't realize it was Harry.*
Hermione: *distanced herself from Harry whenever he was with Ginny. She spent more time in the library than she had since third year while doing too many classes and trying to win Buckbeak's case. Sometimes she skipped meals but Ron picked up on it instantly. He would either drag her down to the Great Hall or sneak the two of them into the kitchens. Ron was an angel. Hermione didn't think he knew what was happening exactly, but she thought he was starting to catch on.*
Hermione: *tried not to feel like she'd won some sort of battle when Harry stayed at Hogwarts for Easter Hols. She didn't know if Ginny said something, but Harry refused to leave Hermione on her own.*
Ginny: *called Hermione a tramp after Harry broke up*"
2,27520969,Hermione,Harry,"Hermione: Hey, 'Mione.
Hermione: *pressed her face into his neck* *didn't say anything*
Harry: Miss me that much, huh?
Hermione: *pulled back and stared seriously into his eyes* *licked her lips* I always miss you.
Harry: *eyes widened* *breath shallowed*
Hermione: *smiled weakly* *pulled his arms tighter around her and drew her in close to him* *pressed their foreheads together* *breathed in the presence of the other* *neither moved until Moody threatened to hex them both*

Remus: So, he finally figured it out?
Hermione: *raised her eyebrows at the Marauder beside her* I beg your pardon?
Remus: *glanced sidelong at Hermione* *said, 'She had no clue until her soul mark showed up.'*
Hermione: *played with the hem of her dress* And that... that didn't upset James?
Remus: *smiled fondly and shook his head* Nah, James always knew it would be her. Not much could discourage James Potter. Besides, Potters are notorious for finding their soulmates young. I wasn't surprised Harry had become best friends with his own.
Hermione: *looked down at her lap* But he didn't like me. Not like that. I'm... I'm like an afterthought.
Remus: *studied the young witch beside him for a long moment* I wouldn't be so sure.
Hermione: *looked up, her brown eyes meeting her ex-professor's golden ones* Do you think?
Remus: *shrugged* You tell me. How did he react?
Hermione: *smiled*
Remus: *patted her hand* Take good care of him. He's far more reckless than James ever was.
Hermione: *smiled teasingly at the werewolf* I find that very hard to believe. James had you and..."
3,27520969,Remus,Hermione,"Remus: Do you think? *shrugged* You tell me. How did he react?
Hermione: *smiled*
Remus: *patted her hand* Take good care of him. He's far more reckless than James ever was.
Hermione: *teasingly* I find that very hard to believe. James had you and Sirius at his side, after all.
Remus: *raised an eyebrow* Yes, *agreed at length* and Harry has Ron and yourself. I've yet to decide which is worse.
Remus: *choked on his drink*
Hermione: It's not in here, *exclaimed* I've checked everything. Twice! *slammed the book shut and paced up and down the length of their bigger on the inside tent.*
Harry: Look, clearly the books aren't helping, *tried to reason.*
Hermione: *spun around* Aren't helping? They're books, Harry. That's what they're supposed to do! What good is a book if it doesn't bloody well help!
Harry: *closed the distance between them in an instant* It's going to be okay, *whispered.*
Hermione: *tensed and stilled* We're going to figure this out.
Harry: *wrapped his hands around her waist and pulled her close* I wish I had something for you — anything.
Hermione: *curled her fingers around the fabric of his shirt* I know.
Harry: *pressed his lips to her head* I love you.
Hermione: *smiled into his chest* I know.
Ron: Oi! *scowled* I'm not going back out to get more wood. If you two want to keep being cute then go outside.
Harry: *saluted*
Hermione: *rolled her eyes and smiled*
Hermione: *laughed* How did you even get these? *tossed half of the cracker aside.*
Ron: *scoffed* Magic, obviously.
Hermione: *rolled her eyes*
Harry: *nuzzled her neck from behind and whispered* When we went to the muggle village for supplies the other day.
Hermione: *nodded and made an 'o' with her mouth*
Ron: *pointed at Harry* No telling secrets! Come on, mate. Who's side are you on?
Hermione: *gloated* I think your question answered itself.
Ron: *gasped and held a hand to his chest dramatically*
Harry: *shrugged* Sorry, mate.
They laughed."
4,27520969,Hermione,Ron,"Hermione: I think your question answered itself, she gloated. *Ron gasped and held a hand to his chest dramatically.*
Harry: *shrugged* Sorry, mate.
Ron: Traitor.
*They laughed.*

Harry: What's wrong?
Hermione: I want to go to Godric's Hollow.
Ron: *paused mid-clean-up* I've been thinking the same thing.

Harry: Hey, *as he set the tray on the side table*.
Hermione: *leaning back against his chest* Hungry?
Harry: You need to eat something.
Hermione: *shaking her head* Tyrant.
Harry: *kissing her temple* I'm not giving you coffee on an empty stomach. Now eat your fruit.
Hermione: *popping a grape into her mouth* I love you.

Hermione: No! Harry...
Ron: Hermione, come on. Please.
Hermione: No...no...
Harry: *getting slapped by Hermione* Don't you ever do something like that to me again, Harry Potter.
Hermione: Don't 'Hermione' me, Harry James.
Harry: Did you just middle name me?
Hermione: Don't you want to know where I was, at least?
Harry: Where you were?
Hermione: Oh, you mean, when you said you were working and would have therefore been in the massive attack that the rebel Death Eaters just enacted on the ministry and made me think you had died when you didn't contact me immediately afterward? Where you were instead of doing what you had told me you would be doing today?
Harry: *trying not to grimace* Yes."
5,27520969,Hermione,Harry,"Hermione: Where were you? *cocked her hip and raised an eyebrow*
Harry: Getting this. *pulled something out of his pocket*
Hermione: *narrowed her eyes at Harry before untying the drawstring and emptying the small item out onto the palm of her hand* It was my mother's.
Harry: I want you to wear it. *looked at Hermione*
Hermione: *tried not to cry, pursed her lips and looked away* Is that your attempt at a romantic proposal, Mr. Potter?
Harry: *stepped closer, ducked his head so his face was close to hers, and traced his fingers along her sides* Depends, is it working?
Hermione: *couldn't stop the smile that spread across her lips* I love you.
Harry: *grinned* Is that a yes?
Hermione: *finally met his gaze again* It's an 'if you make me think you're dead for a third time, the ring comes off.'
Harry: *nodded reasonably* I can live with that."
