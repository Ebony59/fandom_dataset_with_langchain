0,27977304,Voldemort,Percy,"Voldemort: Percy? Pete? Petty, maybe - whatever the rat's name was - well, he was rather useful. He would probably be rewarded, as soon as he could kill the Potter baby, and return back - oh, and the woman. He had to spare the woman, he reminded himself, because he really did not want to deal with whatever emotional breakdown Severus would experience otherwise. *whispers the simplest of unlocking charms, and he's inside* Just like that.
Voldemort: He's made his stance clear, he feels, and this is war. They're on different sides. They chose different sides. Its nothing personal. Its just, an obstacle to him, a minor thorn, which he will remove. After all, he is a soldier, a warrior, and there's almost nothing he's better at than killing.
Voldemort: *pauses a moment, looking through the window* is that Regulus Bla - no, of course not, he concedes, unclenching. *sees his brother, Sirius Black* Right, Voldemort knows all about this friendship. Too much, in fact. James Potter and Sirius Black. Who hasn't heard of it? His death eaters, even the more sensible ones, talk about it constantly, albeit complaining. Its frankly tiring.
Voldemort: *thinks for a moment or two* Maybe one of them is Black's. His mind wanders on the possibility that this is the Longbottom child, they all run in the same Gryffindor circle, but really, how much does it matter? The boys are giggling, one of them sprouting antlers on his head.
Voldemort: *flicks up his wand in a quick sequence* sending up an Anti-Apparition ward, a mild ward against Port-keys, a strong Floo-Blocking jinx, and finally, a wide 'Silencio' - stopping the music instantly and leaving a cool sort of ringing behind - as all three adults freeze in whatever they were doing and grab for their wands."
1,27977304,Lily,Voldemort,"Lily: *sends a red blasting curse straight to his head*
Voldemort: *deflects it, reviewing his opinion on her a little*
Potter Sr.: *yelling at the woman to leave with them*
Voldemort: *deflecting curses from Black*
Voldemort: *stops the ceiling above him from collapsing*
Voldemort: *realizes it's not just Bellatrix he can sense in Black's stance, it's Walburga*
Potter's wife: *curses loudly, running back down the stairs*
Voldemort: *watches as Potter's wife curses at him*
Voldemort: *strikes Black with a paralyzing spell*
Voldemort: *forced to give his attention to the two Potters*
Voldemort: *concedes that Potter and his wife fight quite well*
Voldemort: *sends a sharp stunner at Potter*
Lily Potter: *sends volleys of AK's and bombing curses*
Voldemort: *catches Lily's wand with a raised eyebrow*
Lily Potter: *throws a huge vase on Voldemort's head*
Voldemort: *hits Lily with a Stupefy*
Voldemort: *bounds the three securely and levitates them to the corner*
Voldemort: *wakes them up*"
2,27977304,Voldemort,Black,"Voldemort: Renervate, *whispers, thrice, in rhythmic succession*
Black: *glaring and growling* that fucking rat - and he agrees silently, Petty really is a snivelling, cowardly servant.
Voldemort: Imperio, *mutters, at a just-woken-up Lily Potter*
Potter: Wake up, LILY, NO!
Voldemort: *secures the binds on all three once more* - and Potter's holding her by the shoulder, her head falling uncomfortably, because their limbs are tied, on his chest.
Black: *muttering apologies and how this is all his fault and he's so sorry* - and *fuck Peter* - he's sorry - sorrysorrysorry,
Potter: *telling him it's not his fault*
Lily Potter: *stops sobbing and leaps on him*
Voldemort: *holds her wrists down* Does she want to die quicker? Because, he can arrange that, how was she planning to get out of this, anyway?
Potter Sr.: You fucking -
Black: Tom, be quiet,
Voldemort: *leaves the woman's wrists in shock*
Voldemort: *locks eyes with the child* Salazar, he recognizes this mind. How is that even - Christ."
3,27977304,Salazar,Harry Potter,"Salazar: He scarcely notices the boy next to Tom, that must be Harry Potter, squeezing his shoulder comfortingly and Lily Potter moving towards them, Black crawling very, very slowly to the left.
Unknown character: He shakes himself, why was he here again? The small boy in front of him is staring suspiciously at him, and knows that expression, too -
Salazar: He tries shaking himself out of this, it isn't so impossible, think about it rationally, he tells himself, Magic can certainly do this, can't it? - but the question is, did this never happen to him? Or it did, but he forgot? Or is this some version of Muggle Theories of Alternate -
Unknown character: Harry is the sweetest child ever, not like the ones he knew before, and sometimes, he just wants to give in to instinct and trust them all - but usually, that ends up leaving him hurt - so he doesn't, yet - and he meets Remus, Uncle Moony - and Peter, Uncle Wormy, he secretly doesn't like him much - but who is he to say that? - and then, Magic is real, he isn't a freak, after all, Lily and James teach him spells, James ruffling his hair and hugging him when he manages to levitate a book on his first try - he's hopeless at quidditch, and when he first tries it, Sirius and James laugh, which breaks his heart a little - but then, they laugh the same way at Remus and Lily and Peter, so he realizes they're not laughing the way the others do, he doesn't need to be good with a broom to be loved - loved - he's liked and loved by these people, he doesn't need to be special to be loved -"
4,27977304,Sirius,James,"Sirius: itch, and when he first tries it, Sirius and James laugh, which breaks his heart a little - but then, they laugh the same way at Remus and Lily and Peter, so he realizes they're not laughing the way the others do, he doesn't need to be good with a broom to be loved - loved - he's liked and loved by these people, he doesn't need to be special to be loved - )
James: *laughs with Sirius*
Remus: *laughs with Sirius and James*
Lily: *laughs with Sirius and James*
Peter: *laughs with Sirius and James*
Tom Riddle: What's your name, child? *hisses in parseltongue*
Voldemort: Incarcerous, *intones loudly*
Black: *points between Voldemort and Tom Riddle hysterically*
Voldemort: What now? What the fuck was he to do?
Black: *stops pointing*
Voldemort: Could he have had this? He hates the question as soon as it pops up, unbidden, because he has done incredibly well, considering his situation, and its weak, weak, weak to need people, he doesn't need people, he doesn't need anybody -
Voldemort: He should kill the Potter boy and go. That would be the smartest course here, the only one viable, but, but. Is he going to rid himself, or whoever the boy is - of something like this?
Voldemort: That seems... cruel. And, suddenly, Voldemort realizes, its not that he's gained a moral conscience in the past five minutes, its more the fact, that he doesn't want to upset this. This balance, this family. Tom Riddle is part of a family. It's a miracle in any universe. He needs to research it, desperately. Go to a Library.
Voldemort: He ponders for a second on whether to take himself, after all, who has better claim? But he knows himself, and he knows this boy will never forget, moreover, he would never, ever be loyal to someone who took this away from him, just after a short period of pure happiness.
Voldemort: Get a better person for a Fidelius, *says, his lip curling as he thinks of Petty, almost finding their shock amusing. You don't need to, however. Your family is safe, from my side."
5,27977304,Voldemort,Malfoy,"Voldemort: You don't need to, however. Your family is safe, from my side.

Voldemort: Ah, the Malfoy dynamics. They're extremely entertaining, he thinks, as Bella shoves food in her mouth, and talks graphically about how Roddy is in bed. Pathetic, according to her.

Voldemort: He hasn't felt satisfied like this, in quite a while."
