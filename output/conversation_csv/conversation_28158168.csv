0,28158168,Peter Parker,Thor,"Peter Parker: Hey Thor, mind if I give that hammer a try?
Thor: *looks at Peter with amusement* You think you can lift Mjolnir, young one?
Peter Parker: Well, I've been working out lately, so who knows?
Thor: *laughs* Very well, give it a shot.
Peter Parker: *grabs Mjolnir and tries to lift it* Wow, it's heavier than I thought!
Thor: *smirks* Only those who are worthy can wield it, Peter.
Peter Parker: Guess I still have some work to do then."
1,28158168,Peter,E.T.,"Peter: Why, he whined to himself, dusting the sugar off of his hands in disappointment as he watched his fallen churro disappear beneath the stampede of panicking New Yorkers. “Just...why?”
Peter: Occupied...occupied...ugh, smells like something died... he muttered as he passed them.
Peter: “Come on! It's not even prime crime hour! Why can't there be a single alley open?”
Peter: “Well,” he mumbled, mostly to test if he could hear his own voice, “that wasn't ideal.”
Peter: Hey, E.T.! he called, scrapping the idea of changing into the suit first. Plans changed when civilians were in danger.
Peter: Hey, E.T!” Peter repeated, louder. “I thought you went home!"
2,28158168,E.T,Thor,"Peter: Hey, E.T! I thought you went home!
Alien: *ignored him*
Peter: Oh, wow. That brings back memories.
Peter: Oh my gosh! Are you okay, sir? Are you hurt? Here, let me help you.
Man: I am well. Thank you, young sir.
Peter: You're Thor.
Thor: You are correct, young child! And what is your name?
Peter: Oh, um, I'm Peter Parker.
Thor: I'm delighted to meet your acquaintance, Son of Parker. But there are more serious matters to attend to. Where did I put my hammer...?"
3,28158168,Thor,Peter,"Thor: But there are more serious matters to attend to. *turned away from Peter*
Peter: *grinning stupidly at the hero*
Thor: *paused mid-squat* Where did I put my hammer...?
Peter: Oh. Oh! It's right over here, Mr. Thor! *realized* Here, I'll go ge—
Peter: Thor! *yelped as a fourth alien joined the pile*
Peter: *paused* But at the same time, he couldn't just leave Thor hanging.
Peter: *picked Thor's abandoned hammer off the ground* A cuddle pile! And you didn't invite me?
Peter: *brought the hammer down over one alien's head* Not cool, guys, not c—” *trailed off*
Peter: *gawked* Whoa. Electric hammer?
Peter: *gave closer inspection to the hammer in his hands* Wow, dude, this thing is awesome. How on earth does it generate its own electricity?
Peter: *flipped it once in the air and caught it* Like, I know you're the god of thunder, but I didn't know your hammer had magic powers too! That is so cool. I want one. Like, I won't get it, obviously, 'cause I don't want to steal your thunder—no pun intended.
Peter: *grinned at his totally-intended pun*
Peter: *chuckled awkwardly* Okay, yeah, that was a dumb joke. Sorry. Here's your hammer, Mr. Thor. *held out the weapon to its rightful owner*"
4,28158168,Peter,Thor,"Peter: Yeah, that was a dumb joke. Sorry. Here's your hammer, Mr. Thor. *held out the weapon to its rightful owner*
Thor: *stared at Peter with a bewildered expression*
Peter: *held the hammer out toward Thor for several seconds* Um, okay then. I guess I'll just...leave this here. *set the hammer on the ground in front of Thor's feet gingerly* So, um, yeah. Nice to meet you.
Peter: *received a blink as a response* Uh, hey. You good?
Older girl: *shushed Peter frantically, pointing to the end of the alley where one unconscious alien's feet were just visible*
Peter: Yeah, I know. Aliens. *left to search for a better changing spot*
Peter: *heard a loud explosion and a shrill, screeching noise* At least I didn't have to suit up.
Peter: *slipped out of the alley and back onto the main sidewalk* Once everyone deemed it safe to come out of hiding, they would all stampede through the city in a mass exodus to escape the scene, to check on their families, to return to the safe familiarity of their homes.
Peter: *turned around and began to make his way down the broken road* SON OF PARKER!
Peter: *froze*"
5,28158168,Iron Man,Thor,"Iron Man: Thor, buddy, you wanna explain why you've brought us to some high school kid? This isn't like that time with the puppy, is it? 'Cause I'm pretty sure you have teenagers where you're from.
Thor: *ignores Iron Man* *looks at Peter and smiles*
Peter: Um...thanks? I think? I'm not sure I—do you need me to hammer a giant nail, or something? What exactly is this supposed to...?
Thor: This Midgardian child is worthy! Only those who are worthy of the power of Thor may wield the hammer, and the hammer has deemed you worthy!
Peter: I'm sorry, what?
Iron Man: I don't think you get it, kid. None of us can lift the hammer. Except Viz, but he's not even human.
Thor: In fact, I do not believe I have ever witnessed a mere mortal such as yourself wield Mjolnir. But you have been deemed worthy!
Peter: Yeah, you said that. Worthy of what, exactly?
Thor: Ruling Asgard, and of bearing the power of Thor."
6,28158168,Thor,Peter Parker,"Thor: You have been deemed worthy! *gestured to the hammer dangling from Peter's index finger* But you have been deemed worthy!
Peter: Yeah, you said that. Worthy of what, exactly?
Thor: Ruling Asgard, and of bearing the power of Thor.
Peter: Sorry, sir, but I'm pretty sure you're mistaken. I'm definitely not worthy of ruling...whatever you called it. I'm just a Fr—
Peter: I'm just a freshman in high school.
Thor: Mjolnir is not capable of misjudging a warrior. You must be truly mighty indeed, to be deemed worthy by my hammer!
Peter: Mighty?
Thor: Yes, son of Parker! You fought very mightily today, indeed!
Peter: Um, thanks. You too.
Peter: I mean, I know that's like, your job—and you're, you know, the god of thunder—but still... good job, I guess.
Peter: Wow, look at the time! I gotta run. I've got, uh, things to...do. Right now. Away from here.
Bruce: A freshman in high school...?
Tony: He lifted Thor's magic hammer. Not even Mr. Good and Righteous here was worthy.
Clint: Who is this kid?
Thor: He called himself Peter Parker. He slayed multiple Chitauri warriors in mere moments. And Mjolnir has deemed him worthy of my power.
Rhodes: This high school kid is now capable of summoning lightning and flying across the sky with your magical hammer?
Thor: If Mjolnir has deemed him worthy, then I trust that young Peter will not use it in any harmful way.
Rhodes: If your magic hammer thinks he's worthy, then clearly we should just trust him. Thank goodness we don't have to worry about him abusing this newfound power.
Thor: He will be unable to abuse this power as long as the hammer is not in his possession.
Sam: He just ran off with it.
Thor: I have faith he will return it."
7,28158168,Rhodey,Sam,"Rhodey: “He will be unable to abuse this power as long as the hammer is not in his possession.”
Sam: “He just ran off with it.”
Thor: “I have faith he will return it.”
Rhodey: “He'll return it?”
Rhodey: “I don't know about Asgard, but here on Earth, teenagers are the most irresponsible, impulsive beings you'll ever see. You really think he's just going to come back here and return your—”
Teenager: “I—um. I forgot to give you your...hammer. Thing. Back.”
Tony: “Kid.”
Teenager: “Wow. Thank you, Mr. Stark. That means a lot, I—”
Tony: “Well, if you don't mind, Zeus here will be needing his hammer back.”
Teenager: “Oh, yeah! Yeah, of course.”
Thor: “Many thanks, Son of Parker. You have not only proven yourself worthy of my power; you have proven yourself worthy of my trust. I hope to fight by your side another day, young warrior.”
Teenager: “Um, that's...nice, and all, but...I'm fifteen. I don't even have my driver's license. I don't think I should be fighting by anyone's side.”
Thor: *chuckles* “Well, anyway, I've gotta scoot. I have that...thing. To go to.”
Natasha: “Right. That thing.”
Sam: “The thing that, apparently, is more important than meeting the Avengers.”
Steve: “Go on, son. Don't let us keep you back.”
Tony: “Thor, you said his name was Peter Parker?”
Natasha: “Tony, don't.”
Tony: “I didn't even say anything.”
Natasha: “You can't just invade this kid's privacy like that. He deserves a normal life.”
Tony: “I didn't say—”
Natasha: “Promise me you won't dive into this kid's personal files on the internet.”
Tony: “Fine!”"
8,28158168,Tony,Steve,"Tony: He deserves a normal life.
Steve: I didn't say—
Tony: Tony.
Steve: What?
Natasha: Promise me you won't dive into this kid's personal files on the internet.
Tony: Geez, Romanoff. You make me out to be some kind of stalker.
Tony: Fine! I won't look into this potential asset. I will ignore the fact that a random teenager on the street was able to wield Thor's hammer. I will look the other way entirely just so he can continue the boring, mundane life of a teenager. Is that what you want?
Rhodey: Yes.
Tony: Alright, fine. We'll leave the kid alone.
Tony: ...But if we ever ran into the kid again, y'know, in passing—"
