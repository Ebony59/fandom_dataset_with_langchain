0,28230387,Draco,Harry,"Draco: I wasn’t playing, Potter.
Harry: *ambles along at a much slower rate*
Draco: *hides near the grove of hazel trees and waits for Harry to walk beneath them*
Harry: *acts outraged by the treacherous ambush*
Draco: *smiles the exact same way he did the very first time he did it*
Harry: *lounges about invitingly by the warmth of the fire*
Draco: *gives little glances*
Draco: What? The baby is what?
Hermione: It’s a boy. Come to dinner on Sunday, you can suggest some names.
Harry: Albus.
Hermione: No.
Draco: Merlin was the greatest wizard.
Ginny: What about Augustus McVicar, the father of modern potions?
Hermione: I am not naming a lovely, adorable baby ‘Albus’. I’m not.
Harry: What about...Severus?
Draco: Even Severus hated his own name."
1,28230387,Draco,Severus,"Draco: “You’re banned from naming things,”
Draco: “Even Severus hated his own name.” Draco takes a sip of wine. “Who calls their beloved child Severus?”
Astoria: “I had a favourite uncle called Balbinus Aubrey Greengrass,” Astoria says. “Should I inflict his legacy upon an innocent child? No.”
Harry: “Aubrey’s not actually that bad, really, it’s — ”
Ginny: “Sometimes,” she says fondly, “you have terrible taste. Just awful.”
Harry: “Fine,” Harry says, sitting back and folding his arms across his chest. “I won’t name anything, then!”
Draco: “Oh, thank Merlin.”
Ginny: “Yes, excellent choice.”
Draco: “Well, that’s a weight off my chest,” Draco says. “I was thinking about getting a Niffler, but...”
Ginny: “Imagine what Harry would call it,” Ginny says. “Merlin Albus McWizard.”
Matthew: “What’s a Niffler? Sounds interesting. Astoria, you have to tell me.”
Hermione: “Ugh, no. Ask Hermione, she likes explaining things.”
Hermione: “It’s Ginny’s turn,” Hermione retorts.
Ron: “We’ve got some names in mind, anyway,” he says.
Hermione: “Yes. Ron suggested Bronwyn for a girl, and Eric for a boy. I quite like both of those names.”
Harry: “Bronwyn and Eric? After the last two captains of the Chudley Cannons?”
Draco: “I’ll clear the table,” he says, picking up the nearest plate and hurrying to the kitchen.
Matthew: “Excellent idea. Come on, Sophie, help clear the table,” Matthew adds, standing up; Ginny and Astoria are practically on his heels.
Harry: “Well...guess they might need some help...” and joins the others in the kitchen, shutting the door behind him.
Astoria: “Honestly, Harry! Does your brain cell ever get lonely in there?”
Matthew: “Sorry,” Matthew says, not looking the least bit apologetic. “It was a good joke.”
Ginny: “You could try to show a little tact,” Ginny says, frowning at Harry. “You know they’ve been arguing about names forever, it took them so long to finally agree on a couple of names. Even Draco kept his mouth shut.”
Harry: “Because he doesn’t know about the Chudley Cannons,” Harry protests. “That’s the only reason he didn’t say anything — ”
Draco: “Excuse me,” Draco says. “It’s Ron’s favourite team, of course I know about it. Frankly, you’ve hurt my feelings.”
Harry: “You are not — ”
Ginny: “Don’t be awful. It’s not Draco’s fault you’re insensitive.”
Draco: “What’s a Niffler?” Matthew demands, hoisting Sophie onto the kitchen counter. She eyes the leftover pudding with a calculating expression.
Harry: “You’re doing it again.”
Draco: “Doing what?”
Harry: “Making all my friends like you more than me.”
Draco: “That’s ridiculous. They’re all my friends. Astoria, tell him.”"
2,28230387,Matthew,Sophie,"Matthew: What’s a Niffler?” *hoisting Sophie onto the kitchen counter.* She eyes the leftover pudding with a calculating expression.
Harry: *glaring at Draco* “You’re doing it again.”
Draco: *shrugs* “Doing what?”
Harry: “Making all my friends like you more than me.”
Draco: “That’s ridiculous. They’re all my friends. Astoria, tell him.”
Astoria: *dumps an armful of cutlery into the sink* “Harry, don’t be ridiculous. We’re all Draco’s friends.”
Harry: *gestures frantically* “See? Like that!”
Draco: “I can’t help it if I’m perfectly charming and you’re...” *gestures broadly at Harry.*
Ginny: “Not.” *finishes helpfully.*
Harry: *to Sophie* “At least you like me. I’m your favourite uncle, right?”
Sophie: *looks at him, then at the pudding* “Of course you are. Can I have a second serving?”
Harry: “Absolutely.” *fetching a serving spoon.*
Draco: “I don’t have to buy people’s affections.”
Matthew: “If nobody tells me what a Niffler is, I’ll pour custard into the fireplace and ruin your stupid Floo thing.”
Hermione: *storms in* “Harry! I hope you didn’t have plans for Saturday!”
Harry: “Oh, actually, I was thinking of — ”
Hermione: “Cancel it. You are going shopping, you will buy every baby name book you can find, you will bring them to the Burrow and help me and Molly write down names.”
Harry: “But you said I was terrible at — ”
Hermione: “You are. You will not speak. You will not make any suggestions. You will sit in silence and think about what you’ve done.”
Harry: *looks around the room* “Draco.”
Draco: “What?”
Harry: “Hermione’s being mean to me.”
Draco: “Good.”"
3,28230387,Ginny,Ron,"Ginny: Can't believe Christmas is nearly here.
Ron: Went quick.
Ron: See you all on Christmas Day, then?
Ron: Fair warning, Mum's gone overboard this year and made matching scarves and hats for everyone.
Matthew: And socks? The ones I got last year were so comfortable.
Ron: Yeah, I expect so. The — ugh! What the — what is this? Who poured custard in the fireplace?
Draco: *starts laughing*
Ron: You prat! Knew it was you or Harry. All smug with your stupid Muggle car while the rest of us have to take the Floo –
Astoria: It was Matthew, Astoria says angrily. I recognise exactly the sort of childish, petty —
Matthew: I told you, Matthew says with not a trace of repentance. I told you. I said, if nobody tells me about the Niffler –
Ron: Oh, for Merlin's sake. Ron waves his wand at the fireplace. Scourgify! You'll get your chance on Christmas Day, anyway, you and Dad will ramble about Muggle and magical stuff like usual. You're not getting socks now, though!
Hermione: *kissing Astoria's cheek and thanking her for dinner before stepping into the green flames*
Ginny: *giving a cheerful wave as she goes*
Matthew: Here's the bit where your filthy rich ex-husband thanks us for the dinner we just made for him, Matthew says, a mischievous glint in his eye. Are you sure I shouldn't be jealous?
Astoria: At this point, I feel I've more reason to be jealous. You and Harry are terribly good friends. Terribly.
Matthew: What can I say? He's a good-looking bloke, Matthew says slyly.
Harry: *grins*
Harry: Nothing wrong with spending time with a very good friend.
Draco: Think you're funny, don't you?
Astoria: Think you're funny, don't you?
Matthew: *laughs*
Harry: *laughs*
Matthew: Look at them! So disapproving. Identical expressions, Matthew says. Like two angry peas in a pod.
Harry: They should get married or something, Harry adds, much to Matthew's amusement.
Draco: Think you're funny, don't you?
Astoria: Think you're funny, don't you?
Draco: Come on, then, Draco says to Harry, looking irritated. But as they turn and walk to the door, his expression softens. My Harry, he repeats.
Astoria: Go home and be sentimental there.
Harry: *thanks them for the meal, and promises to see them at the Burrow on Christmas Day, and says Sophie might have perhaps too many presents this year, and Astoria admonishes him for spoiling her. Draco was the one who bought all the presents, but Harry — in penance for his earlier jokes with Matthew — takes the blame.*
Harry: *lingers by the front door, full of farewells, and then steps into the cold night, drawing their cloaks around themselves — and then they're gone.*
Harry: Needs another service, he tells Draco.
Draco: Again? Should just replace the old thing,"
4,28230387,Harry,Draco,"Harry: Needs another service, *frowns as he steers around a corner*.
Draco: Again? Should just replace the old thing.
Harry: I mean, imagine if she’d found out afterwards. Ink freshly drying on the birth certificate, and then someone casually lets slip that she’s named her kid in honour of Chudley Cannon’s third-worst captain.
Draco: Fourth-worst. You’re forgetting Mulgrave.
Harry: *starts laughing* Merlin, you really do listen to all Ron’s rants! If I didn’t know better —
Draco: Oh, shut up.
Harry: That’s so sweet.
Draco: I’m going to file for divorce.
Harry: I’ll hold you to that. Oh, speaking of Italy, Neville’s returned. Got some new specimens he wants to show you.
Harry: Especially when he’s covering it with Draco.
Draco: *touches Harry, drawing him from his reverie* Thought you were asleep.
Harry: I was thinking about Snowdonia.
Draco: It’s better with you.
Harry: *drives on, one hand resting on the steering wheel, the other still held by Draco*"
5,28230387,Draco,Harry,"Draco: “It’s quiet. Bigger, somehow. Emptier. The mountains seem to eat the stars.” He closes his eyes again, leaning his head against the cool glass of the window. “It’s better with you.”
Harry: *drives on, one hand resting on the steering wheel, the other still held by Draco* Everything, he thinks. Everything.
Draco: *stirs his coffee briskly, his back set to Harry, and says nothing.*
Harry: “We could sneak in there,” Harry says. “The key’s under the mat.”
Draco: “Get that look off your face.”
Harry: *laughs*
Draco: *steps up behind Harry and rests his chin on his shoulder* “Hello.”
Harry: “Hello.” *closes his eyes against the white sky, feeling the warmth of Draco against him*
Draco: “Did you find what you were looking for?”
Harry: “Yes.”
Draco: “That’s good.”"
6,28230387,Draco,Harry,"Draco: That’s good.”“Yes, we can get out of this wretched weather, *doesn't move for a long time*
Harry: *content to stay there too*
Draco: Well, it’s north, wherever it is, *drives*
Harry: You are not —
Draco: What’s wrong with —
Harry:  — absolutely not wasting our annual Christmas Eve trip on Birmingham.
Draco: You’re being very judgmental. You know, Birmingham has its charms. For example, Moseley Bog is quite nice this time of —
Harry: You are not —
Draco: The Hippodrome, can’t forget that. I’m actually quite excited about it.
Harry: *narrows his eyes*
Draco: Happy?
Harry: Yes.
Draco: *smiles at him*
Harry: *settles back in his seat*
Draco: Here?
Harry: Where are we?
Draco: We’re not there yet. *holds out his hand* I’m afraid the trip is too long, even for us. Magic will take us the rest of the way.
Harry: *looks down at Draco’s hand*"
7,28230387,Harry,Draco,"Harry: Where are we?
Draco: We're not there yet. *holds out his hand* I'm afraid the trip is too long, even for us. Magic will take us the rest of the way.
Harry: *looks down at Draco's hand* *reaches out*
Harry: *arrives in a dizzying rush of magic* I got McGonagall's permission. No need to worry about the wards.
Harry: *looks ahead* Hogwarts rises up from the Scottish wilderness like a craggy mountain of stone and turrets. It glitters in the darkness with a hundred tiny lights.
Draco: *breath hangs silver in the dark air* Detention in first year —
Harry: Oh, Merlin. My first proper adventure.
Draco: *laughs* You ran. You ran and took the only lantern with you, you prat. Yes, I'm still mad about it.
Draco: *laughs* Look, the old pitch.
Harry: *looks at the goalposts* They always look so small, he thinks, when he's in the air flying. But here, standing at the foot of one of the posts, it looks enormous.
Harry: *looks up into the sky suddenly* Just remembering.
Draco: *looks at Harry* When we were eleven.
Harry: *looks up again* I like to imagine the memories are all here. If you look hard enough. All the ghosts.
Draco: *says after a moment* This is where you found the timeturner.
Harry: *starts and looks around* Yes. Somewhere around here.
Draco: *smiling* You know it by heart. Don't try pretending otherwise, Potter.
Harry: *pulls a face at him* *draws his wand* There. Near the goalpost."
8,28230387,Draco,Harry,"Draco: “Erm, let’s see...I’m not quite sure...” *smiling at him* “You know it by heart. Don’t try pretending otherwise, Potter.”
Harry: *pulls a face at him, draws his wand, and mutters a navigation spell* “There. Near the goalpost.”
Draco: “Well, off you go.”
Harry: *gives Draco another suspicious look, although a certain nervous feeling is beginning to stir in his stomach* *goes to the area marked by the spell, glances at Draco, and then waits uncertainly*
Draco: “See if you can find another timeturner, then,” *still smiling, his hands jammed in his pockets to keep them warm*
Harry: *pauses* “Defodio,” *says cautiously, watching the snow gouge itself from the earth, soon followed by the soil itself* *misses the tiny wooden box, but he hears the distinct thud, and he picks it up, brushing dirt from it* *The box is plain, without markings, and held shut by a simple latch* *After another glance at Draco, he flicks the latch and opens the box*
Harry: “Oh,” *he says, and he tries to pick up the ring but drops it; his hands are trembling a little* *Draco will no doubt be amused, he thinks, but Draco doesn’t laugh* *He comes over to Harry and leans down to pick up the ring, brushing the snow from it, and hands it to Harry* *“Another memory for this place,” he says. “Two more ghosts. Of me and you.”*
Harry: *closes his hand around the ring, feeling the icy metal against his palm, and then reaches out to touch Draco’s chin, drawing him forward into a kiss*
Harry: *They stay there for a long time, the snow falling and the stars rising* *Everything, Harry thinks* *Everything.*"
