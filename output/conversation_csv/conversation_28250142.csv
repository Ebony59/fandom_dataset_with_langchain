0,28250142,Harry,Draco,"Harry: Draco, if there are any problems, we can figure it out together.
Draco: No, we can’t. I don’t want to deal with the publicity and the hatred and my father. You’re not worth all that.
Draco: Sorry. Sorry. I just meant… Just- oh, shut up and kiss me, Potter!
Harry: And who’s Harry to refuse?
Harry: He probably just forgot, is all, and Harry will be able to make brief eye contact with Draco before he plummets into the lake for an hour and he’ll just have to pretend that’s good enough.
Harry: Draco doesn’t want people to know. Harry obliges.
Unknown character: Harry!
Harry: Harry!"
1,28250142,Harry,Neville,"Harry: You're sure about this, Neville?
Neville: Absolutely.
Harry: Most likely?
Ron: I told you that wouldn't be reassuring, Neville! You should have just lied!
Harry: You're telling me this now? You must be joking.
Neville: I just wanted to help.
Ron: I still think it'll be fine and you shouldn't have said anything. But, you know, if Harry dies, no one will blame you.
Harry: This still makes you loads more help than Ron and Hermione.
Ron: Hey! I was at least trying to find her- the woman has disappeared! Probably off with Krum. What were you doing this whole time?
Harry: Did you? Find her, I mean?
Ron: Well, no, but-
Harry: Then you were entirely useless to me and Hermione.
Neville: You seem a little tense, Harry.
Harry: Do I?"
2,28250142,Harry,Ron,"Harry: Do I?
Ron: Harry, come on.
Harry: Sorry. *helps Ron out of the boat*
Harry: Had Draco not even come to watch him?
Albus Dumbledore: In order to win, each champion need only find their treasure and return to the surface. Simple enough. Except for this, they will have one hour to do so and one hour only. After that, they'll be on their own."
3,28250142,Mad-Eye Moody,Dumbledore,"Mad-Eye Moody: Put that in your mouth. *just behind Harry* You may begin at the start of the cannon.
Dumbledore: You may begin at the start of the cannon.
Harry: *rushes forward in the water* How long has he been underwater? Is Draco alright? *puts his hands on either side of Draco's face* Harry grips his shoulders to shake him, desperate for a response, but there isn’t even so much as a twitch. *moves his fingers down to feel Draco's pulse* Harry had left the ball early, slipping out and hoping nobody noticed. *met up with Draco in an abandoned corridor* Because they wanted to dance and nobody could see them together. *looks up* And Harry has to swim up there with Draco or let him drown.
Harry: Will Draco be angry? *looks around, waiting for the other victors* When none comes, he rushes to the lake floor to find a jagged rock, beginning to cut Draco free of the rope tying him down. *attempts to move onto Hermione* The mermaids encircling him raise their spears with hisses, forcing him to back off despite his protests."
4,28250142,Harry,Hermione,"Harry: It takes a while, but he manages- when he attempts to move onto Hermione, the mermaids encircling him raise their spears with hisses, forcing him to back off despite his protests. He doesn’t know what to do- Victor isn’t anywhere in sight for Hermione, the clock is nearing an hour, and there’s no way Harry is going to leave her at the bottom of the lake.
Cedric: Eventually, he must decide he doesn’t care. He shifts his attention to Cho, cuts her free with a knife he produced from his pocket- Harry should have thought to bring a knife- and swims to the surface, securing first place.
Harry: Second place would be alright, but there’s no way Harry is going to leave Hermione. He attempts to cut her free again, but is met with more hissing and threats from the mermaids that force him back. It’s just then that a poorly transfigured Krum comes rushing forward with a face that’s a cross between himself and a shark and almost bites Hermione’s legs off in an attempt to tear the rope. Imagining that Hermione prefers herself with legs, he offers his sharp rock to Krum who cuts her free with one tug and carries her to a surface without a second glance.
Harry: Harry looks behind him again- time is running out. Where is Fleur? If he doesn’t get Draco up, will the mermaids keep him there forever, until his skin becomes so pruned and bloated that he’s unrecognizable? Harry shakes him. Maybe if he wakes up, he can get himself to the surface and Harry can focus on the little girl.
Harry: He holds on to Draco and rushes forwards, cutting the girl free as quick as he can, doing his best to avoid the screaming and scratching of the intervening mermaids, hissing that she’s not his treasure and that he’s breaking the rules. He doesn’t care. There’s no way he could leave this little girl to die any more than he could leave Draco. Pulling his wand and threatening to hex the lot of them seems to do the trick.
Harry: Water rushes upwards around him. Or, rather, he rushes downwards in the water as what feels like the tentacles of a hundred Grindylows wrap around his ankles with their slimy but firm grip. It’s all he can do to shove Draco and the girl up to the surface, hoping enough luck and kicking his legs will be enough to allow him to follow. He jerks his knees upwards, attempting to get them to relinquish their grip, but it just pulls the angry water demons along with him. He continues kicking, clawing upwards, desperate for air- his wand, he needs his to use his wand. With the last shred of air he has left shouts “Relashio!” and points it directly at the sickly green monsters. The effect is immediate. They lose their grip on his ankle, springing backward and giving Harry enough time to force himself up to the surface.
Harry: Harry breaks through, his priority being to draw large, deep gulps of oxygen into his burning lungs."
5,28250142,Harry,Draco,"Harry: It’s more than enough. It’s not enough at all.
Draco: *looking at Harry, now*

Draco: I’m wet, Potter.
Hermione: Listen, we don’t know why it was you-
Draco: I’m perfectly aware of why, Granger, thank you very much.
Hermione: Well, why?"
6,28250142,Draco,Harry,"Draco: I want to talk to you, *His tone of finality makes Harry think of a Christmas present, cleanly wrapped and ready to go- no further discussion. Don’t open until Christmas.*
Hermione: Well, why? *She looks between the two of them.*
Draco: Because he’s obsessed with me, that’s why. *He manages to jump backward just in time for Harry to miss what would have been a well-aimed kick to his shins.*
Harry: Oh, sod off!
Pansy: *hits Draco’s arm*
Harry: *calls* Hey!
Ron: *snaps* Only I’m allowed to make fun of Ginny’s horrid singing valentine.
Draco: *barks out laughing*"
