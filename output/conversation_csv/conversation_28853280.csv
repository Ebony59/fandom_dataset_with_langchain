0,28853280,Narcissa Malfoy,Hailey,"Narcissa Malfoy: You have potential. Cousin James has given me much to work with. I’ll make a lady of you yet.
Hailey: What do you mean by that?
Lucius Malfoy: The peacocks have arrived, darling. She’ll blend right in when necessary.
Hailey: I don’t know what you’re planning, but I’ll have no part in it.
Narcissa: And the resemblance is acceptable?
Lucius: Uncanny, darling. No one will be able to tell she’s not really one of them.
Hailey: Sirius, what plan would this be?
Sirius: The Make Sure Hailey Lives and Is Safe From Voldemort While We Find and Destroy His Horcruxes Plan!
Hailey: How are you going to accomplish that?"
1,28853280,Hailey,Lucius,"Hailey: How are you going to accomplish that?
Lucius: I've purchased several albino peacocks. Whenever the wards alert us that company is arriving, you will transform and hide amongst them. It's best to keep something hidden in plain sight.
Narcissa: And when I'm not a peahen?
Lucius: Then you will reside with us in the manor, behind extensive wards.
Narcissa: It will be my honor to teach you all that a proper pureblood lady needs to know. That way you will be prepared for your eventual marriage following the war.
Hailey: Why would I need to know how a proper pureblood lady acts? I've been told quite vehemently that I'm a 'filthy half-blood' more than once—and by your son, no less.
Sirius: What have you been teaching the boy?
Lucius: Better than that. I'll certainly have a word with him when he returns for the summer holiday.
Narcissa: I must apologize for Draco's ill-mannered tongue. We will have words with him.
Sirius: Hailey, pup—hmm, can I still call you that if you're a peahen? I wonder what a baby peahen is—
Lucius: Do focus, Sirius. If you're capable of it, that is.
Sirius: I'm your godfather and Alice Longbottom is your godmother. We're both purebloods. Magical godparents are tied by blood and magic to their godchildren. So, basically, our bloodlines plus James's erase any 'taint' that Lily's Muggle blood would have caused.
Hailey: Sleep. Just let me sleep.
Unknown character: Shh, calm down, beauty.
Unknown character: It's just me, my beautiful one. All is well."
