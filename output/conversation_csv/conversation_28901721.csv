Draco: Excuse me.
Rose: I Rose. Who are you?"
1,28901721,Draco,Rose,"Draco: Didn't your mother ever tell you not to talk to strangers? *leaving his door open as he made his way back to his desk*
Rose: Well I am a stranger and you should leave.
Draco: You're not a stranger. *grabbing a spare bit of parchment and dipped his quill in ink before responding*
Rose: Your name is weird. *attempting to mimic his name*
Draco: My name is not weird you little- *cutting himself off*
Rose: Where is your mother?
Draco: You need to sit down.
Rose: Can I draw?
Draco: No you may not draw, you can sit down and wait for your mother.

Draco: Draco. And I do not care.
Rose: You can hang it up in your office.

2,28901721,Hermione,Rose,"Hermione: Rose! Hi, Mummy!
Rose: You cryin' mummy?
Hermione: Rose, what have I told you about wandering off? You scared me very much.
Rose: Sorry mummy. I stayed with Dayco, he's my friend.
Hermione: Thank you for watching her Malfoy. I'm sorry if she caused you any trouble, Harry and I needed to discuss what to do with Ron's things.
Draco: Just make sure she doesn't wander back here.
Rose: Bye Dayco, see you soon!
Rose: He has a funny name mummy.
Draco: *groan*
Rose: *drawing a picture* Rosie *pointing to the shorter stick figure* Silly named man *pointing to the taller stick figure*

Rose: Dayco!
Draco: What do you want?
Rose: A dagon. D-rag-on. It's a dragon.
Draco: It's a very nice dragon.
Rose: It's for you. Mummy says your name is D-ra-co and she tolded me it means dr-dragon!
Rose: Mummy says I have trouble saying the letter R, so I missay them when I talk."
3,28901721,Rose,Draco,"Rose: Mummy says your name is D-ra-co and she tolded me it means dr-dragon!
Draco: Uh-huh.
Draco: Rose where is your mother?
Rose: Sometimes it’s hard for me to say squirrel. So mummy makes me say it again and again or sound it out.
Rose: I don’t like squirrels they are very very scary, one time when I was at the park a squirrel chaseded me-
Draco: Rose, where is your mother?
Rose: In a meeting. I told her I was coming to see you.
Rose: What are you gonna name your dagon?
Draco: Dragon. And I am not naming it.
Rose: You gotta name him. If he doesn’t get a name his feelings will be hurt.
Draco: That dragon is not real therefore it cannot have feelings.
Rose: Yeah-huh. You has to name him, it’s the rules.
Draco: It isn’t a rule.
Rose: Is to.
Draco: Oh for fuc-
Rose: Bad word!
Draco: Shouldn’t you go back to your mother?
Rose: Nope.
Draco: If I name this toy will you stop talking?
Rose: *nods*
Draco: Dragon.
Rose: You can’t name him Dragon! That’s not even a good name.
Draco: I thought you said you’d stop talking?
Draco: *sends a missive to Hermione to get her daughter*
Draco: Thank you for keeping an eye on her.
Hermione: *tucks her hair behind her ear* Honey, if Draco wants to name..."
4,28901721,Hermione,Draco,"Hermione: Honey, if Draco wants to name his dragon, Dragon, he is allowed to do that. *pulls Rose into her arms, running a hand over the little girl’s hair* You wouldn’t like it if Draco told you couldn’t name your dragon something would you?
Draco: No she...she’s well behaved. *looks at Hermione, then at Rose spinning in the hall*
Hermione: I think, *her eyes flitting to the stuffed dragon briefly* That Rose is a good judge of character, as good as a four-year-old can be.
Draco: She could come back, *gestures to Rose* If she’s ever in the office again she could come back if you need her to.
Hermione: *smiles at him* You’re not as bad as you make yourself out to be.
Draco: *nods* Her dragon’s name is Draco.
Hermione: *laughs* Oh, I completely forgot this place is a muggle establishment, and I forgot my wallet in my office. *sighs, pulling her arm from his*"
5,28901721,Hermione,Draco,"Hermione: Oh, I completely forgot this place is a muggle establishment, and I forgot my wallet in my office.
Draco: *forced himself not to frown at the loss* I can head back in if you’d just wait a moment.
Draco: *reached into his pocket and pulled out the plastic card* Will this work there?
Hermione: *blinked at him and then looked at the card* Y-yes, I didn’t think you’d have a credit card.
Draco: I’d reckon you wouldn’t, though I will say it is awfully convenient.
Hermione: *leans into him* Do you want to just get what I do? I think you’ll like it.
Draco: *tries to ignore the way her body pressed into his* Sure.
Hermione: *orders something with hazelnut*
Draco: *swipes his card when instructed to do so*
Hermione: You could meet me there for coffee again tomorrow before work if you wanted?
Draco: *nods his head*
Hermione: *smiles*

Draco: *door swung open forcefully* What’s wrong Rose?
Rose: I’m never going back to school, I hate it.
Draco: *pulls the little girl from his shoulder and looks down at her* Tell my mummy not to send me back.
Draco: *wipes the girl’s tears* Why don’t you tell me what happened?
Rose: *sniffles and wipes her hand on her nose* There’s a girl in my class, and s-she told me that my daddy hates me and that’s why he left me and mummy.
Draco: *freezes* Does my dad hate me, Draco?"
6,28901721,Draco,Rose,"Draco: Does my dad hate me, Draco?
Draco: Rose, I don’t know your father very well. But, I think I know you pretty well, don’t you think?
Rose: We are best friends.
Draco: As your best friend, I think you are a very special girl. And I think that anyone would be lucky to be a part of your life.
Rose: So how come my dad left?
Draco: Sometimes the people who are supposed to love us the most, have a little bit of trouble. And even though it might hurt us to not have them around, we have to remember that it is not our fault that the ones we love are struggling. And, Rose, you have lots and lots of people who love you so much.
Rose: Mummy loves me, and gramma and grandpa, and uncle Harry.
Draco: They all love you loads and loads, Rose.
Rose: And you love me, right?
Draco: I love you too, kid.
Rose: Draco, guess what?"
7,28901721,Rose,Draco,"Rose: Draco, guess what?
Draco: Your mother finally agreed to let me use a silencing spell on you?
Rose: My birthday party is next weekend!
Draco: You're coming right?
Rose: Uh-
Draco: Yes, I'll be there.

Hermione: You came!
Draco: Told you I would.
Draco: Happy birthday.
Hermione: There you are. I was worried the floo connection wasn't working properly.
Draco: Just a bit uncomfortable if I'm honest.
Hermione: Don't worry, they've all been made aware you'd be here. Rose is very excited you're here.
Draco: Just don't throw me to the lions, Granger.
Hermione: Don't you worry, you'll be by my side all day.

Draco: Rose told me you had a picture of me on your wall once.
Hermione: I put it up to replace the wedding picture that had been there before.
Draco: Do you miss it? Being married to Ron?
Hermione: I think that a part of me will always be thankful for my time spent with Ron, he was my first love and he gave me Rose."
8,28901721,Hermione,Ron,"Hermione: Being married to Ron?
Hermione: I think that a part of me will always be thankful for my time spent with Ron, he was my first love and he gave me Rose.
Hermione: But I think that some of the best things that can happen to us, are the ones we least expect.
Hermione: *pushed herself onto her toes, pressing her lips to his.*
Hermione: *And as his fingers tangled into her hair, returning her kiss with equal fervor, he couldn’t agree more.*"
