0,29409711,Sirius,Hufflepuff,"Sirius: Never have I ever... snogged a Hufflepuff.
Remus: Very funny, Evans.
Sirius: *takes a shot*
Marlene: Never have I ever snogged a member of The Noble and Most Ancient House of Black.
Remus: I hate you, McKinnon. *throws back his shot*
James: He was my first kiss... and my second, and third.
Sirius: Fuck yeah I was!"
1,29409711,Remus,James,"Remus: Your turn, Remus, Lily proclaimed, tipsily leaning her head onto Mary’s shoulder. Remus smirked, and his eyes flickered to James. The messy-haired marauder, despite fitting all dumb jock stereotypes, was not stupid, and his face fell into a cold look of realisation immediately.
James: “Don’t you dare, Moony-” he warned, but Remus waved him off and cleared his throat.
Remus: “Never have I ever,” Remus started, leaving a long pause for anticipation to build up, “snogged TWO members of The Noble and Most Ancient House of Black.”
James: James, after a painful moment of silence, threw his shot back with confidence, wincing and slamming the glass down with a thud. Remus was looking at him with a wide grin, and James shook his head, his own smile growing.
Remus: You are going straight to hell, Moony.
Sirius: “AH-” he yelped, pointing at James, mouth open. The air hung heavy in the room. Lily’s jaw was practically on the floor, Mary’s not far behind it, and Marlene hid the lower half of her face behind her hand, shaking in silent laughter. “YOU- YOU-”
James: James’ lips formed a tight line, finally looking up to meet Sirius’ eyes. Remus didn’t think Sirius had ever looked more horrified in his life, and it took every cell in his body not to burst into laughter (again, like Marlene, who by this point had silent tears streaming down her face).
Mary: “Wait,” Mary started, shaking her head, “Wait, wait, wait- I mean, I…” she stared at James with a look of disbelief. “Which one?”
James: “Come on, Mare,” James groaned. “I’m not exactly going to be banging Bella the crazy bitch, am I?”
Sirius: “BANGING?” Sirius practically screamed, and James turned as white as snow.
James: “No- no, oh my god Padfoot-”
Sirius: Sirius scrambled to his feet, knocking over the bottle of firewhiskey by his side, eyes wide and gaze hard. He took one look at James, at Remus, then back at James, and..."
2,29409711,Sirius,Bella,"Sirius: “I’m not exactly going to be banging Bella the crazy bitch, am I?”
James: “BANGING?” Sirius practically screamed, and James turned as white as snow.
Sirius: “No- no, oh my god Padfoot-”
Sirius: “REGULUS! REGULUS!”
Remus: “He’s hardly going to be up there, is he?” Remus shouted, but Sirius had already disappeared up the stairwell.

Lily: *took this opportunity to hit James full force on the arm, dropping her hands from where they had been covering her mouth in shock.* “Regulus? Regulus?” she gasped, and James groaned again.
James: “Yes, that is his name, well done-”
Marlene: “When?” gasped Marlene, and James sighed.
James: “Fourth year.”
Remus: *cleared his throat, and James scowled at him.* “…And fifth year.”
Remus: *cleared his throat again, and if he hadn’t been so drunk, he would almost be scared James was going to kill him in his sleep.* “…And a little bit earlier this year, too.”
James: *finished, running a hand over his face and avoiding eye contact with anyone.* Mary and Lily were both laughing in disbelief; Lily pinched the bridge of her nose and muttered “Holy motherfucking shit, Potter” under her breath.

James: *looked up, frantic, and pointed at Remus.* “If he kills me, I’m gonna fucking kill you.”
Remus: *bit his lip, grinning, as Sirius entered the room, gaze fiery and Marauders Map clutched in his hands.* He stalked up to James and Remus held his breath.
James: “Okay, I’m coming, FUCK, Sirius-” *as they walked further away from the group and out into the corridors.*

Lily: *slapping her hands onto her knees and announcing “Well, I’m not missing this.”*

Sirius: *hesitated, looking between them both, as if he hadn’t planned this far and was unsure of where to start.*
Regulus: “How’d he find out, then?” he asked, directed at James, who smiled sheepishly and answered “Drinking game,” with a shrug. Regulus nodded.
Sirius: *gaped, looking between the pair frantically, before he found his voice.* “YOU? AND- AND YOU-” he said, gesturing wildly between the two of them. James winced, but Regulus simply rolled his eyes.
Regulus: “Sirius, dear brother, do shut up or you’ll wake up Peeves.” Sirius’ eyes widened comically.
Sirius: *It was a long, painful moment before he said anything again.* “How long?” he asked, still angry but significantly quieter. Regulus inhaled sharply and Sirius raised his eyebrows in a warning.
Regulus: “You’re not going to like it-”
Sirius: “How. Long?”
Regulus: “…Three years?
Sirius: *Sirius’ eyebrows raised with so much vigour it seemed they were about to slide up off his head and fly away.* “THREE YEARS"
3,29409711,Regulus,Sirius,"Regulus: Sirius!
Sirius: Padfoot, please don't make it weird...
Regulus: DON'T MAKE IT--
Sirius: He- 'Don't make it weird' he says, oh my GOD you have been deflowering my brother for three years and it's supposed to not be weird?
James: We didn't- If it means anything, Pads, we didn't...
Regulus: Flowers are all very much intact, big brother.
Sirius: It was just- look, it just- it was an accident.
James: Yes, please do better, Potter, I don't want to have to be questioned for murder.
Regulus: No, that's not what I mean, he- okay we got to talking, right, and he was so upset over something that had happened at home and I- I was upset, too, I don't even remember what over and we k- we kissed.
James: And it just became... a regular thing.
Sirius: How regular?
Regulus: Uh- maybe once... once a week?
James: It wasn't planned, we didn't have a fucking snog schedule, Pads.
Regulus: Oh, for heaven's sake."
4,29409711,Sirius,Regulus,"Sirius: So, you... You're...
Regulus: Yes, getting off, whatever you want to fucking call it-
Sirius: ...happy?
Regulus: Yes, I am. We- we are.
James: I don't like it.
Regulus: I knew you wouldn't.
Sirius: And I don't like that I found out through a fucking drinking game, from my boyfriend-
James: You told... Remus.
Regulus: Not willingly, he walked in on us.
Remus: And if it makes you feel any better, it was absolutely traumatising.
Sirius: We will be having words later.
James: Well, if you want something that will make you feel better, we broke it off at the beginning of this year because of you. Well- mainly, because of you, but also because the lives we lead are so incompatible and... With the way things are going, I don't want to risk losing anything more than I have to.
Sirius: What's that supposed to mean?
James: It means I realized that if I lost him I would lose my mind, and distancing myself while I thought I still could seemed like the best option at the time.
Regulus: Thought you still could?
James: Don't be stupid, Reg. I think we both know that I can't do that. I don't know who I was kidding.
Sirius: You're not just... getting off, are you? This is..."
5,29409711,Regulus,James,"Regulus: You’re not just… getting off, are you? This is… more.
James: I love him.
Regulus: You don’t have to say it back, Reg. But I love you.
Lily: Oh, god, It’s just so sweet!
Regulus: Sirius, I’m sixteen. And I’m my own person. I know what I want. This is what I want.
Sirius: Merlin, Reg, all of the people in this fucking school and you pick this insufferable prat.
James: So… We’re good?
Sirius: Yeah, we’re good, you absolute wanker. But you try anything funny and I’ll skin you alive, Potter. Half of me came from Walburga Black, don’t you fucking forget it.
Regulus: Mmmm… no you won’t.
Sirius: He hurts you, I’ll kill him.
Regulus: Wanna come back up with us?"
