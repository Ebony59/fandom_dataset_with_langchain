Harriet Potter: *cheekily* See? I'm a danger to society.
Viktor: No more danger than Quidditch.

2,29536533,Viktor,Harriet,"Viktor: you said you couldn't dance. *She sighed.* Wish I did. I'll probably step on your toes all evening.
Harriet: *To prove her point, she accidentally stepped on his foot.* I'm so sorry!
Viktor: *Waving it aside.* Then no feet on ground. *Picks her up and spins her around in tune with the music, causing her to giggle.*

Many girls: *Looking revolted.* (no engagement)

3,29536533,Viktor Krum,Harri,"Viktor: Harri? *hoarse gurgle* Is she - ?

Viktor: *grinning back* Shark no speak.
Bagman: Mister Viktor Krum arrived shortly after and remained with Miss Potter to secure the rescue of all the hostages.
Hermy-own: *smiling knowingly*
Red-haired boy: *gazing at Viktor with grudging respect*
Bagman: Mister Krum had already rescued Miss Granger but he returned to assist Miss Potter."
4,29536533,Viktor,Harri,"Viktor: They were both tied in second place. *Viktor's heart leapt.*
Harri: They wouldn't have to worry about anything until June. *Harri looked like she could hardly believe what she heard.*
Viktor: He had tentatively asked his parents in their last letter if they would be all right with it but they wrote back that they would be delighted to have any friend over, even if his mother had wrote the word 'friend' up to interpretation. *Viktor was already planning to ask Harri to visit him in Bulgaria.*
Viktor: He tried to get Harri's attention again, hoping to pull her away and escape from everyone for a brief moment for just the two of them, but Hermy-own and the red-haired boy were hugging Harri and clapping her on the back and Harri was laughing. *Viktor supposed he could wait a little bit longer to ask.*
Viktor: Rita Skeeter wrote an unflattering piece on him, Harri and Hermy-own, saying it was a tragic love triangle of betrayal and romance, embellishing the events of the second task. *The article eagerly implied Hermy-own was ambitiously trying to steal her best friend's crush and worm her way into his affections and that Harri had terrible judgment when it came to choosing friends. Meanwhile Viktor was portrayed as an oblivious, air-headed boy who couldn't choose between two girls.*
Viktor: While trying to figure out how on earth the reporter listened in on his and Harri's private conversation, Viktor was busy fending off mail from disappointed fans that he was taken, along with questions from his concerned Quidditch teammates who wanted to know if any of it was actually true (one teammate offered to find this Rita Skeeter and hex her for the slander; Viktor politely declined, he didn't want more trouble), while also dodging multiple girls at the school who demanded to have an audience with him to prove they were far better suited for him than either mentioned girl.
Harri: Despite vocally explaining many times that the article was highly exaggerating things and Hermy-own would never do that to Harri, they both received several contemptuous letters the last few days. *Some scathingly asked if they were trying to fan their own egos and become famous by stealing a popular Quidditch player. A few Howlers burst into horrid shrieks and their insults lingered long in the Great Hall afterwards.*
Viktor: Viktor was frowning as he visited Harri in the hospital wing one day who was nursing swollen blistering fingers from her last mail that was coated in undiluted bubotuber pus. *Hermy-own was sitting next to her, looking just as miserable and wincing at the painful fish-like scales that erupted all the way up to her elbows. One letter she opened contained a spiteful curse.*
Viktor: He was telling them his own experiences with hate mail and how one time a letter exploded in his hands and singed his eyebrows and hair just before he had an interview with the Daily Prophet when Ron Veasley entered the hospital wing with a dark scowl on his face. *Viktor thought it was because he was here and was wondering if he should leave but Harri quickly explained that Ron Veasley got detention after he hexed Malfoy for saying Harri and Hermy-own must have slipped Viktor a love potion and they were taking turns sharing him.*
Viktor: I know curses. School teach many. *Viktor gave a meaningful look at Ron.*
Ron: *Ron Veasley eyed him suspiciously.*"
5,29536533,Viktor,Ron,"Viktor: I know curses, *gave a meaningful look at Ron.*
Ron: *eyed him suspiciously.*
Viktor: *thought Ron believed he was trying to sabotage Harri or had intentions with her that were less than chaste.*
Ron: Do you know one to turn Malfoy's face inside out? *sounded hopeful.*
Viktor: *already with his parents when Harri arrived for the champions' family gathering.*
Dog: *bound towards her and began licking Harri's face.*
Harri: Snuffles! How are you here? Is it – is he all right to be here?
Sandy-haired man: We discussed it with Dumbledore already. He sees no harm in having family come support you.
Dog: *happily barked.*
Harri: I'm happy you could make it. *enveloping the dog in a tight embrace.*
Viktor's mother: Viktor, where are your manners? *sternly said in Bulgarian.*
Viktor: Introduce us? Right now?
Viktor's father: It would be good to meet the girl who we heard about for months now. Come then.
Sandy-haired man: *glanced questioningly at Harri.*
Dog: *sat up very straight and his eyes narrowed as he edged closer to Harri.*
Harri: Hello Viktor. Hello Mr and Mrs Krum. This is Mrs Weasley and her son Bill. And this is Remus and our dog Snuffles.
Viktor's mother: So this is English Rose. *casting a critical eye on Harri.*
Viktor: Mother!
Harri: Er, my name isn't Rose.
Viktor's mother: Ahh, misunderstanding. I am meaning pretty flower. English Rose he has meet when he writes me. My son calls you pretty flower. Pretty, I see now.
Viktor: *turned red.*
Bill: *expression was stormy like he wanted to demand what exactly was the nature of Viktor and Harri's relationship.*
Dog: *began growling at him.*
Viktor: *wanted the ground to swallow him up.*"
6,29536533,Bill,Viktor,"Bill: You haven't seen Harri either? *asks sympathetically when he saw Viktor's stricken expression.*
Viktor: *shakes his head.*
Ron: No one is telling us anything. Remus and – and Snuffles suddenly left. Who knows where they went. Just what is going on? *kicks at one of the empty beds in frustration.*
Mrs Veasley: *lays a hand on her son's arm.*
Dumbledore: *speaks calmly and clearly that Harri needed rest and peace and no questions until another time.*
Mrs Veasley: *hisses at the rest of the group to be quiet and not bother Harri.*
Harri: You all right, Viktor? *looking at him with concern.*
Viktor: I am vell. And you? *asks.*
Harri: I'm all right. Just tired."
7,29536533,Fleur Delacour,Viktor,"Fleur Delacour: It is nothing. It was not you 'oo shot ze Stunning Spell at me. Zey say zhat man meet with a Dementer. The one 'oo hurt all of us. Pity for zem. *ignoring the mistrustful glares of her classmates who stood off at the side to give them the illusion of privacy*
Viktor: *hoping he would never end up on her bad side*

Dumbledore: requesting that everyone respect her privacy and not ask her any questions or demand that she tell the story of what happened that night.
Viktor: *painfully wondering if this was the end of whatever they had*

Viktor: *catching Harri's eye and to his immense relief, she gave him a little smile and a shy wave*
Harri: *watching him with a bemused expression*

Viktor: May I sit here?
Harri: You know you're going to make people talk.
Viktor: Let that voman say vat she vants.

Fleur Delacour: You must tell me 'ore about 'or brother. I think iz name is Bill? The tall one with long 'air?
Ron: What brother?
Hermy-own: *rolling her eyes*
Harri: *snorting*

Fleur Delacour: *animatedly chattering about getting a job here to improve her English*
Viktor: *talking about his home and how he missed the nearby mountains he used to fly over*
Ron: *engrossed in a Quidditch team debate with Viktor and Har*"
