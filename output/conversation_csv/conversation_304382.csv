0,304382,Sherlock,John,"Sherlock: I'm not talking to anyone.
Lestrade: Who are you writing to?
Sherlock: My boyfriend.
Anderson: You. Have a boyfriend.
Sherlock: That's what I said.
Donovan: How much did you pay for him?
Lestrade: Good on you, Sherlock, but you're at a crime scene. You can text your boy-
Sherlock: I'm asking him about the rate of decay of human livers. It's vital to the case.
Donovan: Why would he know about decaying body parts? Oh god, you've found yourself a serial killer boyfriend, didn't you?
Lestrade: Sherlock! You can't just give out details of an ongoing investigation!
Sherlock: John's a doctor.
Lestrade: What do the Canadians have to do with anything?
Sherlock: John's Canadian. And while he's quite talented, I doubt he can affect the British judicial system from Richmond."
1,304382,Lestrade,Sherlock,"Lestrade: Sherlock! *nearly shouted* What do the Canadians have to do with anything?
Sherlock: *looked at the sky, the why-must-my-brilliance-be-saddled-with-these-tiny-minded-mortals expression set firmly on his face* John's Canadian. And while he's quite talented, I doubt he can affect the British judicial system from Richmond.
Lestrade: Sherlock, *said carefully*, exactly how did you meet, uh, John?
Sherlock: Over the internet.
Donovan: Oh god, *moaned*. Why couldn't you have found yourself a nice serial killer?
Mrs. Hudson: How is your penpal, dear?
Sherlock: He's not my penpal, Mrs. Hudson, he's my boyfriend.
Sherlock: You can't date someone over the internet. Mummy won't approve. MHPiss off. SH
Sherlock: You lot cannot possibly be this stupid! *threw his hands in the air* If John was here, he'd have figured it out ages ago!
Donovan: Oh, will you come off it!
Sherlock: I wouldn't get on it if you lot would do your jobs! Honestly, John-
Donovan: John's not real! He's never been real! He's someone you made up so the rest of us think you're more human or something!
Sherlock: Oh, and what led you to such a brilliant deduction? *practically snarled*. Do share, Sergeant Donovan. I do so enjoy listening to your attempts at logic.
Lestrade: Enough! *barked*. Donovan, secure the scene. Sherlock, with me.
Lestrade: John's real. He has a blog. That's how I found him.
Sherlock: Of course I do! He's a doctor, formerly of the Canadian Forces Medical Services. He's terrible with technology and he-
Lestrade: Have you met him? Do you even know what he looks likes?
Sherlock: I like him for his mind. I couldn't care less what he looks like.
Lestrade: Sherlock, *sighed*. I know this might be hard to hear, but John may not be who you think he is.
Sherlock: I know exactly who he is.
Lestrade: Are you sure? Are you absolutely positive that you know him? The internet can hide a lot about a person. No one can deduce everything from some e-mails and a blog. Not even you.
Sherlock: *looked stricken for a split second*. Look, John might be who he says he is. Or he might be some kid playing you for fun, or a lonely old woman. The point is, you can't know. Not in this sort of situation.
Mrs. Hudson: Oh, I'm afraid you just missed him, Detective Inspector. He left for a case abroad.
Lestrade: It's not in Canada, is it?
Mrs. Hudson: Canada? No, I think I heard him say something about Belarus.
Lestrade: Oh. Well, good. When he comes back, could you tell him to give me a call?"

Lestrade: Oh. Well, good. When he comes back, could you tell him to give me a call?
Sherlock: Of course, dear.

Lestrade: Get your arse over here or I'm handing the entire thing over to Dimmock.
Sherlock: Don't you dare touch that, Anderson!
Lestrade: Sherlock, what did I tell you about crime scenes not being your personal playdates?
Sherlock: *gave him a scathing look*
John: Oh, sorry. I figured I wasn't supposed to be here. I'll just wait outside, Sherlock.
John: Canadian, actually.
Everyone froze.
Lestrade: Canadian, You wouldn't happen to be called John, would you?
John: Uh, yeah. Dr. John Watson. Hello.
John: Should I go?
Sherlock: No. Stay. I'm going to need you.
Donovan: So you're the infamous John.
John: I'm not sure about infamous, but yeah.
Donovan: Are you a serial killer?
John: Um, no.
Donovan: The Freak over there might be.
John: Really? That's weird.
Donovan: Yes, it is.
John: He proposed to me months ago.
Sherlock: Don't be an idiot, we're waiting. Mummy wants a summer wedding.
John: Yeah, well, just remember my visa runs out in a few months.
Sherlock: Hardly. Mycroft's already getting your dual citizenship confirmed. He'll have the papers by Tuesday.
John: Huh. That's...nice. What does your brother do again?
Sherlock: Never mind that, John. Come take a look at the body.
Donovan: Unbelievable.
Lestrade: Yeah.
Donovan: There are so many ways it could have gone wrong. It should have gone all wrong.
Lestrade: Mm.
Donovan: Leave it to him to beat the odds. And get himself a cute boyfriend."
3,304382,Donovan,Sherlock,"Donovan: It could have gone wrong. It should have gone all wrong, Donovan mused.
Sherlock: Mm.
Donovan: Leave it to him to beat the odds. And get himself a cute boyfriend. Donovan sighed. There's no justice in the world.
Sherlock: *whooped, seized John by the collar, and kissed him thoroughly.*
Donovan: *watched avidly.* Oh my.
Lestrade: You got something, Sherlock?
Sherlock: Twins! Sherlock shouted as he ran past them. Come along, John!
John: *trotted after him, waving cheerfully at Lestrade and Donovan as he passed by.*
Lestrade: God help us. There are two of them.
Donovan: I wonder if we'll be invited to the wedding?"
