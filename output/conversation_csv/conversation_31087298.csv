0,31087298,Harry,Tom,"Harry: Aren't you a bit young to be hoarding trophies like a serial killer?
Tom: Aren't you a bit young to adopt me?
Harry: Touché, child.
Tom: You just skipped weeks of government-mandated probation, and stacks of paperwork, by declaring that we would make a good family because you had a farm - with lots of rabbits I could kill. And then declared you were also a Satanist with demon powers.
Harry: I mean, it worked. Do you want to stay here? Because I'm hearing that you want to stay here.
Tom: I'll pack.
Harry: Thank you. And leave the weird trophies, they're so unhygienic, I don't want you catching some kind of disease.
Tom: *starts packing his trophies first*
Harry: What are you going to do with a gross bit of ribbon? Tom, seriously, is this your version of being sentimental? I'll get you a whole roll in rainbow colour if you want.
Tom: *pauses, holding Matilda's hair ribbon* Promise me. Swear it.
Harry: *pulls out his wand and ribbons start raining down* It's ribbon, Tom. You're leaving here now, don't cling to these people who mean nothing in the long run. You won't even remember their faces in a year. We're leaving. Don't let them drag you back.
Tom: *looks away and picks up a green ribbon* I'm keeping the tooth.
Harry: I'll get you a dragon one?"
1,31087298,Harry,Tom,"Harry: Don't cling to these people who mean nothing in the long run. You won't even remember their faces in a year. *sits back on heels, looking up at Tom now, and smiles* We're leaving. Don't let them drag you back.
Tom: *looks away first* I'm keeping the tooth.
Harry: I'll get you a dragon one?
Tom: *glances sideways at Harry* This bracelet-
Harry: *cries in exasperation, standing back up* Yes, Tom, whatever you want, if I can't conjure it I'll buy it - within reason. Can we please go soon? I still think they might call the police on me.
Tom: *purse his lips and then drops the satchel and starts walking out*
Harry: *vanishes the leftover ribbon and follows* I take it to mean you have a secondary stash somewhere else and this wardrobe was a decoy?
Tom: *looks over his shoulder, the green ribbon wound tight between his fingers, his skin bleached white around it* I don't need trash, Harry, I have you now.
Harry: Great, now say that again without the terrifying look in your eyes-
Voldemort: Adorable, *as they turn the corner of the hallway, in a pristine three-piece-suit and barely pushing thirty-five, spinning a yew wand in hand*
Harry: *dives for Tom to pull him away* Shove it up your ass-
Voldemort: Do not talk back to Lord Voldemort, *plucking Harry's wand from frozen fingers* I have no qualms about burning this entire building down, you should know that.
Tom: *slips out of his stuck shoes and kicks Voldemort in the shin because his usual torture ability doesn't seem to work on the man*
Voldemort: *looks down at the boy and raises his wand* You...dare defy your father?
Tom: *lectures* Harry says you're my future self. And considering the lack of knowledge on such intense temporal magic, it's not confirmed whether any actions affecting me would also effect you. So go ahead, I'm curious. Let's see if you feel my pain.
Voldemort: *grits his teeth and apparates all three of them*
Tripsy: Young master, Tripsy be-
Tom: *shuffling on the cold floor in only his socks because his shoes got left behind* I want Harry.
Voldemort: *sneers down at the boy with undisguisable anger* You can't have that one, Harry Potter is going to be dead as soon as I find a method to do so.
Tom: *demands* Give him to me in the meantime. If you have no use for him, I don't see why I can't have him.
Voldemort: *leans down, looming over the young boy* He is not yours to have.
Tom: He doesn't act like he's yours either.
Harry: *starts banging on the barrier at this point, only seeing black tiles from his side and panicking because he doesn't know what Voldemort is going to do to Tom* Voldemort, you little bitch, if you hurt Tom I'll-
Voldemort: *plunges through the tiles and grabs Harry by the collar, slamming Harry up against a wall*"
2,31087298,Voldemort,Tom,"Voldemort: He is not yours to have.
Tom: He doesn't act like he's yours either.
Harry: Voldemort, you little bitch, if you hurt Tom I'll-
Voldemort: You are alive because you are my horcrux. Do not think you piecing my soul together means anything. Lord Voldemort is not dictated by a soul, I am not a simple-minded, unevolved-
Harry: *claws at the wrist, looking wild-eyed up at a furious Voldemort*
Voldemort: We will continue this discussion later. Stay in the manor and do try not to get yourself killed.
Tom: Let me deal with it.
Harry: Tom, *hiding the wand behind his back*
Tom: Are you leaving me?
Harry: No, no. I'm just...I can't stay here.
Tom: You adopted me! We're meant to be a family.
Harry: We need to get away from him. You can come with me.
Tom: He's too powerful, we don't have supplies, he has too many allies that we know nothing about.
Harry: Okay. Okay, Tom, but if he hurts us then we leave, okay? Please, Tom?
Tom: Okay.
Harry: Partners. I'm not a servant or anything.
Harry: Well, I suppose brother-husband does our relationship justice.
Harry: You see, I am also a Parselmouth, of the noble Gaunt line. Marvolo is my older brother and Tom here is our son - by magical means of course. You understand how important it is to keep the line pure.
Tom: *makes the subtle hand sign for 'Harry is doing a thing again, you need to stop him'*
Harry: Why, my mother -who is also Marvolo's mother may I remind you- is the niece of our father. When Tom here grows up, we'll match him up with Marvolo, as is traditional. Quite the scandal but our sixteen-greats aunt, twice removed, fucked a house elf and we've been quite busy purging it from the line-
Voldemort: Harry.
Harry: Oh, there you are, husband-brother."

Voldemort: Harry, *towering over the teenager*
Harry: Oh, there you are, husband-brother.
Voldemort: Leave. Before I hurt you.
Harry: Okay, *chokes out and leaves*
Voldemort: Pardon him, he thinks he's funny.
Woman: So, Marvolo, the lovely Harry is your...partner?
Voldemort: He's a nanny for my child, *placing a long-fingered hand on Tom's shoulder* I don't believe I've introduced Thomas to you yet.
Voldemort: I swear he's immortal.
Tom: Are you jealous?
Voldemort: Don't test me, boy.
Voldemort: Ah, Harry, there you are, *walking across the Ministry atrium*
Dumbledore: Harry dear, this is Albus Dumbledore, *hands like claws in Harry's shoulders* And - oh, is that Black calling me over? You two talk, I'll come back to pick you up, darling.
Harry: Um, I was looking for the bathroom?
Dumbledore: Right this way!
Voldemort: Put the book away, it won't teach you anything useful at this stage of your education.
Tom: I would like to read it anyway.
Voldemort: I will not have you wasting your time when there is so much other information you need to catch up on.
Tom: Just know that you forced my hand.
Harry: Ow, stop!
Tom: Harry, he hexed me!
Voldemort: Harry, he's a liar! All he does is lie. I'm not even holding a wand.
Harry: Hurt him again, I'll burn down your library!
Harry: I know where you can get basilisk ingredients.
Voldemort: *pinches his back*
Harry: *jolts and grabs at Voldemort's large hand*
Voldemort: *lays the papers from the finished Wizengamot session neatly inside a folder and sighs*
Harry: You're taking a while."
4,31087298,Voldemort,Harry,"Voldemort: You're taking a while, *the patronus reforms into a massive stag beside him* Me and Tom are going to head off to lunch first.
Harry: *The patronus flickers away* Tom and I.
Voldemort: Apologies, it seems I'm late for lunch.
Harry: Oh my, *reading the newspaper over breakfast* How romantic of Dumbledore to reveal your clandestine meetings by so boldly whispering sweet nothings to you in front of-
Voldemort: *taps his wand on the table* I'm constantly surprised that Harry's not dead yet.
Tom: I can't, *stirring some sugar into his tea* He's holding my soul hostage.

Gellert Grindelwald: -won't even talk to me anymore.
Voldemort: *sickened at the thought of having just been conned into a duel for Dumbledore's love*
Harry: Um, *slowly* Actually, Volde â€“ Marvolo and I aren't really together.
Grindelwald: Is it the incest thing?
Harry: That was actually a joke.
Grindelwald: Nonsense, you two are practically soulmates.
Voldemort: *chokes on his tea and coughs*
Grindelwald: No, *leaning forward with an elbow propped up on his knee* Dark magic I'm assuming.
Voldemort: It won't work for your situation, ours isâ€¦special."
5,31087298,Grindelwald,Voldemort,"Grindelwald: Do tell, *leans forward with an elbow propped up on his knee* Dark magic I'm assuming.
Voldemort: It won't work for your situation, ours is...special. *grits out the last word like he tastes something disgusting*
Grindelwald: *sighs and sits back again* Honestly, I have such Albus-withdrawal I'm willing to just throw a love potion at him-
Harry: *quickly looking away from Voldemort's slowly worsening death glare* Anyway! Love potions definitely won't endear you to Dumbledore. I recommend giving him some time-
Voldemort: *cuts in* Take him on a holiday. Teaching at Hogwarts and attending so many Wizengamot sessions, oh my, Dumbledore must be exhausted.
Harry: *waits for the catch*
Voldemort: *continues, perfectly pleasant* Take him to Germany. Tour the world, keep him occupied. Away from Britain. Actually, put him in Nurmengard until the Stockholm Syndrome sets in. And then keep him there anyway.
Harry: *tries* Or you could respect his wishes and not force him into a relationship.
Tom: *walks into the room and clambers up onto the couch between Harry and Voldemort, taking the tea Harry hands him and accepting the napkin Voldemort places over his lap because Tom still drops crumbs when he eats biscuits*
Grindelwald: A child.
Harry: No.
Voldemort: Yes, a child. Get Dumbledore a German one. Not in Britain.
Grindelwald: *states excitedly* He couldn't possibly say no to the father of his child.
Harry: *rushes out quickly* Please don't steal a small kid.
Tom: *raises an eyebrow up at Harry* He says, like a hypocrite.
Albus: *opens the door to his homey little cottage he putters around in while Hogwarts isn't in session and freezes in shock*
Gellert: *says* Look what I made, *turning and gesturing smugly to a little blond-haired boy waiting further out along with a trunk of luggage*
Albus: *whispers* How dare you.
Gellert: *laughs* Oh, mein Liebester, it is not-
Albus: *punches him in the face* You! Gellert, you- *takes gasping breaths* Have you come to mock me?!
Gellert: *laughs* My soul and my heart, mein Sonne und mein Stern.
Albus: *braces his feet and yanks away* You thought I managed to get it up for a woman long enough to cheat on you and then came to brag."
6,31087298,Albus,Gellert,"Albus: Mein Liebester, *pauses, eyes wide. He looks away, lips pursed.*
Gellert: Really? What, you thought I managed to get it up for a woman long enough to cheat on you and then came to brag about it?
Albus: Why is there a child that looks like you?
Gellert: Well he was meant to look like both of us but it was a rushed job.
Albus: That explains nothing!
Gellert: If you have our child to look after, you can't run off to war.
Albus: Gellert.
Gellert: And you can't keep ignoring me. And you'll have to let me visit. And, really, for the sake of the child's development we should stop fighting.
Albus: Who...how did you do it?
Gellert: Technically it's a younger version of myself that I just tweaked a bit. Okay, actually, the only thing I changed was to make him asexual because I am not fighting him for your love – that would be ridiculous.
Albus: Yes, that would be the most ridiculous thing you've done today.
Gellert: I have neighbours. They're going to see me...cavorting with a Dark Lord.
Albus: I'm sure they're used to it with all those newspaper articles circulating recently. I'll be coming around more often anyway. Unless you'd like to move to Germany with me, Marvolo did recommend I show you Nurmengard.
Albus: You've been talking with Slytherin. I didn't know Dark Lords had a little self-help group. How to stop your enemy from defeating you; give them a child to take care of.
Gellert: Interestingly enough, Marvolo is also quite stuck, unable to kill Harry. But they live together rather peacefully – okay no, that's a blatant lie, but they attempt to be peaceable and little Tom is...strange but well-adjusted enough.
Albus: You are an adult.
Gellert: I am whatever you want me to be, mein Liebester.
Albus: How about you be a good person?
Gellert: *pauses.*
Albus: The problem, Gellert, isn't if I love you. It's if I love you enough to overlook all the horrible things you're doing. I don't. I can't.
Gellert: You know my visions. You know what the muggles will do. You know how much wizards can help if only we didn't have to hide our nature as if we are abnormal.
Albus: And you've gone straight to suppressing them like that's the only option. Gellert, you know, we've done it often enough - it's the leaders that tell people to kill, that convince them to. Power hungry muggles do not speak for a whole race, just like you do not speak for all wizardkind.
Gellert: Then help me be better, we'll make plans like when we were teenagers.
Albus: You won't listen.
Gellert: We have a child together, can't you see I'm trying?
Albus: Trying what? You've brought me a living, breathing little boy as a bargaining chip, so you can tie me to you. What part of that is trying?
Gellert: I am helping people, for the greater good."

Gellert: I am helping people, for the greater good.
Albus: The difference between you and me, Gellert, is that I have grown up from childish plans to take over the world. *shoving Gellert's arms away one last time and turning to head back inside to escape using the floo because Gellert has set up anti-apparition wards.*
Gellert: I'll stop the violence.
Albus: *pauses* No. No, you won't.
Gellert: I don't have time to do it the political way before the muggles start their war. But I could, with you. If you join me.
Albus: *hesitates*"
