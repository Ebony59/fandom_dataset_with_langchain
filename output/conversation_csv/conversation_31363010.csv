0,31363010,Severus,Filius,"Filius: Hello, Severus, are you all right?
Severus: Yes. Have you seen my husband anywhere?
Filius: Yes, last I saw he had just entered your quarters.
Severus: Thank you.
Severus: I discovered that someone was stealing from the Prince vaults, and that not only am I Lord Prince, but Lord Ravenclaw.
Regulus: I thought your grandfather-
Severus: I am the last living male heir. He had no choice.
Regulus: Sev, what's wrong?
Severus: Nothing, more or less.
Regulus: What is it?
Severus: Would you like me to be blunt or warm up to it?
Regulus: Blunt.
Severus: I have a son.
Regulus: What?
Severus: It happened before we began courting.
Regulus: Who's the mother?"
1,31363010,Severus,Reg,"Severus: I have a son, Severus said tiredly.
Reg: What? he choked.
Severus: It happened before we began courting, he said quietly.
Reg: Who's the mother?
Severus: Lily, Severus said dryly.
Reg: Severus, your son is Harry Potter?
Severus: Apparently, she named him Harrison Regulus Snape, Severus said, frowning a little.
Reg: When are we going to adopt him?
Severus: You... you want...
Reg: He's your son, too, love, Reg said simply.
Severus: Severus smashed his lips on Reg's, who let out a muffled yelp before moaning and kissing him back.

Severus: What do you mean you can't find my son? Severus growled.
Regulus: He is hidden behind very powerful wards, Axeclaw explained.
Severus: I can't very well ask Dumbledore where he put the child, Severus groaned.
Axeclaw: You could ask Remus Lupin-Black.
Reg: Sev, he considers Harrison his cub, Reg reminded him gently.
Severus: Severus muttered under his breath about stupid werewolves, but finally he agreed.

Regulus: Severus, my boy!
Severus: What do you want now, old man? Severus snapped irritably.
Dumbledore: Having a son, of course!
Severus: Albus, for the last time, Severus snapped, you do not legally have control over my son! He is biologically mine, meaning I am his magical guardian, and I am going to raise him. Now tell me where he is!
Regulus: Severus, I thought I heard you shouting, his dear husband said calmly as he entered, bearing a letter.
Dumbledore: He is safe, Albus repeated.
Severus: Severus, I thought I heard you shouting, his dear husband said calmly as he entered, bearing a letter.
Regulus: Yes, Headmaster. He and Amelia have transferred Harrison's guardianship to his biological father and are currently looking for him.
Dumbledore: It would help them out very much, Headmaster, if you told them where you put my husband's son, Regulus crooned.
Severus: You gave him to Petunia? Severus snarled. Are you mad?! She hates magicals! You have just sent my son to his death!
Dumbledore: She is family, Dumbledore said brightly.
Severus: Lily created a Blood-Protection, which is why Harry survived, Dumbledore explained.
Severus: Which would work with me as well! He is related to me by"
2,31363010,Severus,Harry,"Severus: I'm sure she loves Harry. You don't want to take him away from a happy home, do you? *spat* Why would you give a magical child to a magic-hating Muggle?!
Dumbledore: Lily created a Blood-Protection, which is why Harry survived.
Severus: Which would work with me as well! He is related to me by blood!
Dumbledore: I also wanted to keep Harry away from his fame, I'm sure the boy wouldn't want to be swarmed constantly by fans.
Regulus: Well, it's a good thing Severus and I wanted to take a break from teaching and visit his island.
Dumbledore: Island?
Severus: Reg, my love, it is your island as well. You are married to me, Consort Ravenclaw-Prince.
Regulus: Oh, yes, I forgot, dear.
Severus: You are descended from Ravenclaw as well?
Dumbledore: Yes, I was surprised, but pleased, when my Gringotts accountant told me I was also Lord Ravenclaw.
Regulus: Where is Severus' son?
Lupin: Sorry I'm late. You said you wanted me to track Harrison?
Severus: When do you need Moony?
Remus: Now, if you're free.
Regulus: You never answered my question. Are you all right, Remus?
Remus: As well as anyone can be with their mate locked up.
Regulus: You can come stay with us, you know that. Especially once we find Harrison.
Severus: For Merlin's sake, Lu -- Remus, I am a Potions Master, I can brew Wolfsbane for you.
Regulus: We're not taking no for an answer. Let's go get Harrison first, and then we can move you to one of our guest rooms.
Severus: Cannot let me, my a**! He is my son, and you cannot stop me.
Severus: Hello, Tuney. Where is Harrison?
Petunia: I don't know who you're talking about.
Remus: Harry Potter? My cub?
Petunia: Vernon! We have... guests! Bring the freak!
Severus: Give me my child.
Muggle man: Yours? Well, of course she would cheat, freak she wa-
Amelia: Petunia and Vernon Dursley, you are under arrest for child abuse.
Dursley: WHAT!"
3,31363010,Remus,Amelia,"Remus: Well, of course she would cheat, freak she wa- *snarling in the background*
Amelia: Petunia and Vernon Dursley, you are under arrest for child abuse. *half-heartedly trying to hold the angry werewolf back*
Lucius: Back against the wall.
Severus: *rubbing the distressed child's back gently* Where's the baby formula?
Petunia: Second cupboard to the left of the fridge.
Reg: What do we do with the brat?
Amelia: Mr. Dursley will be given to a Muggle orphanage.
Severus: Are you hungry, little one? *offering the child the bottle*
Reg: Thanks. *disappeared up the stairs*
Amelia: I suggest you take the child's things to your manor, Severus, Regulus.
Severus: Thank you, Amelia.
Reg: We can't find his room.
Severus: I wouldn't put it past her to put him in a closet or cupboard.
Remus: *sniffing the air* Hurt cub.
Harrison: Un Moo'y?
Remus: cupboard under the stairs
Severus: Why didn't he recognize you earlier?
Remus: I don't know.
Severus: I should get him to a healer.
Reg: All that's in there is a crib with an old pillowcase stuffed with cotton balls.
Amelia: Send me his medical report once you have it."
4,31363010,Axeclaw,Severus,"Axeclaw: He blocked a child's magic?! *snarled, eyes flashing with rage.*
Severus: Amelia was furious as well, *said darkly.* She wants to see the extent of the blocks, so she can arrest him as well.
Axeclaw: *pulled a piece of pale green parchment from his desk.* As he is underage, a hair will do.
Severus: *pulled a quill from his pocket and transfigured it into a pair of scissors.* Then, with Harrison watching in a puzzled way, he clipped one hair from his head and placed it on the parchment.
Axeclaw: *tapped the hair, and the paper glowed.* He will need a magical purge, *the goblin said tightly,* but it will be painful.
Severus: I am going to kill him!
Harrison: *flinched and whimpered a little.* Severus quickly pulled him closer and murmured gentle apologies.
Axeclaw: *pulled the paper towards him and growled a little when he read it.* He will have to be here for that, *the goblin pointed out, eyes twinkling.*
Severus: He will. At the moment, he's planning Dumbledore's funeral.
Severus: I could put him to sleep during the ritual, Axeclaw suggested.
Severus: Do that, *Severus said abruptly.* And afterwards I want to Blood-Adopt with Reg."
