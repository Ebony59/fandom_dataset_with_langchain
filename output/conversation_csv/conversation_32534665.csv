0,32534665,Sirius,James,"Sirius: You don’t understand, Pads. I spent so long working on it and I only get an A? You’d think I’d at least get an E.
Sirius: Maybe you should ask Evans to tutor you.
James: That’s not a bad idea. She is very good at charms.
Sirius: And maybe you might get more than just tutoring, eh, Prongs?
James: *snorts in response*
Lily: I finished your dumb crossword puzzle, Potter.
James: How’d you do that?
Lily: I’m just smart, unlike some people. I take it I win this time?
James: I assume so.
Lily: Perfect! That’s seven for me, and two for you. You need to pick up your game, Potter, you’ll be last at this rate.
James: I’ll get there.
Lily: We’ll be waiting, then."
1,32534665,Lily Evans,Regulus Black,"Lily: “I’ll get there,” *a lopsided, mischievous smirk on his face* “We’ll be waiting, then.”
Sirius: *standing right there* “Good to see you, Black.”
Lily: “Same to you, Evans.”
James: “What was that?”
Sirius: “Since when were you so chummy with Evans?”
James: “Yeah. Sorry. That slipped my mind.”
Sirius: “Mate, how do you finally get with the girl you’ve been chasing for years and forget to tell us?”
James: “It’s just like we’re really close friends and just got closer. That’s all.”
Sirius: “When did they even become close friends?”

Remus: *decided to spend a wonderful evening in the library*
Remus: *saw Lily Evans and Regulus Black sitting next to each other at a table in the back of the library, studying together*
Remus: *couldn’t bring it within himself to disturb them at all*
Remus: *seating himself at the table on the other side of the library*
Remus: *had a very nice view of them working together*
Remus: *tried to get to studying*
Remus: *hard to concentrate when two completely polar opposites, personality and just everything else wise, were working together*
Remus: *their fingers were interlaced together on the table*
Remus: *they were whispering and giggling quietly together*
Remus: *determined to crack the enigma of Regulus and Lily*"
2,32534665,Remus,Regulus Black,"Remus: What the fuck. What the actual fuck.
Remus: There was no way—no way—that Remus saw that with his two own eyes.
Remus: If they were dating, it wasn’t like he was not happy for them. Oh no. If they like each other, honestly, good for them. They’re a cute couple anyway.
Remus: Remus still couldn’t wrap his head around it, though.
Remus: The small but intimate action was clear enough indication that Regulus Black and Lily Evans were, indeed, dating.

Peter: James sure did look chummy with a Slytherin, a pureblood whose family was part of the Sacred 28, and was the usual stuck-up, cold wizard. Except the cold, stuck up wizard was anything but cold and stuck up at the moment.
James: Can’t you lose at least one for me?
Regulus: We can’t have you winning, can we?
James: What’s that supposed to mean?
Regulus: That means that I’m not going to lose to her just so you can get ahead.
James: But I thought you loved me…."
3,32534665,Lily,James,"Marlene: “Since when were you so interested in Quidditch?”
Lily: “It’s fun.”
Marlene: “Yeah. I know it’s fun. But since when did you like it so much?”
Lily: “Just then.”
Marlene: *sits back in her seat, arms crossed and frowning, trying to figure it all out*
Marlene: *the crowds burst into cheers, sending Marlene toppling over in fright with a shout*
Marlene: “Lily and James were dating, right?”
Marlene: “James and Lily are dating?”
Sirius: “It seems so.”
Remus: “Wait, what? They’re not dating.”
Sirius: “Sure they are. I saw them twice together?”
Peter: “No, they’re not. James isn’t dating Lily.”
Remus: “I thought Lily and Regulus were dating.”
Sirius: “Seriously? Regulus?”
Remus: “Hey, I just saw them in the library. Just stating facts here.”
Marlene: “But I saw Lily all close to James in Charms!”
Marlene: “And I saw Lily and James in the Quidditch pitch today!”
Sirius: “Exactly!”
Peter: “But… I saw James and Regulus in the corridor the other day?”
Sirius: “You’re joking.”
Peter: “I’m not!”
Remus: “No way, Regulus is dating Lily. I legitimately saw them with my own two eyes, and they were so…couple-y.”
Peter: “Well, James and Regulus were even more couple-y, I bet. And Regulus was so smooth as well, you should’ve seen James’s face.”
Marlene: “Lily seemed so invested in Quidditch today, it was obviously because of James. And her face when Gryffindor won!”
Sirius: “Thank you, Marlene! I don’t know where Reg even came from, but it seems highly improbable.”
Remus: “I honest to God saw them in the library, I wasn’t hallucinating.”
Peter: “And I’m not imagining Regulus and James in the corridor.”"
4,32534665,Sirius,Remus,"Sirius: “I don’t know where Reg even came from, but it seems highly improbable.”
Remus: “I honest to God saw them in the library, I wasn’t hallucinating. And I checked.”
Peter: “And I’m not imagining Regulus and James in the corridor. I couldn’t come up with that if I tried.”

Lily: “So that’s one more for James. Told you I’d beat you.” *adds another tally to James’s column*
James: “You’re the one who was being weird in the first place during the match, what do you expect me to do?”
Regulus: “You never said flirting while on brooms was not valid.”
James: “I see how it is. Flirt with the seeker so your seeker wins. That’s playing dirty, Potter.”
Regulus: “The team wasn’t pleased at all, thanks to this guy.”
James: “Hey, I played fair and square!”
Regulus: “Sure you did.”
James: “Okay, show me where it says that I can’t flirt in the match.”
Regulus: “Add that to next week’s list, I’m gonna beat his ass.”
Lily: “As I was saying, I’ve got the standings for this week. There’s James with five, Regulus with nine, and me, I’ve got ten.”
Regulus: “I’m calling bullshit. Literally what do I gotta do to beat you?”
Lily: “Be better than me. But that’s a stretch for you.”
Regulus: “No, really, I’m calling bullshit. No way I didn’t beat you!”
Lily: “The numbers don’t lie, Black!”
James: “I’m not allowed to speak.”
Lily: “By whose word?”
Regulus: “Mine.”
Lily: “Aw, come on, don’t”"
5,32534665,Regulus,Lily,"Regulus: *studying the chart* *lets out a sigh of frustration*

Lily: Was I lying? *smugly* *crosses arms*

Regulus: *chucks the parchment at her* I hate you.

Lily: You love me. *corrects*

Regulus: *rolls his eyes* Sure.

Lily: Aw, come on, don't be like that!

Regulus: Yeah, when I win next week.

James: And maybe I'll pass five next week. *snorts*

Regulus: Now that's unlikely.

James: *frowns sullenly*

Lily: *bursts into laughter*

James: That's it, I'm leaving you two. Go off by yourselves. See if I care.


Lily: *rests her head on James's shoulder*

James: You guys wanna go in for dinner?

Regulus: That would be ideal."
