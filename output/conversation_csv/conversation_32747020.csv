0,32747020,Rose,Draco,"Rose: Dracoooooo, Draco, you awake? *pokes him in the eye*
Draco: Go back to bed.
Rose: *jumps onto his chest* Fuc- *covers his mouth* Mommy says you can't swear, even when she's away.
Draco: Why are you out of bed?
Rose: I had a bad dream. Will you grab Draco, he fell.
Draco: I saw a monster in my closet.
Rose: I did, honest! Aunt Luna said that there's spurts in here, they moved into my closet and gave me nightmares.
Draco: Would you like me to check your closet?
Rose: *shakes her head* Can I stay with you?
Draco: No.
Rose: Please?
Draco: No.
Rose: I won't kick!
Draco: You always kick.
Rose: I promise, please please please.
Draco: Your mom isn't going to be happy with you sleeping in our bed."
1,32747020,Draco,Rose,"Draco: Your mom isn't going to be happy with you sleeping in our bed, *he answered weakly*. Don't tell her.
Rose: Go to sleep, Rose, *Draco said to the six-year-old tiredly*. When mommy has the baby will they call you daddy?
Draco: Well, not for a while. Babies can't talk, you know, *he replied, smirking when Rose huffed*.
Rose: But when they can talk, they will?
Draco: I think so.
Rose: Should I call you dad? *She asked curiously*."
2,32747020,Draco,Rose,"Draco: Do you want to call me dad?
Rose: I like calling you Draco.
Draco: *reaches down and pokes her side, smiling when she squeals* Now go to sleep or I'm giving you to the wackspruts.
Rose: You wouldn't.
Draco: I would.
Rose: *grumbles, but pulls the duvet to her chin and gets comfortable* Night Draco. Love you. *falls asleep*

Hermione: Draco, we made a deal.
Draco: She had a nightmare.
Hermione: We can't let her sleep with us. What if she becomes codependent?
Draco: *tucks a curl behind her ear and chuckles* Rose could never be codependent. What we can stop doing is allowing Lovegood to come into our home and filling her head with that nonsense.
Hermione: *opens her mouth to respond, but Draco pulls her in for a lingering kiss* Why don't I make breakfast and you tell me how your trip was? *Hermione rolls her eyes and nods*"
3,32747020,Draco,Hermione,"Draco: And you say you won't be a good father. *wears a smirk on her face*
Hermione: Oh, Draco I- *worried her bottom between her teeth* I had no idea she was going to ask you that, or that she was even thinking about that at all.
Draco: Yeah, I didn't either, but leave it to Rose to always throw a fast bat at us.
Hermione: Curve ball. *raised her hands in surrender, a smile curving on her lips* Sorry, sorry.
Hermione: What's happening in there? *brushing her fingertips along his temple* Talk to me.
Draco: I just... *let out a heavy breath* I'm not Rose's father.
Hermione: No, you aren't. *took his hand, lacing their fingers* You knew I had a kid going into this I-
Draco: You know that isn't it. *said adamantly* I love the both of you.
Hermione: That won't happen. *took Draco's face into her hands* Do you want to know why? *leans onto her toes and pressed a swift kiss to his lips* Because Rose loves you."
4,32747020,Rose,Draco,"Draco: Because Rose loves you, *she said firmly*.
Hermione: When I pick her up from school and it's just me, she deflates, even if it's just for a second. She wants to see you at the end of the day. When she has a nightmare, it's your name she cries, you who has to check the closet and under the bed for monsters. You're the one who does those things and more because you are the one that Rose thinks of when she thinks of her father figure. *Her thumbs brushed over his cheeks and she smiled up at him*, Blood doesn't define what you mean in her life.
Draco: *let out a heavy breath, wrapping his arms around Hermione's waist*. For a moment, the two of them stood there in each other's embrace. A million responses ran through his mind, one more self-deprecating than the next. But as their bedroom door slammed open, and their eyes turned to the small child padding into the room, he couldn't help but think that maybe, just maybe, Hermione was right after all.

Draco: Bloody gymnastics, *he grumbled*, holding his coffee tightly in his hand, his other hand held firmly in Hermione's.
Hermione: She's fine, *Hermione reminded him*, leaning in to speak in his ear. You worry too much.
Draco: She struggles on the ground, *Draco retorted*. Can't imagine her not falling off of the balance beam. Gods, why did you agree to let her do this?
Hermione: IF she does, *Hermione said*, ignoring his question as she squeezed his hand. We will be right here.
Draco: *With a heavy sigh, Draco nodded his head, turning to kiss Hermione's temple*. You're right, I'm sorry.
Hermione: Don't apologize, *Hermione replied*. Why don't you grab me a pretzel, and I'll keep my eye on her. I know watching her makes you queasy. *Her tone was teasing, but it was true*."
5,32747020,Draco,Hermione,"Draco: I'll be right back. *takes one last look at Rose*
Hermione: *smiles and waves at Draco*
Draco: *walks through the halls, finds the concession stand*
Draco: *ready to awkwardly laugh and agree*
Rose: Daddy!
Draco: *drops the pretzel and fizzy drink*
Draco: *darts in the direction of the noise*
Draco: *gets back to the gymnasium, sees Rose crying*
Draco: What happened?
Hermione: *mouths she's okay*
Rose: *reaches for Draco*
Draco: *pulls Rose into his arms*
Hermione: She fell- she's fine-
Draco: *squeezes Hermione's hand*
Coach: We've got an ambulance coming if you all would like her to ride there to go to the hospital.
Hermione: That's okay, we can take her ourselves, I'm sure it isn't a break.
Coach: Don't think so, a sprain at best, but the medic'll need to take a look at it.
Hermione: I think we'll just take her to the hospital.
Draco: *relieved nod*
Hermione: Are you okay, sweetheart?
Draco: Why don't we get you checked out?
Rose: *nods*"
6,32747020,Draco,Rose,"Draco: Why don't we get you checked out? *brushes a few stray strands of hair away from her face*
Rose: *nods*
Draco: *looks over to Hermione* Thank you for coming in and checking on her.
Hermione: How're you feeling honey?
Rose: I feel okay, kind of hungry.
Draco: *moves to pull her close to him* I'm sorry you got hurt.
Hermione: *smiling up at him* Just be with her. I know you were shaken.
Draco: It's not your fault. Accidents happen.
Rose: I'm sorry.
Draco: What are you apologizing for, Rose?
Rose: *sobs* That I got hurt.
Draco: Rose, sweetie, look at me. *wipes away a few stray tears* That wasn't your fault."
7,32747020,Draco,Rose,"Draco: Rose, sweetie, look at me. *reached out and brushed Rose's hair out of her face* That wasn't your fault, accidents happen.
Rose: But, you're mad at me. *voice was soft and timid*
Draco: I'm not mad. *soothingly running his hand over her hair* I was scared... really scared, and when I saw you crying I thought something really bad had happened to you. *clears his throat* I was mad at myself that I wasn't there to grab you.
Rose: Mummy said you were getting snacks. *keeping her eyes on Draco as the door to the hospital room opened* But I didn't see you, did you drop them?
Draco: I did. *rubbing his thumb along her cheek* Made a huge mess. *his eyes darted to the door* But let's not tell mummy that. *smiles when Rose closed her lips, dragging her fingers across them and making a locking motion at the corner*
Rose: I changed my mind. *keeping her eyes on Draco as the door to the hospital room opened* When the baby comes, I wanna call you daddy too.
Draco: You can call me whatever you want. *trying to keep his cool*
Rose: I like calling you dad. *with a nod*
Draco: I like being your dad. *a genuine smile gracing his lips* I love you.
Rose: This much? *extends her arms out as far as they could go*
Draco: That much, maybe even more.
Hermione: I love you both, so much. *reaching out to pull them both into an embrace*
Draco: *hugs back tightly, wanted them both to feel all the love he had for them*
Rose: You're crushing me!
Draco: *laughs*
Draco: *leans in, pressing a tender kiss to Hermione's lips*"
