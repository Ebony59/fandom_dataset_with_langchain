0,3382706,Rigel,James,"Rigel: Where was he? *raising her head, staring up at the ceiling* Her big brother had abandoned her. He truly wanted nothing to do with their family. It wasn't just her he failed – Andromeda, Bellatrix, and Narcissa also needed him. With Sirius gone, he left them all unprotected, and her parents knew it.
Rigel: *a few sobs escaped* She was doomed. Her life was over. *burying her head in her knees, sobbing* Her dreams of love, and children were gone. There was no way he would never love her.
James: Miss Black, *holding out a silk handkerchief* Thank you, Heir Potter. *moving to sit next to her* Where's my brother?
Rigel: He's not coming. *resting her head against the wall, staring up at the ceiling* There goes the Ancient and Noble House of Black. *whispering*"
1,3382706,James,Rigel,"James: Don't look so surprised. We've been in decline for awhile, and we'll be gone by the next generation.
Rigel: Walburga betrothed me – and my cousins.
James: What did you want to see Sirius about?
Rigel: The Dark Lord.
James: You went after I told you it was nothing important.
Rigel: It is. You have your duties to fulfill.
James: Your sister's betrothed to the Dark Lord.
Rigel: There won't be any hope for the Black family next generation.
James: You need to fix this. As Heir Black, it's your responsibility to oversee all betrothal contracts for your generation. You have the authority to reject or accept any contracts.
Sirius: Fine.
James: Good, we'll be leaving for Diagon Alley in the morning."
2,3382706,James,Rigel,"James: Fine.
James: Good, we'll be leaving for Diagon Alley in the morning.
James: You can have the bed.
Rigel: *her eyes widened*
...
Rigel: Morning, James.
James: *stretched and stood up* Morning, Rigel.
Rigel: *blushed*
James: *smiled at Rigel* I'll show you sometime.
Rigel: Did you get through to Sirius?
James: We're going to Gringotts today.
Rigel: Can you make sure he betroths Bellatrix to Lucius?
James: What about you?
Narcissa: Franklin Longbottom, if he'll have me.
James: *nodded*
Sirius: Ready to go?
James: *nodded*"
3,3382706,Sirius,James,"Sirius: Ready to go? *walks over to the group*
James: *nods* Yeah, let's go. *stands up*
Andromeda: Are you two coming? *looks at Sirius' cousins*
Cousins: *share a look and nod*
Andromeda: I'll send Bellatrix a message once we get to Diagon Alley.
Sirius: *nods*
Bellatrix: *runs into the bank and joins her sisters*
Sirius: I would like to dissolve the existing betrothal contracts concerning my cousins and my sister. They were authorized without my permission.
Goldbloom: I can assist you, for a fee.
Sirius: Any fee you insist on. Please, take it from the main vault.
Goldbloom: Of course, Heir Black. With the termination of these contracts, am I correct in assuming you wish to draw up new ones?
Sirius: Yes.
Sirius: Narcissa, anyone in particular?
Narcissa: Franklin Longbottom, son of Augusta and Alexander.
Sirius: *looks at his sister and James* How serious was James about Rigel?"
4,3382706,Sirius Black,Rigel Black,"Sirius: I, Sirius Black, Heir of the Ancient and Noble House of Black, son of Orion and Walburga Black, authorize a betrothal contract between Rigel Black, daughter of Orion and Walburga Black, and James Potter, Heir of the Ancient and Noble House of Potter, and son of Charlus and Dorea Potter.
Rigel: *eyes widened*
James: I, James Potter, Heir of the Ancient and Noble House of Potter, son of Charlus and Dorea Potter, hereby accept the betrothal contract with Rigel Black, daughter of the House of Black, as authorized by Heir Sirius Black.
Sirius: Take care of my sister, Prongs.
James: *nodded and stood up, offering his hand to Rigel*
Rigel: *in a daze, took the offered hand*
James: What ring do you want? *leading Rigel out of the room* He wanted to give her one from his family's vault. Rigel would understand the value and meaning behind it. Using an old ring strengthened the bonds between the witch and her new family."
