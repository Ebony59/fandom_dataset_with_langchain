0,"346797,",Sherlock,John,"Sherlock: You're not sleeping with me.
John: Why not? It's perfectly reasonable to wish to test this hypothesis and you already live with me anyway.
Sherlock: You're NOT. Sleeping. With me.
Sherlock: But John, there have been many claims already made that sleeping with a bedfellow improves the quality of sleep. I honestly see nothing against sharing a bed with me for a certain amount of time to serve as a sleep study of sorts. It would have been incredibly useful data for this case.
John: Just the fact that you see nothing against it is reason enough to say no. If there's studies out there already can't you just take those at face value?
Sherlock: What could you possibly have against sharing a bed for a brief period of time? Are you worried people might talk? The walls of my bedroom aren't made of glass, John, London won't be able to see us, nobody has to know.
John: People already talk, that's hardly the problem. Are you worried something might actually happen? Fascinating.
John: I am not - Sherlock. No. I just feel I've given up enough of my privacy living with you as it is, can I please keep a couple of hours to myself every night?
Sherlock: It'll just be for a week or two."
1,"346797,",Sherlock,John,"Sherlock: It'll just be for a week or two, *turns with a huff, the housecoat swishing around him dramatically.*
John: No.
Sherlock: We'd aim for a set number of hours of sleep every night, perhaps the common eight, and see if it makes a difference with our usual sleeping habits when there is a partner present, *both leaned over the headless corpse of what, judging by the unusual outfit, appears to be an aging circus clown.*
John: No.
Sherlock: I'm sure it's got to do with natural instinct, after all when sleeping with another present there are two individuals who might detect potential predators and subconsciously one might feel safer and therefore sleep more deeply, *prowling about the campsite of an almost abandoned circus, the scent of sawdust and old cotton candy tickling up John's nose.*
John: No.
Sherlock: I suppose going to sleep every night at midnight and sleeping until 8 would be good, and not too difficult to make work with your shifts at the surgery, *slumped behind a dumpster painted an alarming shade of yellow while behind them a very angry aging acrobat waves a gun in Lestrade's general direction.*
John: For God's sake.
Sherlock: If the hypothesis is proven to be true it'll be beneficial for you, too, *that evening while John is scraping red paint off his shoes over an old newspaper.*
John: Oh don't even try to pretend you're doing this for my sake like some kind-hearted benefactor.
Sherlock: “It’s for science, John,”
John: “Fine. Your bedroom, not mine, fourteen nights, anything weird happens and I’m out.”
Sherlock: “Weird how?”
John: “Just weird, Sherlock.”
Sherlock: *sits in his chair looking unbelievably pleased with himself.*
John: *hopes he can keep himself from smothering him with a pillow before the experiment is finished.*"
2,"346797,",John,Sherlock,"John: I want to talk to you, *shoves him back, or fakes it. Either way John figures he has every right to be incredibly annoyed and contemplates smothering Sherlock with a pillow.*
Sherlock: *answers questions in his sleep* It might be one of the more delightfully entertaining nights of his life. He’s so incredibly amused he even takes getting accidentally swatted in the face by Sherlock’s hand in stride.
John: I can't believe he's been sharing a bed with Sherlock for an entire fucking week. He also has to grudgingly admit he's been sleeping like a baby for a few nights now. Sherlock has finally adapted to sharing his bed and has stopped flailing about like a starfish having a seizure quite so much, and even if he does still have the most fascinating stories to tell every night John starts sleeping through them without a problem. Sherlock asks him whether he feels well rested and he concludes that, yes, he does (which leads to more furious scribbling in the Moleskine for science). He might assume the same for Sherlock - absolutely fascinating, since he didn't think he'd seen the man sleep a completely mundane eight hours a night even once, let alone seven nights in a row. He'd liked to be able to say it made a difference for Sherlock, being properly rested, but it honestly didn't. On the up side Sherlock could no longer claim that sleeping regularly slowed his brain down. Now if John could only figure out a way to get him to do the same for eating like a normal human being he might just consider this whole experiment as smashing success.
Sherlock: It doesn't, *answers absently, words on his screen reflected in his eyes.*
John: It must. You're sleeping like a baby every night.
Sherlock: Yes I am. For the experiment, not because I need it.
John: Right. That's. Wait a minute. Are you telling me you're making yourself sleep, to meet the parameters stated for your experiment? Despite not being actually tired?
Sherlock: Yes, *answers slowly, like he's talking to a mentally deficit four year old.*
John: That's physically impossible.
Sherlock: *turns his laptop off with a few quick clicks and swishes across the touchpad and looks at John as the screen goes black.* I am in control of my own body. I want the results of this experiment to be as accurate as possible, so I am making myself sleep eight hours a night like proposed.
John: I hate you, *states flatly, turns over and wishes himself to sleep.*
Sherlock: *tells a shockingly coherent sleep-story about a cow in Trafalgar square.*
John: How long are we going to keep doing this again?
Sherlock: Fourteen nights, at minimum. More if the outcome isn't quite clear yet.
John: Does it look like it will be clear?
Sherlock: Ask me again in two nights.
Sherlock: *asks for his mother and then for Mycroft in a way that suggests to John he's flashing back to his childhood.*"
3,"346797,",John,Sherlock,"John: It's the weather, what are you going to do? Your marvellous control over your body not allowing you to sleep through a little storm?
Sherlock: Shut up. I don't see you sleeping, either.
John: I'm usually fine sleeping through storms, but not those that decide to camp out on my roof.
Sherlock: I may have to forego on counting this night in terms of rest and comfort. But this night is still relevant to the final conclusion I may draw. Laying awake through a storm is much nicer when you've got company.
John: You've never had someone in your bed during a storm?
Sherlock: Nope.
John: You've never had anyone in your bed at all, have you?
Sherlock: Nope.
John: Have you ever been in anyone else's bed, then?
Sherlock: This is a very roundabout way of inquiring after my sexual experience, John.
John: All right. Cards on the table. Are you a virgin?
Sherlock: Technically speaking, yes. Is this surprising?
John: Not surprising. I'd suspected... I mean, it's you. I can't even imagine... not that I sit around imagining... well. It's just, generally speaking, a bit of an odd idea. For someone your age. Have you really never wanted to?
Sherlock: I've been curious, but never enough to do something about it. It seems like such a hassle. I can assure you my theoretical knowledge on the subject is quite comprehensive.
John: I figured as much. It just seems odd that you're not willing to accept someone else's data when it comes to sleeping patterns, but you're fine with accepting second-hand information about sex.
Sherlock: *giving him an oddly slack-jawed look*"
4,"346797,",Sherlock,John,"Sherlock: Never mind, he backtracks. You're more than free to just... do what you want. Or not do. Whatever you want. I'm glad you've shared this with me though. Not to sound too weird, but I have been wondering.
John: You could've just come out and asked me before, John. It's not something I'm self-conscious about.
Sherlock: Yeah. That's. Yeah. All right. John rolls onto his back again, sheets pulled up awkwardly to his chin. The thunder drifts away, slowly, while John closes his eyes and tries to catch the coattails of sleep. He can feel Sherlock still watching him and tries not to think about it.

John: Are you all right?
Sherlock: Yes. Fine. He turns on his side and clutches at his pillow with one hand, squeezing his eyes shut.
Sherlock: “John. Do I... do you need me to do something for you?”
John: “I’m fine Sherlock. Go back to sleep,” he says tonelessly, and feels the mattress dip and shift as Sherlock settles himself back.

John: Just before falling asleep John realises Sherlock’s study ought to be ending in three days and doesn’t know how to feel about that. Then he doesn’t know what to feel about not knowing what to feel, and Sherlock is sleep-babbling away next to him about a goose in Kent and John is caught on that bewildering precipice of being unable to decide whether he should be laughing or crying about an absurd situation.

John: The night before their last they hardly sleep at all. A case pops up that ends with the two of them chasing down a skinny boy on a skateboard and turning him in for the murder of a 17 year old girl that had been written off several months earlier as a suicide. They eventually fall into bed well past five am, John not even bothering to change his clothes.
Sherlock: Sherlock still wakes him up at eight, disturbingly well-rested for a man who hasn’t gotten more than three hours of sleep, and starts cheerfully relaying to John how he apparently snores when asleep in his day clothes and isn’t it fascinating how they both fell asleep so quickly even though adrenaline still pumped through their veins when they came home?"
5,"346797,",Sherlock,John,"Sherlock: John once again contemplates smothering him with a pillow.
John: Their last night is extraordinarily dull and plain. Sherlock sits and yells at the television before they head off to bed, they say good night, and fall asleep.
Sherlock: John sleeps through the entire night, not waking once, not even when Sherlock talks about him in his sleep (the only time he’s done that in the past thirty nights, and the only time John misses it). They both wake up around ten minutes before the alarm goes off and John is already brushing his teeth in the bathroom when the thing starts beeping and Sherlock’s well-aimed fist quiets it.
John: He finds the report on the kitchen table when he comes home from the surgery that evening. 'Are these your results?' he calls into the living room, where a non-committal grunt from Sherlock constitutes a ‘yes’.
John: Can I read it?
Sherlock: Knock yourself out. Sherlock walks past the open door, looping his scarf around his neck.
John: Where are you going?
Sherlock: Out. Morgue. Molly’s got someone in who died from falling off his roof onto his gardening shed. She reckons I might want to see.
John: It tickles him that Sherlock refers to him so officially in a report that, for all intents and purposes, will never be seen by anyone other than Sherlock and himself. John doesn’t read the whole thing, glossing over the unexpectedly colourful graphs and most of the tables with numbers that he half expects are just there to look fancy and have no real meaning at all. It does turn out, however, that Sherlock wrote down brief descriptions of every night spent together. Most of them are absolutely dull, detailing only the hours he’d slept and whether it made him function better the day after, but a couple jump out at him, unexpectedly personal slices of Sherlock’s perspective.
Sherlock: Fell asleep at roughly 0:15. Both me and J. slept quite undisturbed, most probably due to strenuous activity during the day. J. very quiet sleeper. Checked on his breathing four times during the night, wondering if he’d perhaps died on me.
Sherlock: Fell asleep at roughly 11:55. J.’s preferred position for sleeping is curled up in the foetal position on his left side (back to me). When sleeping lightly he lies on his back, one arm over his head. My preferred position for sleeping is on my belly with right leg pulled up. Do not know what position I lie in when sleeping lightly. Should perhaps ask J. More often than not now he sleeps in the foetal position, suggesting he does indeed enter a deeper, more rewarding sleep when presented with a bedfellow.
Sherlock: Fell asleep at roughly 0:06. Purchased a camera during the day to film J.’s sleeping. Fascinated by his utter silence paired with the REM clearly visible as he enters deep sleep. Have started clocking how long he remains in the REM cycle, but find myself falling asleep while counting which is far too counterproductive for my liking. Should perhaps leave the camera running all night, as to collect data later.
Sherlock: Fell asleep at roughly 11:58. Bad dream during night. J. doesn’t seem to have noticed. Interesting to note bad dreams still occur with calming presence of a friend nearby.
Sherlock: Fell asleep at roughly 0:35. Slept v. well. So did J. Results still inconclusive. Proposed the study be bumped up to 30 days rather than 14. J. agreed, surprisingly. Feeling v. rested and oddly at..."
6,"346797,",John,J.,"John: Fell asleep at roughly 11:58. Bad dream during night. J. doesn’t seem to have noticed. Interesting to note bad dreams still occur with calming presence of a friend nearby.
John: Fell asleep at roughly 0:35. Slept v. well. So did J. Results still inconclusive. Proposed the study be bumped up to 30 days rather than 14. J. agreed, surprisingly. Feeling v. rested and oddly at peace with the world. Not sure I like it.
John: Fell asleep at roughly 0:05. Slept v. well. So did J. J. does not agree to being filmed. Pity, as his movements and facial expressions during sleep are still incredibly useful. Still allowed me to keep and use the footage I already have, so at least that’s something.
John: Due to thunderstorm results on sleep for this night are not utilizable. Have however learned that braving a storm helps develop a strange sense of kinship between people. J. felt inclined to discuss some personal topics. Felt v. comfortable with this. Fascinating.
John: It is, however, the entry for the 22nd night which really stumps John. It is empty. It says, right there, Day 22, but has nothing on it. No data, no observations, no nothing, a full blank page right in the middle of the thick report. John digs in his memory and stutters to an astonished halt when he realises that was the night of his nightmare. He stares at the empty entry and realises Sherlock must have kept it that way just for his sake, not wanting to comment on his frazzled state any more than wishing to fill the entry up with cold data like it hadn’t happened at all, and John is hit with a wave of raw gratitude so great it nearly drowns him.
John: He puts the report back on the kitchen table and sits on the sofa with a book that fails to hold his attention, waiting for Sherlock to come home. When he does it is with intensely disturbing if enthusiastically told stories about livers with gardening utensils stuck through them but John smiles and listens attentively.
John: Night -1. John sleeps like shit and listens to Sherlock rummaging around on the floor below the entire night.
John: Night -3. John sleeps like shit. Sherlock starts playing the violin at precisely 3:42 am. John contemplates smothering him with a pillow, but that seems much more difficult to accomplish with him down in the living room and John up in his own bed.
John: Night -7. John hasn’t slept well in almost a week and Sherlock has barely slept at all, he reckons, save for the one morning where he came downstairs to find him slumped across his desk with not one but two yellow post-its stuck to his forehead, and John can only stretch so far until he snaps.
John: It is nearly a quarter to twelve when John switches off the television right in the middle of the show he’d been watching and stands up. “Let’s go to sleep,” he states, just a bit too loudly for it to still sound sort of casual.
Sherlock: Sherlock stares at him, sitting at the desk behind his laptop, quite blank until he catches up delightfully quick. He smirks, a corner of his mouth curling up while his fingers perform the tell-tale dance of switching his laptop off.
John: John changes into his pyjamas and brushes his teeth. Sherlock is already in bed when he pads into the bedroom, curled up on his side, just a dark mop of curls peeking out from underneath white sheets. John switches off the lights and gets into bed.
Sherlock: He is lulled to sleep by a most disjointed story Sherlock sleep-tells him about bees that comes out half French, half English. He sleeps like a baby."
