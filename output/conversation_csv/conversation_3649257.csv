0,3649257,Waver,Gilgamesh,"Waver: Oh, he said. You've grown. I suppose that happens.
Gilgamesh: These are your posted office hours, he said.
Waver: Yes, said Waver, for lack of any other response; -- They are.
Gilgamesh: Am I speaking to Lord El-Melloi the Second?
Waver: You are, said Waver.
Gilgamesh: Retainer to Alexander the Third of Macedonia?
Waver: Yes, he said at last.
Gilgamesh: Then, he said, I require the hospitality of Iskandar the King of Conquerors.
Waver: Yes. On behalf of my lord Iskandar the King of Conquerors, I offer you his hospitality.
Gilgamesh: Very well. Where do you live?
Waver: S-South Kensington, he said.
Gilgamesh: Why? So I can admire your city's rat population?
Waver: We could also not take the tube, said Waver in a voice ironed into absolute evenness by years of dealing with students. I don't suppose the King of Heroes would condescend to step into a taxi?
Waver: Nothing that would suit you, said Waver--then, grudgingly, my lord.
Gilgamesh: Do not, said Gilgamesh with a snort. I loathe pretenses."
1,3649257,Waver,Gilgamesh,"Waver: Don't you have anything to drink?
Gilgamesh: Nothing that would suit you.
Waver: One thing I remember liking about you was that you didn't have any. I wouldn't like that to have changed.
Gilgamesh: Impertinent child.
Waver: I'm sorry to disappoint you, my lord.
Gilgamesh: Get me a drink.
Waver: Why me?
Gilgamesh: Do you have another key? I'll be coming and going as I please. You may as well give me a key.
Waver: Why me?
Gilgamesh: Are we going to play a riddle-game about what I'm doing here? Is that what's going to happen?
Waver: I'd rather not. Begging your pardon, my lord, I've very little patience for games with my friends. I have no reason to consider you one.
Gilgamesh: Because I've slain your king?
Waver: No. I thought we'd settled that particular account. Because we barely know one another. I'll ask you again: why me?
Gilgamesh: I don't know anyone else in London, and I require a place to stay."
2,3649257,Waver Velvet,Gilgamesh,"Waver Velvet: All right, I'll get you the other key. *Gilgamesh didn't react to his awkwardness; Gilgamesh didn't even seem to notice, if he was listening at all. He had his feet stretched out on the arm of the sofa and was staring at the wall: or the door, perhaps.*
Gilgamesh: --My head aches. I'm hungry.
Waver Velvet: Probably from sleeping so much. You could've gone out.
Gilgamesh: Certainly not. I'm exhausted. It's-- It's some defect of your dreary little country. No wonder no one's heard of it.
Waver Velvet: Well, you're in luck. I've got food. There's nothing especially tiring about Great Britain, Gilgamesh. You can acquire food outside anytime you like--though God knows how you're going to pay for it.
Gilgamesh: I have a card.
Waver Velvet: Then wake up earlier tomorrow.
Gilgamesh: I can't. Not in this hideous country.
Waver Velvet: Are you jet-lagged?
Gilgamesh: *looked suspicious and then, after a pause, nodded*
Waver Velvet: Did you get on an aeroplane to get here? From somewhere else far away? ... Were you on an aeroplane?
Gilgamesh: *looked suspicious and then, after a pause, nodded*
Waver Velvet: *ran his hand back through his hair and considered how to explain the concept of time zones to a prehistoric Sumerian, but was distracted by the spark of interest he felt: he knew something now. Maybe it brought up more questions than it answered, but--for whatever reason, Gilgamesh had been alive long enough to take an aeroplane to London. One way or another, he hadn't been summoned here. He'd come. But that didn't make any sense.*
Gilgamesh: Do you have a television?
Waver Velvet: That's a television?
Gilgamesh: It's so small."
3,3649257,Gilgamesh,Waver,"Gilgamesh: Do you have a television?
Waver: That's a television?
Gilgamesh: It's so small.
Waver: Yes, well, I am what is referred to as an 'adjunct.' You're free to get your own.
Gilgamesh: You'd better not have stolen that.
Waver: It would be categorically impossible for me to steal it.
Gilgamesh: I have a card.
Waver: Why 'Hannah'?
Gilgamesh: It's the same forwards and backwards.
Waver: What are you doing up?
Gilgamesh: What time is it in Japan?
Waver: Noon.
Waver: Is there someone out there I should be worried about, Gilgamesh?
Gilgamesh: No. That's not the way that he is.
Gilgamesh: You know who I am."
4,3649257,Waver,Gilgamesh,"Waver: Yes, *looked heavenward in lieu of elaborating.*
Gilgamesh: You know who I am, *watched milk splash with a faint, childish fascination.*
Waver: I've had ten years, *set breakfast down in front of Gilgamesh first* to know who you are, King of Heroes.
Gilgamesh: Is it so easy?
Waver: I've had every spare moment of my life since then to make sense of the War, *swallowed down a deep breath* There is only one way I know how to make sense of things, my lord. I read. Your name is one of the first ever to be committed to letters. You're more than legend--you are the fabric of how we understand what legend is. I don't say that to flatter. *Gilgamesh laughed, short, devoid of malice or compassion either.* Of course I would come to know my king's killer. Of course I would recognize you.
Gilgamesh: More than legend. And yet you remember me as your king's killer. Is that right?
Waver: *glanced away* Yes.
Gilgamesh: Love is a magnificent thing, Waver Velvet. It makes even your small self large. *didn't sound happy when he said it* You've still nothing to drink here, boy. I expect that to change sometime today.
Waver: This is alcoholic.
Gilgamesh: Many things 'are alcoholic.'
Waver: This is alcoholic, *twist of a smile* and what's more, it's something to drink. Enjoy, my lord."
5,3649257,Waver,Gilgamesh,"Waver: This is alcoholic.
Gilgamesh: Many things 'are alcoholic.'
Waver: This is alcoholic, and what's more, it's something to drink. Enjoy, my lord.
Gilgamesh: I want to go out. Let's go out somewhere.
Waver: Did you have somewhere in mind?
Gilgamesh: This music. You've no quarrel from me.
Waver: It's not I who chose the venue.
Gilgamesh: Waitress! I'd like to order a bottle for us both. Something to shove a spine into the boy's back, would you...? --Yes, I'll open up a tab.
Waver: Gilgamesh. Hey. I mean, my lord. Gilgamesh.
Gilgamesh: Yes?
Waver: Are you trying to see when he'll cut off your card?
Gilgamesh: You're drunk already.
Waver: Am I.
Gilgamesh: You're no use to me drunk. You aren't much of a protector sober and you're less of one inebriated.
Waver: Now I'm supposed to be your protector too? I put you up in my flat, I clean up your messes, I share my space with you--I am your host, Gilgamesh. But I can't imagine how I could presume to protect the likes of you. You may as well ask me for prana. You'll get about the same.
Gilgamesh: You don't have any prana.
Waver: Yes. That was the comparison."
6,3649257,Gilgamesh,Waver,"Gilgamesh: If you were my Master, then you and I would be the lioness and the lion. The lioness hunts and provides for the male, and protects the territory from all the lesser things. The lioness is fierce. The lioness is industrious. But when another lion comes, or something worse--ah, well. Then that's the lion's affair.
Waver: Rather an arrangement that favors the lion, I should think.
Gilgamesh: Well, of course.

Gilgamesh: You're sitting in my bed.
Waver: You weren't occupying it.
Gilgamesh: *walks over and plops himself down on the other half of the couch*

Waver: I was thinking about something.
Gilgamesh: You're often thinking about something. There's always something bouncing around in your little head. Do you find it tiring? Does it really afford you any more control over the world around you than you already had?
Waver: *ignores the questions* I'm not wool-gathering, King of Heroes. I was thinking about the War.
Gilgamesh: And did it afford you peace?
Waver: No.

Waver: I was thinking-- I was thinking it was a lie. A sort of blood sacrifice to some other power.
Gilgamesh: Yes.
Waver: 'Yes?'
Gilgamesh: Yes. That's what it is.

Waver: *says nothing more*
Gilgamesh: *casts several curious glances in Waver's direction*"
7,3649257,Waver,Gilgamesh,"Waver: That wouldn't have been good enough for him.
Gilgamesh: Don't chase another Grail War. Not for him. Not for yourself. But not for him, child. It's a game for children and fools and he's neither.
Waver: That would be difficult. I'll be rather old by the next time.
Gilgamesh: You should destroy Iskandar's artifact. Destroy it and break these shackles that come again and again.
Waver: And you? What of yours?
Gilgamesh: Never mind mine."
