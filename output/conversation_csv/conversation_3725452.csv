0,3725452,Seamus,Dean,"Seamus: Disgusting, aren't they?
Dean: You can say that again. *munching on Seamus's stolen toast*
Harry: What happened there, anyway?
Dean: He saw his thoughts on her elbow, *munching on Seamus's stolen toast* and tried to tell her he'd fancied her for ages, tripped over his own feet, and complimented her fingernails.
Seamus: Apparently, *smirking* not that you need the advice, eh, Potter?
Harry: *rolling his eyes* Still insults, remember?
Seamus: Good for you! *clapping Harry on the back*
Dean: *watching Harry*
Seamus: *smiling at Dean*
Dean: *grinning back at Seamus*
Seamus: *leaning back in his seat, trying to catch a glimpse of his calf*
Seamus: *leaning forward, stabbing his fork into his sausages with unnecessary vigor*"
1,3725452,Seamus,Dean,"Seamus: Oi, Finnigan, what’d the sausages ever do to you?
Ron: What're you smilin' about then?
Seamus: Nostalgia. Remember charms first year?
Dean: You lit that feather on fire.
Seamus: Accidentally!
Dean: Oh, so the next hundred fireballs weren't an accident, then?
Seamus: *protested, nudging him*
Dean: *nudged him back, laughing*
Seamus: *stuck his tongue out at him*"

Dean: *barely flinched*
Seamus: *realized how close they were* Seamus...
Professor Flitwick: Ok! Now you all try! Go on and give it a go!
Seamus: *glanced at Dean*
Dean: I'll go first then? *smirked*
Seamus: *half-grinned back*
Dean: Obscuro! *gave his wand a tiny flick*
Seamus: *yelped in surprise* Teach you not to pay attention, mate.
Dean: *chuckled* Here."
3,3725452,Dean,Seamus,"Dean: Here, let me... *Dean's voice, strangely hoarse, came far closer than Seamus thought it was, bare centimeters from his ear*
Seamus: Hi there.
Dean: Your turn. *putting down his wand*
Seamus: Just a little flick, then?
Dean: No, no, no. Like this. *Dean twisted Seamus's wrist for him, a bit sharper than he had been*
Seamus: Blimey - not about my freckles for once.
Dean: Yeah, well, that's what it's usually on about."
