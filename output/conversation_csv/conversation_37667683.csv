0,37667683,Peter,Mr Harrington,"Peter: But, sir, *Peter shook his head defiantly*, You know the rules, Peter, *Mr Harrington nodded at the noise*, so, with deep regret and embarrassment, Peter pulled out his phone. It was Tony. Peter winced, looked up at Mr Harrington with another pleading glance. Mr Harrington just made a gesture towards the phone and raised his eyebrow further, somehow. Peter winced and said, Karen, can you answer it and put it on speaker, please? He decided not to think about the fact that he was asking his phone's AI to answer the phone, and that, to most people, that would be considered weird.
Tony: Hey, kid, came the voice of everyone's favourite billionaire.
Peter: Hi, Mr Stark! You're, um--
Tony: As I was saying, I was wondering if you still had the specs to the energy deal with Pym Tech? Peter closed his eyes in horror. This was his worst nightmare. I know it's not really your focus right now because of the whole thing with Colonel Williamson and the military being complete assholes but--
Peter: Mr Stark! Peter interrupted quickly, covering his face with one hand in frustration, and the whole class stared at him like he was completely mental."
1,37667683,Peter,Mr. Harrington,"Peter: You're on speaker, *interrupted quickly, covering his face with one hand in frustration*
Mr. Harrington: *flabbergasted* And who, may I ask, just heard all of that?
Peter: The whole of my calculus class, *grimaced* And my teacher.
Tony: Would that be the calculus teacher who teaches the easiest derivatives to date?
Peter: *mouth dropped open in surprise*
Mr. Harrington: *stunned* Um...
Tony: Peter, do me a favour and pass me over to Mr Harrington, please.
Peter: *grabbed onto the phone tightly*
Tony: *coughed a little in encouragement*
Peter: *passed over the phone with his heart pounding in its chest*
Tony: Hello, Roger. *emphasized*"
2,37667683,Tony,Peter,"Tony: Hello, Roger. *emphasised*
Peter: *feeling embarrassed* Oh god.
Tony: *stalked Mr Harrington online* Do me a favour, and take me off speaker.
Peter: *calling for Karen* Karen, turn it off speaker please.
Mr Harrington: *nodding and looking scared* Okay, sir.
Tony: *asking to be put back on speaker* Karen, speaker.
Peter: Pete, we'll catch up later. It's lab day, yeah?
Peter: *exhausted* Yeah. See ya.
Classmate: Did that just...happen?
Another classmate: Well, he did say he had an internship.
Mr Harrington: *blankly staring at the back of the room* Well, class, let's get back to talking about derivatives."
3,37667683,Peter,Karen,"Peter: Karen, please answer it and put it on speaker, *grimaces* Hi, you're on speaker.
Pepper: Calculus again? *sympathetic*
Peter: Yup, Calculus. *glances around the class and ignores the stares he was getting*
Pepper: Ah. May I speak to your teacher? *Peter shoots a look at Mr Harrington*"
4,37667683,Peter,Pepper,"Peter: Yup, Calculus.
Peter: Ah. May I speak to your teacher?
Peter: Ah— Pepper, I don’t think that would be the best idea.
Peter: What is it you want to say?
Pepper: I wanted to apologise for my husband, mainly, for his little speech.
Pepper: But well, also, make sure that Mr Harrington has been keeping his promises. Tony told me to ask, if I was ever put on speaker.
Mr Harrington: Yes—um, yes,
Peter: He says he has been, but Pepper—
Pepper: I’ll tell Tony. No need for him to pay an in-person visit, then.
Peter: Definitely no need!
Peter: May I ask why you are indeed calling?
Pepper: Stark Industries emergency,
Pepper: We’re working on the Jacobs lawsuit, it goes to court this afternoon, and I was wondering whether you had the Jacobs’ file and also if you knew what Mr Hasleton’s email was? I couldn’t find it on the system.
Peter: And…checking up on my Calculus teacher takes priority over that?
Pepper: Tony was very strict in his instruction, Peter,
Mr Harrington: *having trouble breathing*"
5,37667683,Tony,Peter,"Pepper: Tony was very strict in his instruction, Peter, *said sternly*
Peter: *shook his head without saying anything*
Pepper: You're a life-saver, Pete, *said with a sigh of relief*
Peter: Agreed, *muttered*
Pepper: Oh, and also, the military sent word that they are sending in a spokesperson later to talk to you.
Peter: Don't they know it's supposed to be my day off today? *shook his head, tone of complaint strong in his voice* Did they say who it was going to be?
Pepper: You're not going to be happy.
Peter: *groaned* Don't tell me it's—
Pepper: I'm sorry, it is Colonel Williamson, *had just ruined his day*
Peter: *sighed* I'll have to deal with that later, I guess.
Pepper: Sorry for calling you at school, Pete, *apologized*
Peter: *shrugged*"
6,37667683,Peter,Pepper,"Peter: Iâ€™ll have to deal with that later, I guess.
Pepper: Sorry for calling you at school, Pete.
Peter: Itâ€™s okay. Theyâ€™ve all signed NDAs, right?
Pepper: They have.
Peter: Great. No problem here then. Iâ€™ll see you later, best of luck with the Jacobs case.
Pepper: Bye, Peter.
Peter: *His calculus class just stared in shocked silence, because they believed now, of course, that Peter was Tonyâ€™s intern* Iâ€™m not a fucking zoo exhibit, stop with the staring!"
7,37667683,Peter,Happy,"Peter: I'm not a fucking zoo exhibit, stop with the staring!
Peter: Yeah, yeah. I know, *in a bored tone* Karen, be a dear and put it on speaker for us.
Peter: You need me?
Happy: Yes, didn't FRIDAY text you?
Happy: It's the YoungBoss protocol, get here, stat.
Peter: Happy - I'm in class, *hissed*"
8,37667683,Peter,Happy,"Peter: Happy — I'm in class. Where's Tony, or Pepper?
Happy: Busy. Please, Colonel Williamson is here again and you know how he is, demanding a meeting with you?
Peter: He swore he wouldn't show his face for the next three months.
Peter: Hurry up. I'm outside, where are you. We need you, Boss.
Happy: Wait, kid, am I on speaker?
Peter: Uh...maybe?
Happy: This whole time?
Peter: Um...yup."
9,37667683,Peter,Happy,"Peter: Uh...maybe? *Peter admitted, a frown on his face.*
Happy: This whole time? *Happy asked incredulously.*
Peter: Um...yup. *Peter admitted, a frown on his face.*
Flash: *Flash's face was contorting through various emotions, a circle of anger, confusion, and upset as he tried to figure out just what was going on with Peter Parker this time.*
Peter: *Peter could just tell Happy was shaking his head in the car, exasperated.* Oh my god, kid, we're going to have words later.
Peter: See you in a second, Happy. I'll be a minute.
Peter: *Peter was more than happy to fill in the shoes of the CEO.* After dealing with Williamson, who he'd basically just told off with some carefully chosen words, he enquired into why he was acting as CEO.
Peter: *Peter was the Boss, he made the rules.* And if staying at the Tower all day meant that he could watch a Star Wars re-run when it was on TV, then hey. He was the Boss, he made the rules.
Steve: *mr america is here and he has things to say.*"
10,37667683,Peter,Karen,"Peter: Karen, you know the drill, *heart racing just fast enough to give him some adrenaline, but not fast enough that it would alert Tony to his enhanced vitals and prompt him to take a trip down to Midtown. Peter had a bad feeling about this call...*
Steve: Hi, Peter, *Captain America addressed Peter, and Peter had actually never wanted to melt into a pool of sludge more. Great, now the whole class knew that he was on first time basis with the Avengers. That was just perfect.*
Kid: You've got to be fucking kidding me, *one kid whispered, at the back. Peter hoped the phone hadn't picked it up, because Steve was like a magnet for bad language, and he had no interest in Steve doing a PSA live on the call.*
Peter: Steve, *he said, wincing as he did so. If he tried to call Steve by his surname, then Steve would probably call him out on it. He'd tried to call him Captain Rogers when they'd first met and in some interactions post that, but after Peter had seen the man wrapped in a towel whilst staying the night at the Tower, he'd demanded that Peter called him Steve. It was just weird. You're on speaker.*
Steve: Oh? *Steve seemed amused, but still oblivious to the true nature of the situation. Is Ned there?*
Ned: Oh my god, *Ned whispered, staring up at Peter alongside the rest of the class. Well, actually, a good portion of the class had now turned to Ned with shocked stares, so it was 50/50 between them. Nice not to have the whole class' attention on him. Captain America just said my name.*
Peter: Yes, Ned is here, but— *Seriously, would none of these people ever let him finish his sentences?! Jeez.*
Steve: Hello, Ned, *Steve interrupted cheerily. I hope your Death Star project is coming along well.*
Ned: T-thank you, Sir."
11,37667683,Steve,Peter,"Steve: T-thank you, Sir.
Peter: Steve, you're on speaker to my whole class. You know, like what Tony was talking about the other day!
Steve: Hello, Peter's class. And Mr Harrington.
Peter: Steve. Why are you calling me?
Steve: Well, Bucky and I were having this debate.
Peter: Definitely the first one.
Steve: Damn, that was Bucky's idea. I should have known you'd agree with him.
Peter: Well. He is the coolest.
Steve: Next prank, Bucky and I are going to be coming for you two, hard."
12,37667683,Peter,Tony,"Peter: Nice try. Tony and I have something up our sleeve.
Steve: I still think it's unfair that you get to team up with the guy who literally owns and made the building.
Peter: Tony's a regular guy! You're a super soldier. I think it's fair enough that we play on home territory.
Steve: Regular guy, you say! The man is half coffee, half trauma! He's practically got superpowers from that!
Peter: Okay, true, you make some good points. But anyways, you should go for the vent idea. That's hilarious. Film it.
Peter: Steve?
Peter: Please just text me next time."
13,37667683,Peter Parker,President Ellis,"Peter: Karen, if you could please do the honours?
President Ellis: Peter Parker, Good morning.
Peter: Hello, um, Mr President.
Peter: Okay, so, maybe Peter was in regular communication with the President of the United States. It was no big deal. The class would be totally normal about that, he was completely sure.
Peter: So, yes, he knew the President. Decently well, actually. Enough to know that his favourite breakfast food was waffles with a very specific kind of maple syrup they imported from Canada.
Peter: He just had to own it, so he made it loud and clear for the people sitting at the back."
14,37667683,Peter,President Ellis,"Peter: Hi, Peter. How are you doing?
President Ellis: I am very well, thank you, Pete.
Peter: And you?
President Ellis: Well, I wanted to talk to you about your trip up here.
Peter: Oh, right. It's in like three weeks right?
President Ellis: Yes, my staff were going to call you to ask some questions and then I was like, no, I'll do it. I have his number.
Peter: Um, what do you need to know?
President Ellis: What are your favourite foods? How many pillows do you like on your bed? Whether you need a dressing gown? Do you need parking space? Stuff like that. If we could have a quick chat, just to run through the list, that would be great.
Peter: Oh, um, sure.
President Ellis: Oh, also, we're having this military conference with pretty important people staying with us, I know you work with the military sometimes, so is there anything I should know about that?
Peter: Um, well. I guess, um, Colonel Williamson and I don't get on very well?
President Ellis: That's okay, we'll just tell him he can..."
15,37667683,Colonel Williamson,President Ellis,"Peter: I guess, um, Colonel Williamson and I donâ€™t get on very well?
President Ellis: Thatâ€™s okay, weâ€™ll just tell him he canâ€™t come.
Peter: No, no, Iâ€™m sure that wonâ€™t be necessary.
President Ellis: No, trust me, itâ€™s for the best. I told Tony Iâ€™d do everything I could to make you comfortable. Anything for Tony Starkâ€™sâ€”
Peter: Itâ€™s honestly okay, he can come, I donâ€™t mind.
President Ellis: Peter, really, youâ€™re the guest. So, what do you think. Breakfast food? Dressing gown?
Peter: Iâ€™m really, really sorry about this, but Iâ€™m kind of in a class right now, so is it okay if I call you back?
President Ellis: Oh, of course, thatâ€™s no problem. Call back whenever.
Peter: Thank you, um, Mr President.
President Ellis: Iâ€™ve told you before, Pete, you can call me Matthew, I donâ€™t mind. Anything for Tony Starkâ€™sâ€”
Peter: Bye, Mr President!

Mr Harrington: Parker, what the fuck?"
16,37667683,Mr. Harrington,Peter,"Mr. Harrington: Parker, what the fuck? *lost his cool*
Peter: *puts a hand over his (reddened) face*
Mr. Harrington: *decided to end the policy of answering phones on speaker*
Peter: *breathed a sigh of relief*
Mr. Harrington: *made the best decision ever*
Peter: *had a very relaxing week*
Peter: *sat in Calculus wondering whether he'd have to answer his phone on speaker*
Peter: *didn't have to worry when he pulled out his phone in class*"
17,37667683,Flash,Peter,"Flash: Penis Parker!
Peter: What do you want, Flash?
Flash: Get up, *shoving Peter's chair*
Peter: Why should I?
Flash: Get up, *pushing the chair*
Peter: Right, seriously, that's just stupid.
Flash: It worked, didn't it?
Peter: Your phone is vibrating.
Flash: Who is it?
Peter: You don't need to know.
Flash: Tell me. And answer it, on speaker. Right now. Or... I'll hit you.
Peter: Fine, hit me. I don't care."
18,37667683,Peter,Flash,"Peter: Fine, hit me. I don't care. *Lots of his classmates were looking at him like he was crazy. Maybe he was. He could take it, a punch from Flash wasn't that hard. He'd fought Black Widow before in a training ring, and had been smashed to the ground enough times to be able to take a basic punch.*
Flash: *scoffed, and walked away from him, walking towards Ned. He grabbed Ned's hoodie, holding the boy up by it and Peter stepped forwards, wanting to protect his friend instinctively.* If you don't answer your phone on speaker right now, I will hit this loser. So do it.
Ned: Don't do it, *interjected, and shook his head at Peter, closing his eyes. I can take it.*
Peter: *frowned.* There were 1000 ways to handle this conversation, and any of them were probably better than what he was about to do. But he had to handle it quickly, and he didn't want Flash to hit Ned (who definitely didn't know how to handle a punch). *So he pulled out his phone and said, I'll do it. Flash let go of Ned's hoodie and Ned collapsed back into his seat, wide-eyed and still shaking his head at Peter.*
Mr. Harrington: *assessed the situation, glancing at Peter who was still backed into the wall, Flash standing next to Ned and frowned.* What is going on here? Parker--
Peter: *jolted himself out of the shock and smiled like he always did when he had to do business, the kind of fake smile you saw every day in an office when someone was really internally crying.* Oh, hi! Hello, Your Majesty, um, what questions do you have?
Abe: *whispered, voice high-pitched and unstable as though he was in shock,* Is that the Queen?
Peter: *smiled like he always did when he had to do business, the kind of fake smile you saw every day in an office when someone was really internally crying.* Oh, hi! Hello, Your Majesty, um, what questions do you have?"
19,37667683,Peter,The Queen,"Peter: Well, how's about I send someone over to correct the planning permission, get all of this fixed promptly? We have some people at the London SI office I can send over right away.
The Queen: Oh, no, Peter, my darling, I would only trust you with something so important as this. Think of the bees.
Peter: Of course. I can probably be over by tomorrow at nine if you would like?
The Queen: Good heavens, Whatever was that noise?
Peter: Oh, sorry, ma'am, It's fairly busy here.
The Queen: Oh, no bother. And yes, Peter, that would be perfect. I'll see you tomorrow, and make sure to get you some of those gummy worms stocked. I'll tell my butler this instant to prepare you your room at Buck Pal, I'll be there.
Peter: Great, I'll see you tomorrow, Lizzie—um, Ma'am.
The Queen: Goodbye, Peter, The Queen said cheerily, and hung up on him."
