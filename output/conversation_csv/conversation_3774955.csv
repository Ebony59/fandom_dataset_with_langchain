0,3774955,Saber,Tohsaka,"Saber: Eh? *considers the jewel* Tohsaka—but your money, you don’t need to—
Rin: As your master, it’s only proper to provide my student with a bit of insurance. *crosses her arms and tilts up her chin*
Saber: *clasps her hands together* Take it, Shirou. I won’t hear a refusal from you.
Shirou: I wasn’t going to say no. *wisely* Thanks, Tohsaka. I definitely won’t lose it.
Rin: I expect that I won’t have to come back and grow a heart again for you if you get into trouble. You’d better think of yourself! Or think of Sakura! I don’t care if Matou Shinji’s out of the hospital now; he’s still a miserable little bug and needs to be driven off.
Shirou: Shinji’s never come by to tell Sakura she needs to move back.
Rin: Yet. While I’m not here, you’d better keep it that way. *snaps* When does archery practice finish again?

Rin: Waver Velvet. I did tell you before, right? *flopped on top of her suitcase* Master of Rider in the Fourth War—he’s at the Clock Tower, one of the Lords now, and he said he’d sponsor me. We won’t be living in the dorms and there’s no way he’d bother leaving his office to find me, but I bet he’d know you even after all these years.
Saber: He always saw me in armor, and it’s been more than a decade. In everyday clothing I would draw little attention.
Rin: *sighs* Are you joking? *eyes Saber from head to toe*
Saber: Even Ryuudou thinks you’re fine, and he..."
1,3774955,Saber,Rin,"Saber: That fake priest! I can do without seeing anything related to Kirei again!
Rin: Even Ryuudou thinks you're fine, and he almost never likes girls. Shame, he's missing out on so much.
Saber: You told me he might have some latent sensing abilities. So of course he would accord me proper respect as his elder.
Rin: Elder. Claiming seniority here?
Saber: You're the exception. After all, you are my praiseworthy host.
Rin: Oh geez. You're getting to be as bad as Emiya-kun. Are you competing to see who can come up with the most ridiculous compliments?
Saber: No. Why wouldn't I tell the truth?
Rin: Nnnngh. Why are you here again?
Saber: I'm here to stay. Don't you need a second person to sit on your suitcase?
Rin: Hah! Well, it would be a pity if you left. Now come help with this stupid thing—I absolutely refuse to pay extra for another piece of luggage.

Rin: Your hair ribbon's awfully old, Sakura.
Saber: I believe it suits you. Thank you for the meal, Sakura; I always enjoy your cooking. Rin and I will discuss manners on our walk home.
Rin: You! I don't need anyone to tell me about manners. I just thought—
Rin: Here. You can't wear the same one all the time, right? I guess it can't be helped. This one's newer, and you can use both if you want.
Saber: *watches Sakura's face turning red with embarrassment and pure delight*"
2,3774955,Saber,Sakura,"Saber: That was kind, she said. Sakura doesn't lose her composure that easily.
Rin: We don't owe each other anything, she said abruptly. It's just a ribbon—I thought she could use another one.
Saber: So you gave her something because you wanted to, said Saber.
Rin: That's right. I felt like it.
Saber: *swallowed the words down in silence*

Rin: I never liked him, even when I was a kid, she confessed to Saber. Now it's like he's tormenting me from beyond the grave. The Tohsaka properties are all messed up, and his organization system is terrible. I can just see him smiling. Argh! Serves him right that Lancer killed him.
Saber: A pity Lancer had him for a Master, Saber said. I would've liked to fight him again.
Saber: *looked up at the sky*
Saber: No, she answered herself. A foolish question. She did not like Kiritsugu, but King Arthur had desired the Grail. She would not have hesitated to cut Lancer down, just as she would've done the same to Rin. If Shirou hadn't stopped her... Saber had been inflamed with anger at the time. How long had it been since she was forced against her will by a Command Seal? How long since the hill of death, and the destruction wrought by her own holy sword? A pity he stopped me, Saber had thought fleetingly.
Saber: You're smiling.
Rin: Is this so interesting to you? Running diagnostics on the defenses?
Saber: Ah, not that, replied Saber. I was thinking of the time I was about to kill you.
Rin: Is that your happy thought?
Saber: Not at all, Saber said; Rin's disgruntlement amused her. My thoughts are much kinder to you now.
Rin: As they should!"
3,3774955,Rin,Saber,"Rin: I feed you, I house you, I provide you with prana, and what do you do? Don’t answer that. You can explore Fuyuki as much as you like. And well, to be fair, I have to admit that if I had to die I’d rather be killed by a woman like you.
Saber: Oh?
Rin: Don’t look like that. You’re strong and stunning. It can’t be helped.
Saber: It can’t be helped. Then, if I may speak frankly, Rin, you have also been a worthy enemy, a worthy ally—a good Master, and a better friend.
Rin: *blushes*
Saber: And so, let’s not talk of killing. I wouldn’t like you to leave me. I’m taking you with me, aren’t I?
Rin: *retorts*"
