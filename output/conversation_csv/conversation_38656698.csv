0,38656698,Obi-Wan,Cody,"Obi-Wan: Hello, Commander. I hope I'm not interrupting.
Cody: Of course not, General. Ma'am.
Obi-Wan: I was unsure if you've met. Commander Cody, this is Betta Kolvar.
Cody: Nice to meet you, *shakes her furry hand*"
1,38656698,Obi-Wan,Cody,"Obi-Wan: I was unsure if you’ve met. Commander Cody, this is Betta Kolvar. *Obi-Wan said, introducing Kolvar to Cody.*
Cody: Nice to meet you. *Cody said, shaking Kolvar's hand.*
Kolvar: You as well. *Kolvar replied.*
Obi-Wan: I was hoping, while we had a little free time, to introduce you to some of the men. That way, you can be sure that you’re getting a full spread of them in your pictures— it would be embarrassing to have a hundred pictures of Cody here but none of Trapper, for example. *Obi-Wan suggested.*
Kolvar: That’s a good idea. *Kolvar agreed.*
Obi-Wan: Care to walk with us, Commander? *Obi-Wan asked.*
Cody: Certainly, General. *Cody replied.*
Boil: Updated supply list, sir. *Boil said, holding out a datapad towards General Kenobi.*
Kolvar: And what’s your name? *Kolvar asked.*
Obi-Wan: *looked affronted.*
Boil: I’m Trooper… Liob, ma’am! Nice to meet you, ma’am! *Boil introduced himself.*
Kolvar: Nice to meet you, trooper. *Kolvar replied.*
Cody: Thank you, Liob. You’re dismissed. *Cody dismissed Boil.*
Cody: *looked over at General Kenobi, who had a hand over his mouth, the picture of thoughtfulness.*
Cody: Of course I’m sure, sir— uh, ma’am. Clear as day. That’s Liob. *Boil said, talking to Kolvar.*
Cody: *walked over there double-time.*
Cody: *managed to get a good look at whatever they were hunched over.*"
2,38656698,Cody,Liob,"Cody: Of course I’m sure, sir— uh, ma’am. Clear as day. That’s Liob.
Boil: Thank you very much! Boil, right?
Cody: *looming behind Boil*
Cody: It’s so ugly. Why did you decorate it like this?
Leaffall: We decided Liob is really whimsical, and we didn’t want him to get confused with any other clones.
Cody: Maybe we should give him a mustache on the outside of the helmet. He seems like that kind of guy.
Cody: I hate you all so much.
Waxer: Wow, there you are, vod! We’ve been looking for you, Liob.
Gearshift: Looking hot, Liob.
Boil: Thank you, thank you. I’m here all day.
Cody: Oh, come on, don’t be mean to Liob—
Kolvar: Hello again, Cody, Liob, Waxer… um, Soup? I’m sorry. I don’t remember everyone’s names."
3,38656698,Kolvar,Cody,"Kolvar: er… um, Soup? I’m sorry. I don’t remember everyone’s names, *Kolvar said.*
Cody: I was talking to Master Kenobi, to see if he wanted to do any staged shots while we had some downtime. *Cody said.*
Kolvar: He said he was very busy with his Jedi rites, but he thought that you men might be amenable to me taking some pictures of you during your off-hours? *Kolvar showed them her holocam.*
Cody: I suppose so. I’m not sure anyone would want to see pictures of us playing sabacc or sparring, though, miss. *Cody said.*
Kolvar: You’d be surprised. My ratings have gone way up as of late. The galaxy likes to see pictures of the troops. *Kolvar said.*
Cody: All right, then, as you wish. Be good to her, men— I’m off to take ration inventory. *Cody said.*
Cody: Be good to her, Liob. *Cody said.*
Cody: Cody saluted, and ducked out of the tent, whistling. *Cody said.*
Cody: Cody took a look through the next batch of Kolvar’s photographs when they were released, out of more morbid curiosity than anything. *Cody said.*
Cody: Actually, it was kind of nice. Cody didn't have pictures of any of his brothers, except for a holopic of him and Rex from some shore leave. Cody saved some of them to his personal datapad. *Cody said.*
Cody: At the moment, Waxer and Boil were trying to convince him that Boil had lost his armor and needed a full replacement. *Cody said.*
Cody: “It fell… off a cliff,” Cody repeated. “All of your armor fell off a cliff.” *Cody said.*
Boil: “Yessir,” Boil said.
Cody: “How did your armor get to this cliff without you inside it?” *Cody said.*
Boil: “The Force?” *Boil said.*
Cody: “Do you think I’m an idiot?” *Cody said.*
Boil: “We’d never say that, sir!” Boil said, sounding completely affronted.
Cody: *Cody put his head on the desk. Then, without his meaning to, a laugh slipped out.*
Waxer: “We broke him,” Waxer whispered, loudly.
Cody: “If Liob wants armor, you’re going to have to be smarter about it than this,” *Cody said, rejecting the armor request on the datapad. “That kind of big requisition gets noticed. But, perhaps, if you rounded up a couple troopers, who had somehow all lost a pauldron, or a greave, or a utility belt…”*"
4,38656698,Obi-Wan,Cody,"Obi-Wan: Hello, Waxer, Boi—? *trailed off, seemingly confused.*
Cody: Liob is on the roster? *asks, then* Wait, leave next week is only for the higher ranks.
Liob: It's me, sir, *he said sheepishly.* Manacle.
Cody: Something wrong with your own armor?
Manacle: *muttered something.*
Cody: Speak up.
Manacle: Waxer and Boil said I could borrow him, *he said begrudgingly.* Liob has leave coming up, sir, and there’s a girl I want to see on the starbase tomorrow.
Cody: You make sure your duties are getting done if you must go see your girlfriend, *he said.* If they’re not, I will know."
5,38656698,Cody,Kolvar,"Cody: You make sure your duties are getting done if you must go see your girlfriend. If they're not, I will know. *rubbed his forehead* Everything alright, Commander Cody?
Kolvar: Yes, ma'am. I was just congratulating Corporal Liob. He got promoted.
Cody: *smiling* Obi-Wan, Force help him, was very fond of Liob. The news made him smile, even wider when Kolvar expressed delight at Liob's moving up in the ranks.
Rex: *slung an arm around Cody's shoulders* Cody!
501st members: Cody!
Cody: *making eye contact with the bartender* Ale, please.
Rex: Hey, you shouldn't have to pay! After all, you're a celebrity!
Cody: What?
Rex: No need to be modest. *handing over a datapad* The holonet was open to a news page—a page, as it turned out, which was full of Betta Kolvar's photographs of the 212th. A lot of them.
Cody: *looking through the photos* Oh no.
Rex: *zooming in on a holo where Cody was in mid-leap over a piece of a downed walker* I like this one. So dashing.
Cody: *giving him a dead-eyed look* She actually got these published? Kind of violent, no?
Rex: The public loves them. *clicking another link*"
6,38656698,Cody,Rex,"Cody: Why? *asked*
Rex: You're popular. *said and wiped a pretend tear from his eye* My brother, the holostar.
Cody: It's not that I'm scared sir. *said* It's just that right about now is when Skywalker's Law kicks in.
Obi-Wan: Skywalker's Law? *asked, amused*
Cody: The quickest way for a mission to go sideways is for things to be going well. *said* And most especially when a Jedi is around.
Obi-Wan: I wish I could argue with you. *said* But this one is about your troopers.
Cody: Kark. *said* What did they do now?
Obi-Wan: It seems that somehow our trooper did not get some of the required medical work for field soldiers. *said* I can't imagine how that happened.
Cody: Do you think you would notice, sir, if I pushed some of my brothers out the airlock? *said*
Obi-Wan: Well, he's there, and apparently the office of the Supreme Chancellor is quite concerned that he may have missed some mandatory vaccinations. *said* As of now, Liob is on leave— far away from any medcenters. I'm afraid the men will have to figure out how to deal with it the next time it pops up.
Cody: I honestly think they like the challenge. *said* There may be something actually wrong with them.
Unknown teenager: It's you! *gasped* There may be something actually wrong with them."
7,38656698,Cody,Obi-Wan,"Cody: Uh, do I know you?
Teenage boy: You're Cody! We saw you on the holonet!
Cody: Nice... to hear that?
Teenage girl: You're my favorite clone.
Another teenager: I like Boil. No offense, Mr. Cody.
Cody: That's all right.
Different teenager: Well, I like General Kenobi. Do you think you could get me an autograph?
Cody: I don't think he would appreciate the request.
Teenager: I can't believe we got saved by the 212th. Everyone on the forums is going to be so jealous.
First boy: We saw the last batch of photographs, and you were on a planet like two sectors from here. That was only like a week ago.
Teenage girl: That's so far! That means you've been fighting or traveling, for, like, forever without a break. Aren't you tired?
Cody: A little.
Teenager: You should get a break. That's horrible.
Cody: Well, that's the job—
Cody: Get inside and stay there.
Cody: Kriff.
Obi-Wan: We have many injured troopers. It's going to be difficult to defend with just us.
Cody: Which is, of course, why they decided to do it now."
8,38656698,Obi-Wan,Cody,"Obi-Wan: We have many injured troopers. It's going to be difficult to defend with just us.
Cody: Which is, of course, why they decided to do it now.
Obi-Wan: Well, nothing for it, I suppose, yes Commander?
Cody: Yessir.
B1: Surrender now, Jedi! Or be destroyed!
Obi-Wan: *ignites lightsaber*
Cody: *charges gun*
Teenager: Yeah, kriff off, clankers!
Obi-Wan: What in the world?
Teenager: They're tired! And they don't want to fight you right now. Go away.
Cody: Oh no.
Obi-Wan: That, I suppose, is one way to solve the problem.
Cody: This was the first time Skywalker would meet Betta Kolvar.
Anakin: Obi-Wan! How are you doing, Master?
Obi-Wan: Good...
Ahsoka: Make any new friends?
Obi-Wan: You're going to have to just tell me what this is about.
Anakin: We want to meet Liob!"
9,38656698,Anakin,Obi-Wan,"Anakin: Make any new friends?
Obi-Wan: You're going to have to just tell me what this is about.
Anakin: We want to meet Liob!
Cody: *let out a wheeze that he managed to turn into a cough at the very last second.*
Obi-Wan: What?
Anakin: *shoved a holo in front of Obi-Wan's face* This guy!
Obi-Wan: *put a hand over his mouth* Hm. Do you want to take a look at this, Commander?
Cody: *looked at the holo.*
Cody: *gave him a blank stare through the helmet.*
Obi-Wan: *laughed.*
Anakin: If this guy can make Obi-Wan laugh.
Tano: On a battlefield no less.
Anakin: We just have to meet him. I want to hear the joke he said. I can't believe you never introduced us before.
Cody: Sergeant Major Liob's away. He's on latrine duty with Waxer and Boil for the very foreseeable future.
Anakin: Aww, man. Are you sure we can't meet him?
Obi-Wan: Very.
Anakin: Well, then, I want to go over the plan for tomorrow."
10,38656698,Cody,General Kenobi,"Cody: I don't know, General Kenobi said, peering through a pair of electro-binocs at the facility looming in the distance. The space around the factory is very visible—it will be hard to sneak in from any side, even if you men try to distract from my approach from the inside.
Cody: Shut up, Cody said, glaring back at them, particularly Waxer and Boil. If you blow this, you’re going to wish for latine duty.
Cody: That’s us, Cody said. I’m Commander Cody, and this is my second-in-command, Lieutenant… Liob. Liob had gone up two ranks while they were wrestling Obi-Wan into his armor— no one wanted the General to be down a rank from them.
Cody: Sorry, Cody said. He had urgent business to attend to elsewhere, sent us instead.
Liob: I hope that’s amenable, Liob said.
Reptilian: You’re the clone army from the Republic? they asked.
Cody: That’s us, Cody said. I’m Commander Cody, and this is my second-in-command, Lieutenant… Liob.
Liob: Sorry, Cody said. He had urgent business to attend to elsewhere, sent us instead.
Reptilian: No Jedi? the reptilian asked, trying not to sound too hopeful as they craned their neck to look around the troops.
Cody: Sorry, Cody said. He had urgent business to attend to elsewhere, sent us instead.
Reptilian: Oh, yes! the reptilian said, very obviously relieved. Come on in.
Cody: Cody exchanged looks with… Liob.
Soup: Oh, gee, said someone from the back— Soup. What does this door lead to?
Soup: Whoopsie, Soup said, as the reptilian hurried to close the door and reset the alarm.
Cody: Their guide distracted, Cody covered the hallway while General Kenobi slipped off around the corner, still wearing that hideous armor, but quiet and stealthy as ever.
Cody: When the guide turned back, the ranks had closed in to cover the gap, and if they’d had their helmets off, their faces would all have been perfectly innocent."
11,38656698,Cody,Waxer,"Cody: Please don't touch anything.
Waxer: So, how does this equipment work?
Boil: And what's the weather like on this planet?
Cody's comm: Ah, it seems I've encountered a problem.
Obi-Wan: The good news is that we can confirm they're making munitions here.
Cody: Where are you, sir? We'll come get you.
Obi-Wan: Oh, I don't think you'll have any trouble finding me.
Cody: Ask a stupid question...
Cody: I'm sorry, they can't send new boots until the Negotiator refuels.
Cody: We've been waiting for two months.
Obi-Wan: I know, and I've told them that we need it.
Cody: Budget cuts.
Cody: How much longer do you reckon we can last? Frostbite's already a concern.
Obi-Wan: Trust me, I'm well-aware."
12,38656698,Cody,Obi-Wan,"Cody: How much longer do you reckon we can last? Frostbite’s already a concern. Most of the troops’ shoes are already all but worn-though.
Obi-Wan: Trust me, I’m well-aware. I think our only choice is to finish this campaign as soon as possible. The Senate is being typically obtuse on this.
Cody: When aren’t they?
Cody: Sorry, ma’am.
Kolvar: Don’t mind me. A little harmless complaining never hurt me.
Obi-Wan: I have a little bit of liquid synth-leather left. I’d better go give it to Wooley before he terrorizes the new recruits too much.
Kolvar: Hold on. Wait on that a second.
Cody: Taking pictures of courageous deeds is one thing, but Wooley screwing off?
Kolvar: You’ll see. Excuse me? Crys? Is your boot still broken too?
Crys: Yes ma’am.
Kolvar: Can you show me?
Crys: *shows the bottom of his foot, where the sole of his standard-issue was tearing away*
Kolvar: That’s perfect. Anyone else?
Cody: We’re not scheduled for anything.
Materiel: It just came in on the list this morning. I verified it, sir. No trick.
Cody: All right.
Soft-shell clone: I don’t know who you had to blackmail, bribe, or otherwise kill, but I sure wish I was in on it.
Cody: *raises an eyebrow*
Supplier: There’s another box of these. Two of cold-weather gear, and one of recreation supplies.
Cody: Kriff. Who did kill somebody for this?
Cody: Do you know where General Kenobi is?"
13,38656698,Cody,Manacle,"Cody: Kriff. Who did kill somebody for this? *snags a clone out of the mass gathering around the coveted boots* Do you know where General Kenobi is?
Manacle: I saw him going into the communications tent. Are these really boots?
Cody: *points a finger at him* You're responsible for distributing these now. One pair, each man. And you save a pair for me and a pair for General Kenobi.
Manacle: Yessir. *lights up as a man with the power to control his brothers with only a few pairs of boots* I'm not going to make you have a cage fight to see which one of you gets the boots first, but I'm just saying I'd like a little entertainment...
Cody: *walks away on that* It was fine. It was probably fine.
Cody: *steps forward* I suppose now I don't have to ask where all these supplies came from.
Obi-Wan: There was a recent outpouring of support for the troops, particularly the 212th.
Cody: I didn't know you had it in you, ma'am.
Chiss Senator: I may not be that familiar with the horrors of war, but I do know bad press. The public has become quite attached to you boys. They called into the Senate in droves to get you those boots."
14,38656698,Wan,Cody,"Wan: I didn’t know you had it in you, ma’am.
Cody: I may not be that familiar with the horrors of war, but I do know bad press.
Kolvar: *fur ruffled with pride*
Wan: The public has become quite attached to you boys. They called into the Senate in droves to get you those boots.
Cody: Are you in much trouble?
Obi-Wan: In the end people are donating more to the war effort. It is, overall, a win.
Kolvar: *about to become the most popular member of this army*
Cody: *did not know how he had been persuaded into this, but here he was*
Cody: I am not.
Longshot: But don’t you want to support Liob’s promotion? Did you at least bring him a gift?
Cody: I did not.
Longshot: *a little misty-eyed, and wobbled away*
Boil: If only Liob could be here.
Waxer: Unfortunately, as we all know, he’s off on a top-secret mission. They say he kicked a Sith in the face, and General Yoda personally asked him to go Sith-hunting.
Soup: I heard Liob used the Force on accident and now they’re training him as a Jedi!
Waxer: Well, I wasn’t supposed to tell you boys this, but yes, he is in fact in Jedi training. I hear his lightsaber is green. No. Pink.
Cody: *hid a smile behind his drink*
Crys: *got booed off the stage from one half of the room, the other half laughing and telling him to come back and tell some more*
Kenobi: *came to the party, late*
Skywalker: *came to the party, late*"
15,38656698,Cody,Skywalker,"Cody: This is quite the turnout. This guy must be really popular.
Skywalker: You wouldn't believe it.
Cody: So can I meet Captain Liob? Where is he?
Cody: Sorry, sir. I'm afraid he's off on assignment. Classified. A last-minute sort of thing. He wouldn't mind us celebrating without him.
Skywalker: Everyone else gets to meet him but me! Tenday told me that Liob karate chopped straight through his chains one time when he got captured.
Obi-Wan: That sounds just like him.
Skywalker: Force, he sounds like fun. Not like you two. You wouldn't know fun if it hit you in the face. When's the last time you even broke a regulation, Cody?
Cody: Can't recall.
Obi-Wan: *snorted his drink a little, and Cody felt his mouth twitch*
Skywalker: The 212th is weird.
Cody: Howzit, sir?
Waxer: Oh, you know.
Cody: Any word from the 501st?
Cody: Not yet.
Waxer: That'll wake you up.
Cody: *swore and pushed Waxer off him*
Cody: Waxer, Boil. Maybe take Representative Kolvar back to the gunships.
Cody: I'm not going."
16,38656698,Kolvar,Cody,"Kolvar: I'm not going, *actively protecting something*
Cody: What are you doing?
Kolvar: I'm uploading today's pictures to my editor.
Peel: Why?
Kolvar: If we die here, this will be the only thing left. Don't you want them to know what happened?
Wooley: I don't think anyone will care.
Kolvar: They'll care. They have to care. That's what this is all about.
Cody: Thanks for caring, ma'am.
Cody: Sir, *reproachfully*
Obi-Wan: Oh, thank you, Cody.
Cody: It's my last one.
Obi-Wan: Well, we shan't tell Anakin about that, yes?
Cody: Agreed."
17,38656698,Obi-Wan,Cody,"Obi-Wan: Can you take a look at this, Commander? *hands a datapad over*
Cody: What is it? *flips through it*
Obi-Wan: Another request to send Liob in to complete his medical file.
Cody: I thought the men already took care of that— they got Fracture to sign off and everything.
Obi-Wan: Precisely. But now I have messages from Kamino and the Office of The Supreme Chancellor saying he’s missing important medical procedures.
Cody: What kind of procedures?
Obi-Wan: That’s precisely what I want to know. I read over the medical file the men made up— everything is in there that should be in there. It’s the same as yours or any other clone’s. And it should be impossible for any parts of these files to be classified from me, or from you.
Cody: You think there’s something classified in all our files that Liob’s is missing?
Obi-Wan: I don’t know. That’s what I’m worried about.
Cody: Seems like another inspection tour is due, yes? Me, Rex, Kamino?
Obi-Wan: Very due, yes. I’ll sign off on it. Perhaps you can take Ahsoka along— a learning experience.
Cody: Yes sir. That sounds like a good plan.
Cody: I wondered if the boys had given you Liob’s personal comm number yet. In case you wanted to contact him while he was on shore leave.
Obi-Wan: I don’t believe so.
Cody: Waxer and Boil can give it to you. Liob did indeed have a comm— this was, mostly, so that the vod could use it for prank calls, and also so that whoever was being Liob could contact the others. But the number wasn’t in any Republic database, and more importantly, no one in the Chancellor’s office knew about it.
Obi-Wan: I’ll ask them.
Cody: Please do. We’re almost finished with inspections here— just a few things to finish up."
18,38656698,Cody,Obi-Wan,"Cody: I’ll ask them.
Obi-Wan: Please do.
Cody: We’re almost finished with inspections here— just a few things to finish up.
Obi-Wan: All right. I will get on that immediately.
Cody: May the Force be with you.
Ahsoka: May the Force be with all of us.
Cody: I’m sorry. It really was an instinct!
Cody: We can’t just remove them. We don’t know what kind of damage that could do to you.
Cody: But I’d let Stitches or Fracture rip it out with a rusty pair of scissors if I had to. I want it gone.
Rex: General Ti said she would keep working on slicing into the orders on the chip so she could change them.
Rex: But I don’t like the idea that it could happen at all, or that it could be hacked again after that.
Ahsoka: She found us stuffing a couple bodies into a closet. It’s fine. She was as horrified as the rest of us when she found out. She’ll help us.
Obi-Wan: I’m not going to ask whose bodies.
Obi-Wan: It seems fairly obvious who stands the most to gain from all the orders— it must be the Chancellor.
Rex: Demagolka.
Obi-Wan: Indeed. Which means, so far as we know, all our lines of communication and official avenues are compromised.
Ahsoka: We should tell Skyguy, right?
Rex: The General is pretty close with the Chancellor. I’m not saying he knows! He would never do that! I’m just saying the guy can’t keep a secret to save his life.
Obi-Wan: We’ll handle this internally, insomuch as that is possible, for now.
Cody: I’ll talk to Stitches. I’m sure he can come up with a way to remove the control chips safely. Once he does— maybe a shipwide flu? Not bad, but something that requires quarantine. Maybe something that only affects clones.
Ahsoka: Good idea. I can tell Anakin I’m staying here to help since the 212th will be shorthanded because of the all the casualties. And Rex can’t risk spreading it to his brothers.
Obi-Wan: It’s going to cause panic.
Cody: The vod can handle it. They'll stay cool.
Rex: Question is whether the Senate will. The 212th will be out of action for a while."
19,38656698,Obi-Wan,Ahsoka,"Obi-Wan: I want to talk to you, *walks towards Ahsoka*, It's urgent!
Cody: What do you want to say? *stopped and looked back*
Rex: It's going to cause panic, Obi-Wan said. The vod can handle it, Cody said. They'll stay cool.
Rex: Question is whether the Senate will, Rex said. The 212th will be out of action for a while. Hopefully the 501st shortly after that, if you don't mind me saying so, sirs.
Obi-Wan: I'm sure we can organize a breach of the contagion, Obi-Wan said, amused. I'll keep the Senators at bay for a while.
Ahsoka: You guys do realize, Ahsoka said, There's someone on board whose job it literally is to document stuff like this and send it to the Senate.
Obi-Wan: “Oh,” Obi-Wan said. “Right.”
Kolvar: “Um, hello… sirs. And ma’am,” she said.
Ahsoka: Ahsoka made a face, visibly unused to being called ma’am, but said nothing.
Kolvar: “Did you… need me?” Kolvar asked.
Obi-Wan: “We have a mission of vital importance which we will be carrying out on this ship as soon as possible,” Obi-Wan said. “Unfortunately, it is very top secret.”
Kolvar: “Oh,” Kolvar said. “That’s all right; I’ve been cleared to take photos of classified ops. You approve the ones that go through to my editor, the rest of them go into an encrypted archive that will be de-classified fifty years after the war ends.”
Ahsoka: “That’s the thing,” Ahsoka said. “This is really, really top secret. The Senate can’t know. Not even the Council, not yet, until we can talk to them in person.”
Kolvar: “What do you mean?” Kolvar asked.
Obi-Wan: “I can’t order you to lie,” Obi-Wan said, though Cody thought if it was him he wouldn’t have told her that. “But we would appreciate your assistance covering up a very delicate matter.”
Kolvar: “Not unless you tell me what’s going on.”
Obi-Wan: “It is,” Obi-Wan said. “And I think you can guess why we don’t want this becoming public knowledge.”
Kolvar: “I’ll do whatever I need to to help. Just point me in the right direction.”
Cody: Rex was the first one to go through the surgery, though not for lack of volunteers. Cody attempted to go first but was shot down by virtue of his rank. Cody was pretty sure the other vod just didn’t want to have to deal with his paperwork if he died.
Cody: By all appearances things went well with the surgery— Stitches and his assistant Reflex came out of the surgery room after about an hour with a little chip in a vial. The brothers, many of whom had gathered around the entrance to the medbay door, buzzed with relief, elbowing each other and clapping arms around shoulders.
Cody: But then it was for the real test— they moved into the patient room with the glass wall. Rex was sitting up in bed, looking groggy and with a bacta patch on his temple but all right. He let Fracture cuff him to the bed, then everyone’s attention turned to Kolvar.
Cody: She was the only natborn on board who wasn’t also a Jedi. She looked nervous, but not so much as Cody felt. Obi-Wan and Ahsoka were gathered with the rest of the clones, who had all come unarmed. Just in case.
Cody: They had turned off the intercom, but Cody saw Kolvar’s lips form the words: execute Order 66. Nothing happened.
Rex: Rex blinked, then turned to give the glass partition a thumbs-up. They cheered.
Kolvar: To her credit, Kolvar did a really good job of helping them cover up the mass medical procedures going on onboard."
20,38656698,Cody,General Skywalker,"Cody: Uh, negative, negative. This ship is under quarantine— no drops in or out.
General Skywalker: Don't worry about it. This is General Skywalker. I'm here to drop off a care package for you boys.
Cody: Negative. The virus may be more… potent? Than we previously thought. Don't want to risk it.
General Skywalker: I can filter out viruses. We'll be fine. I wanted to see Snips— that is, Commander Tano, and General Kenobi anyway.
Cody: Um.
General Skywalker: Look, can I speak to Obi-Wan?
Cody: Please.
Obi-Wan: Anakin, we wouldn’t want to risk spreading this flu— it’s not deadly but it is quite an inconvenience. Perhaps you could come back again another time.
General Skywalker: I’ve got some care packages. Obi-Wan, what’s going on? That ship doesn’t feel sick.
Obi-Wan: I suppose you can touch down for a little while at least. Why don’t you land in Hangar Four. I’ll meet you there.
General Skywalker: Whoa! Thought we were supposed to be avoiding spreading this thing. I’ve got two clones onboard who wouldn’t appreciate getting sick.
Obi-Wan: About that.
Cody: I’ll go brief the men.
Ahsoka: *pleading look*
Rex: *puts a hand on Ahsoka’s shoulder*
General Skywalker: *getting angry*"
21,38656698,Echo,Cody,"Echo: Sir! I thought we were supposed to be minimalizing contact. Because of the flu?
Cody: There's no flu. You've just stumbled on something big. I'll explain it to you while the Jedi talk it out outside.
Fives: If there's no flu, can't we go out there, vod?
Cody: Trust me, you're gonna want to wait. Skywalker's not going to like what he hears.
Obi-Wan: You'll need to leave soon. We can only claim engine troubles for so long before people start to get suspicious.
Cody: It is General Skywalker, sir.
Skywalker: Hey, thanks, Cody! Hey, wait, do you mean they wouldn't believe it because I'm such a good mechanic, or that they would because I'm always breaking stuff?
Cody: *innocently*
Obi-Wan: You'll have to take off soon. Our medic team has written a protocol for getting the chips out. It's an easy enough procedure once you've had enough practice. We haven't had any fatalities.
Skywalker: But what after that?
Ahsoka: Master Ti is trying to hack into the chips from Kamino, along with some of the clones there. Maybe she'll be able to fix it so we don't have to do the surgeries anymore.
Skywalker: Then what? We assassinate Palpatine?
Fives: I could make the shot from a couple buildings away. No one would ever even know it was us.
Cody: *This sounded like a good plan to Cody.*
Ahsoka: Not the worst idea—
Obi-Wan: We'll think of other options.
Skywalker: I don't like leaving Snips here. I'm her Master, and if the Chancellor really has it out for the Jedi, I should be with her.
Obi-Wan: Ahsoka can take care of herself, Anakin. She'll be fine. I'll keep an eye out.
Skywalker: All right, I guess we should be off, then. You boys ready?"
22,38656698,Obi-Wan,Ahsoka,"Obi-Wan: Ahsoka can take care of herself, Anakin. She'll be fine. I'll keep an eye out.
Anakin: I should be with her.
Obi-Wan: All right, I guess we should be off, then.
Anakin: You boys ready?
Cody: Just tell them one of the men broke quarantine, and you didn't find out until too late.
Anakin: Now what soldier would want to take that kind of a fall?
Obi-Wan: Major Liob has already volunteered to take full responsibility.
Anakin: What a stand-up guy. Hey! This is finally my chance to meet him!
Cody: He's recovering in the medbay as we speak. And you're already late.
Anakin: I always miss out on the fun stuff.
Obi-Wan: Wait a second, what was it you were bringing to us in the first place?
Anakin: I told you. Care packages!
Obi-Wan: Dear 212th, I saw on the holonews those pictures of you being sick. I feel really bad that you have to do battles and you still can get colds. I hope this helps. Love, Irina, age 11.
Cody: Those could be poisoned.
Longshot: The note says the Coruscant Guard already checked everything out. And— hey, they took samples of all the baked goods! There's crumbs on this.
Obi-Wan: It seems our photographer has come in handy once more. Enjoy, men.
Boil: You don't want to join us, sir?
Obi-Wan: They're obviously for you.
Cody: For the 212th. Here. Take a box.
Soup: A stuffed tooka! It has little paws!
Oddball: Another tray of cookies and a huge package of something called hot chocolate.
Rex: *no dialogue*"
23,38656698,Waxer,Cody,"Waxer: Dear 212th Attack Battalion, *read out* To smoother landings.
Cody: And how do you plan on doing that?
Boil: Um, rude... guy... Chancellor Palpatine.
Senator Amidala: You want me to do fripping what?
Obi-Wan: I know it sounds crazy. Believe me, I know.
Amidala: Do you?
Obi-Wan: We must find out exactly what's going on.
Cody: And to do that, we're going to need to get into his office in the Senate and his private apartments.
Amidala: So call in a bomb threat.
Obi-Wan: And have even closer surveillance on the building? Not a good idea.
Amidala: Okay, okay, fine."
24,38656698,Amidala,Obi-Wan,"Amidala: So call in a bomb threat.
Obi-Wan: And have even closer surveillance on the building? Not a good idea.
Amidala: Okay, okay, fine. Exactly what is it you need me to do?
Cody: I’m sure I can do it, sir.
Obi-Wan: Nonsense. I’m perfectly capable with a sniper rifle.
Cody: How did Kolvar react when you asked her to help?
Obi-Wan: Actually, it went rather well. Turns out she knew that our Liob was not quite so real as we had implied.
Cody: What? How? Even General Skywalker hasn’t figured it out.
Obi-Wan: Anakin is not exactly the shining example of intuitiveness. Apparently, she figured it out a few weeks in. When he came out with a lightsaber is when she really realized.
Cody: She didn’t believe the boys’ story about a Force-sensitive clone?
Obi-Wan: She did not.
Cody: Why didn’t she mention anything?
Obi-Wan: I believe she thought it was funny.
Cody: What else did she say?
Obi-Wan: That she’d miss him."
25,38656698,Waxer,Cody,"Waxer: We should probably run.
Cody: *transfixed on the scene below* No.
Waxer: Not you, Liob.
Boil: Is the Senator all right?
Amidala: I'm fine, soldier. Don't worry about me.
Boil: Oh Force, this is the end for me.
Waxer: No, you can't. You're the bravest man I've ever known.
Padme: *hides a smile*
Boil: Just remember me. You know. Me. Liob. Remember me. I do this for the Senator, but most importantly... for the Republic.
Waxer: Noooo-oooo!!!
Cody: Okay, we really need to run now.
Chancellor Palpatine: Obviously we're going to have to have a funeral service. Give the people closure, and all that.
Cody: Regimental Commander Liob was a, well, brave clone. But a public funeral seems like it is overreacting a touch.
Obi-Wan: He did save a Senator's life. A very well-known Senator.
Kolvar: To tell you the truth, I don't know how you would get away without it. The public is very much mourning Liob.
Cody: What does that mean?
Kolvar: They have set up several informal shrines throughout the city. Candlelight vigils and that sort of thing. Flowers and little gifts.
Cody: They have?
Senator: We'll have to show we care. Perhaps a funeral would be a good idea...
Cody: *pushes and shoves his way in among his brothers*"
26,38656698,Cody,Palpatine,"Cody: Perhaps a funeral would be a good idea... *pushed and shoved and elbowed his way in among his brothers so he could be near the front*
Cody: *pushed Waxer and Boil aside and stepped out a little bit in front, to where Obi-Wan and Anakin were standing together* Maybe Palpatine was trying to take advantage of the moment by putting her in the line of fire.
Cody: *looking at Palpatine* He was standing on the stage with the rest of the Senators, looking, to Cody’s eyes, insufferably smug.
Cody: *as the ceremony started* The Chancellor had to speak first, showing his support for the troops, the Republic, etc.
Cody: *thinking* Cody didn’t think Palpatine realized the significance of what he was doing. The future implications that would rise out of this.
Cody: *as Padme took the stage* Her speech was much lovelier. She, of course, knew that no clone had died for her, but you wouldn’t guess it by the solemn way she was acting.
Cody: *as Padme began to read a piece of Nubian poetry* He died for her. He was a good man.
Cody: *as Crys tapped Obi-Wan on the shoulder* He whispered something in his ear, all looking very serious and grave. Cody wondered what he was actually saying.
Obi-Wan: *thanking Crys* Then gestured for Cody to follow him, and they made a discreet exit from the funeral.
Cody: *following Obi-Wan out of the funeral and into the speeder* Everyone would assume this was super-secret, super-serious Jedi business. And, from a certain point of view, they’d be right.
Cody: *as they sped towards the Senate* The funeral continued to drone on in the background, loud and definitely destined to last a long time.
Cody: *as they entered the Chancellor's office undetected* If there was something here to find, it would be very well-hidden."
27,38656698,Chancellor Palpatine,Liob,"Cody: Do you know what that means?
Obi-Wan: It means that Chancellor Palpatine is, indeed, the Sith Lord.
Cody: Well, yes. But it also means that he doesn't have his weapon.
Waxer: Everything all right?
Cody: So much as it can be. Is it suspicious that you put on your helmet to talk to us?
Waxer: Nah. They think I'm trying to cover up my manful tears. This is the best funeral I've ever been to.
Boil: It's the only funeral you've ever been to, stupid.
Obi-Wan: I'm sorry, but we are on a bit of a time constraint.
Waxer: What do you need us to do?
Cody: We're working on concrete evidence. But that might take a while, and you know the Chancellor will be able to wriggle out of most things short of a direct confession.
Obi-Wan: So here's what we need you to do. I think you're going to like this one.
Boil: I'm sorry to interrupt. But we can't stay silent on this any longer.
Waxer: As Liob's two closest friends— He entrusted only the two of us with some very secret information."
28,38656698,Waxer,Boil,"Waxer: As Liob's two closest friends— He entrusted only the two of us with some very secret information.
Boil: Senator Amidala was, in fact, only a secondary target of this assassination plot. The real intended victim was... Liob.
Waxer: Liob had uncovered a major conspiracy of the war. Being the brave, kind—
Boil: Selfless.
Waxer: Yeah, selfless, man that he was, Liob decided to secretly launch an investigation.
Boil: An investigation... Into Chancellor Palpatine!
Palpatine: This is preposterous.
Amidala: Actually, I can confirm... Liob had begun to ask me to investigate this topic. He was being very careful. Not saying much. Senior Commander Liob believed that Chancellor Palpatine was in fact masterminding the war, and was secretly supporting the Separatists.
Waxer: Palpatine had him murdered! And he tried to take Senator Amidala out too!"
29,38656698,Chancellor Palpatine,Jedi,"Kolvar: Chancellor Palpatine! What about the accusations from the Jedi that you are a Sith Lord?
Palpatine: These accusations are ridiculous. Troopers, take your malfunctioning brothers away. Execute Order—
Amidala: Don't try it.
Cody: *felt his lip curl with distaste* They had known Palpatine was behind Order 66, behind the control chips, but confirmation of it was something else.
Palpatine: *looked around at the crowds* Cody could see the mental kriff it in his eyes.
Palpatine: *spun and pushed out with his hands, sending troopers and politicians alike flying at the touch of the invisible force*
Amidala: *ducked low to the ground and popped back up with her blaster at the ready, unmoved*
Palpatine: *knocked the blaster away* reached out his hands, fingers extended, and Cody felt a pulse of alarm as he saw blue electricity gathering there.
Anakin: *cut off both of Palpatine's hands*
Skywalker: Stay away from my wife.
Obi-Wan: *put his face in his hands* Dear Force.
Skywalker: *paused, looking at the cameras* Oh, whoops.
Cody: *thanked the Force for not assigning him to Skywalker*
Leaffall: One of the shinies told me they're going to weld a codpiece to Skywalker. Do you think that's true? Is that something the Jedi would do?
Fox: No way. Have you met Vos? If they were going to do it to anyone, Vos would have already gotten one.
Cody: *asked, somewhat desperately* Can't you discuss this somewhere else? I'm trying to do paperwork.
Rex: *reached over and took Cody's datapad out of his hands* Lighten up, vod."
30,38656698,Cody,Rex,"Cody: Can't you discuss this somewhere else? I'm trying to do paperwork.
Rex: *reaches over and takes Cody's datapad out of his hands, then tosses it across the room* Lighten up, vod. Skywalker cut off the Chancellor's hands. We're not going to be doing anything for a while.
Cody: You won't, maybe. Someone has to clean up after all of you.
Hardcase: Come on! Come play our newest game— Pin The Tail On The Sith.
Cody: Let me guess, it's one point for the face, two points for the eyes, and three if you get a knife up his nose?
Rex: He doesn't need explaining at all! Now let's see if you can break my record.
Cody: Please, any 212th soldier could beat a 501st with our eyes closed.
Rex: You're on.
Obi-Wan: Fun night, Commander?
Cody: Not sure what you're talking about, sir.
Obi-Wan: Ah, yes. My mistake.
Cody: No one should apologize while sounding that smug. Or being that loud."
31,38656698,Cody,Obi-Wan,"Cody: Fun night, Commander? *smirked*
Obi-Wan: Not sure what you're talking about, sir.
Cody: Ah, yes. My mistake.
Cody: No one should apologize while sounding that smug. Or being that loud.
Obi-Wan: I am sorry you had to come in today—I know that you were supposed to have today off. I don't know what this meeting is about either.
Cody: How are things going at the Temple?
Obi-Wan: Still in an uproar. The Council is unpleased with the way some events transpired. Our ex-Chancellor is still in the cells beneath the Temple. We think we've found sufficient evidence that he was in fact a Sith.
Obi-Wan: We did manage to get permission to sweep for the rest of the clones whose chips have not yet been removed, and get them to surgery should they so wish it.
Cody: That's good news.
Cody: Ma'am, I didn't know you would be here.
Betta Kolvar: Me either. It seems this was all very sudden.
Obi-Wan: I wonder what this is about. How have you been?
Betta Kolvar: The Senate ethics committee wants to speak to me about what I've witnessed as an outside observer during the war—so far as I know, they're quite upset at the realities that my holos have caught on film. Not to mention that people keep calling me to see if I can get a picture of General Skywalker in his underwear. My editors are going crazy. They finally agreed to let me go back out into the field again.
Cody: Why would you want to do that?
Betta Kolvar: I'm going to document the relief efforts. All the politicians involved are, I'm sure you can imagine, very pleased that someone is going to be along to ensure accountability in all areas.
Cody: You're much more evil than I thought, Ma'am.
Betta Kolvar: Why, thank you, Commander.
Obi-Wan: *smiled*
Mon Mothma: They're ready for you. Thank you for your patience.
Obi-Wan: It was no trouble.
Mon Mothma: Welcome. We appreciate you."
32,38656698,Cody,Obi-Wan,"Cody: I really can't believe this.
Obi-Wan: So we take this secret to our graves, yes?
Cody: Oh, yes, of course.
Kolvar: Absolutely. That's a given.
Cody: *exchanged one last hysterical, disbelieving glance*
Obi-Wan: *schooled their expressions once more, betraying nothing more than thoughtful solemnity*
Cody: *stepped out into the hustle and bustle of Coruscant* I couldn't wait to tell my brothers about this."
