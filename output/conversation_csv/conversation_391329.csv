0,391329,Draco,Potter,"Draco: Is there a reason you keep staring at me?
Potter: *looked up, his green eyes narrowed* You have a smudge on your left cheek.
Draco: Your other left.
Potter: *scowled and looked down at his essay again* I don't have a problem with it.
Draco: Don't be childish. Just wipe it off.
Potter: *ignored him* Mind your own business.
Draco: *picked up his wand and Conjured a small mirror* Here, have a look if you don't believe me.
Potter: *looked at the mirror* Suppose it makes sense you know how to Conjure pretty little mirrors on the spot.
Draco: You're easily impressed.
Potter: *went back to his essay without a word*
Draco: *stood up and strided toward Potter* Wipe it.
Potter: *looked at the handkerchief and then back at Draco*"
1,391329,Draco,Potter,"Draco: Fine, then, if you're so . . . Eager to show off. Then simply wish the smudge on your face to disappear.
Potter: If there really is a smudge on my cheek, it doesn't bother me, but it clearly caused you to have some sort of fit, so I think I'll keep it.
Draco: *grabbed the back of Potter's chair and bent forward slowly, deliberately, watching Potter's eyes grow wider*
Draco: *stuck out his tongue and gave the smudge a firm, wet lick — chocolate, definitely, he concluded.*
Draco: *licked Potter again; he licked to the left, to the right, he licked Potter's lips and then licked them again, and then one more time*
Draco: *straightened, nodded curtly at Potter's frozen, shocked expression*
Potter: *cleared his throat. He cleared his throat twice. Three times. Four.*
Draco: *looked up. Potter had a quill in his hand, pointy tip poised to his lips. It touched his bottom lip, smudging it with chocolate before it moved to his upper lip and did the same.*
Draco: *Apparated inside Hogwarts walls. That was the only sensible explanation as to how he had suddenly found himself right next to Potter again, kneeling next to Potter's chair, his hands in Potter's hair, trapping his head between his palms.*
Draco: *licked it off carefully, then kissed it away for good measure.*
Draco: *conducted a thorough search — with his lips and tongue — to make sure there wasn't any chocolate left on Potter's cheeks, and his jaw and his lips, and his mouth and his tongue; he even checked the tip of Potter's nose and the soft skin of his temples.*
Draco: *kissed away every trace of chocolate on Potter's skin, only to have it reappear again.*"
