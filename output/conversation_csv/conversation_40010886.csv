0,40010886,Harry,Minerva,"Harry: Five points from Slytherin!
Minerva: Minerva, shouldnâ€™t you stop them? I mean, Filius and I arenâ€™t complaining, but the students will be unhappy.
Minerva: They donâ€™t appear too unhappy, do they?
Filius: Iâ€™m unsure if it was wise to hire Harry so quickly. Heâ€™s still young and temperamentalâ€”
Minerva: You were saying about Harry being young and temperamental?
Filius: Are you going to even ask them to justify the points?
Minerva: Professor Snape, why did you remove fifty points from Gryffindor just now?
Severus: For having an incompetent, idiotic, impulsiveâ€”
Harry: Iâ€™m idiotic? YOU BROKE MY BROOM, SEVERUS.
Severus: Which broomstick was it?
Harry: The one I just bought last summer?
Severus: Good. Thirty more points from Gryffindor for unprofessionalism.
Harry: ONE HUNDRED POINTS FROM SLYTHERIN FOR THEIR HEAD OF HOUSE BREAKING MY BROOMSTICK!
Harry: YOU HIT ME WITH A BLUDGER, POTTER!
Harry: Oh, donâ€™t â€˜Potterâ€™ me, Snape. You shouldnâ€™t have been lurking aboutâ€¦
Minerva: You see?"
1,40010886,Harry,Snape,"Harry: Oh, don't 'Potter' me, Snape, *scowled as he followed hot on Severus' trail*. You shouldn't have been lurking about...
Minerva: You see? *said calmly as she took her seat once again as the two men carried their argument elsewhere*. Perfectly reasonable explanations for the point losses.
Pomona: I'm afraid that Gryffindor and Slytherin are going to be in dead last for the House Cup this year, Minerva. *nodded her head to the hourglasses where the points continued to disappear*. Of course they won't, *Minerva said, quite unconcerned and highly amused*. Severus and Harry will refill their own houses glasses by breakfast tomorrow. Watch, Pomona, you'll see.
Harry: You gave Russo eighty points for good dental hygiene?! *stormed in their classroom*.
Snape: I don't expect a dunderhead like you to understand the importance of hygiene, Potter, but it is highly undervalued, *drawled*. And, if your vision is not as impaired as your ridiculous glasses make it seem, perhaps you can notice I am in the middle of teaching?
Harry: I brush my teeth! *said hotly*.
Snape: Congratulations, *said sarcastically*. I suppose you'll be wanting an Order of Merlin for that as well?
Harry: I really want an Order of Merlin for brushing my teeth, Severus.
Snape: I propose you ask Kingsley then, Potter. In the meantime, I am teaching, so piss off.
Harry: *muttered something under his breath with a pointed look at the book Snape had been idly flicking through while the students worked on their potions*. Fine, *said louder, ignoring the way that Snape was ignoring him*. Remind me what your name is?
Mandy: Mandy Barrett, sir, *she said politely*.
Harry: You've got nice hair, eighty-one points to Gryffindor, Miss Barrett. *then turned and strolled out of the potions classroom with his head held high*. Snape waited until Harry's footsteps receded down the corridor to look up from..."
2,40010886,Mandy,Professor Snape,"Mandy: Youâ€™ve got nice hair, eighty-one points to Gryffindor, Miss Barrett.
Professor Snape: Try not to let Professor Potterâ€™s words go to your head. The man would not know nice hair if it smacked him in the face.
Mandy: I think he prefers dark hair anyway, sir.
Professor Snape: Quite so. Carry on.
Hector: Youâ€™re brave. If they donâ€™t figure it out by Christmas though, you owe me ten galleons.

Hermione: What on Earth?
Neville: Harry.
Harry: You guys want to sit with Minerva?
Hermione: Sure.
Professor Snape: Potter, you do understand that, as incredible as it may seem, you are a professor now and expected to dress with a sense of professionalism, correct?"
3,40010886,Hermione,Snape,"Hermione: , you do understand that, as incredible as it may seem, you are a professor now and expected to dress with a sense of professionalism, correct? *Hermione bristled at Snapeâ€™s curt words and she looked Harry over carefully. She thought he looked lovely in his maroon dress shirt and his casual black robes over it. In fact, Hermione looked more carefully at Harry, Harry looked like he had put a bit more thought in his appearance than usual. She was pretty sure his hair was even combed.*
Harry: Severus, you do understand that, as incredible as it may seem, this is Christmas break and professors donâ€™t actually have to wear twenty layers of robes, correct? *Harry asked with a quirked eyebrow. Hermione bit her lip and glanced at Ron as the two of them tried to stifle their laughter. It wasnâ€™t funny, not really, Hermione had hoped that Harry and Snape could get along now that the war was over and they were coworkers, but she could see that some things never changed.*
Snape: Five points from Gryffindor, Potter.
McGonagall: Six points from Slytherin, Severus.
Hermione: *Hermioneâ€™s head turned to McGonagall, her mouth open in a little â€˜oâ€™ of indignation for the blatant abuse of the points system, but McGonagall merely shared a secret and sly smile with Sprout and summoned a bottle of wine.* Would anyone care for a drink?
Ron: Yes, please.
McGonagall: *Professor McGonagall poured six glasses of wine and passed them out to each other them.* Merry Christmas, *she said with a twinkle in her eyes as she raised her glass. May we all receive exactly what we desire tonight, *she added with a quick flick of those twinkling eyes towards Snape.*
Ron: Cheers, *Ron said merrily as he clinked glasses with her. Never thought Iâ€™d be having wine with you, Professor, *he laughed. Mad world, eh?
McGonagall: And it just gets madder by the day, Ron, *McGonagall said with a smile. I do insist you call me Minerva, as I fervently hope to never again be your professor.
Snape: If only Potter were as easily gotten rid of, *Snape quipped without any real heat to his words. Harry rolled his eyes and took a long drink of his wine. You know me, Severus, Iâ€™m hard to shake. Likeâ€¦
Snape: A fatal plague? *Snape suggested.*
Hermione: Oh, look, thereâ€™s Neville, *Hermione said, interrupting what she thought was (maybe?) a brewing argument between the two men. Neville! *Hermione waved at their friend who just entered the Great Hall.*
Neville: Hermione, Ron, how are you? *he asked as he took the seat between Sprout and Harry.*
Ron: Wonderful, *Ron grinned. He stretched his arm over the back of Hermioneâ€™s chair. Howâ€™s your apprenticeship?*
Sprout: Neville is doing splendidly, *Sprout said with a proud and motherly smile for Neville that caused him to blush a little. Iâ€™d say heâ€™s becoming quite close to being a true expert in his field.*
Snape: Oh? *Snape looked blandly over at McGonagall Minerva. Do we hire experts in their fields now? I thought perhaps you merely accepted the application for any riffraff who seeks employment.*
Harry: *Since Hermione was pretty sure that was another unfair jab at Harry, she wasnâ€™t sure why Harry snorted.* Is that how you got the job? *Harry asked him with a perfect face of innocence. I always wondered since you canâ€™t teach worth a damn.*"
4,40010886,Harry,Snape,"Harry: I want to talk to you, *snorted* Is that how you got the job?
Snape: I am a potions master, Potter, *snickered* You are a dunderhead with magical levels of luck.
Harry: I killed Voldemort, *took another drink of his wine* And I was the youngest auror in Ministry history to pass the field tests on the first try.
Snape: You got a lucky shot with an expelliarmus and were hired due to your fame, *said* No true talent to be had, Potter.
Harry: Let's duel then, *offered quickly* Revive the old dueling club, eh? See if I've got any talent or not.
Snape: And embarrass you in front of your students more than you do on your own? I think not.
Minerva: I think it's a great idea, *said* The students would really benefit by both of your expertise.
Harry: Lupin, *said immediately* Then Barty Crouch Junior, then Umbridge, then Quirrell, then Lockhart, and then you, *smiled charmingly* sir.
Snape: How in Merlin's name, did you come to rank me beneath the Ministry toad? *demanded*
Harry: She eventually managed to teach me something you never did, Severus, *drawled* the benefits of shutting my mouth on occasion.
Hermione: And also to never insult centaurs, *added in a whisper*
Snape: *laughed* Well, you wouldn't be the man you are today if you knew when to hold your tongue, would you?
Harry: And you wouldn't be the bastard you are today if you knew how to compliment someone properly, *winked*"
5,40010886,Harry,Snape,"Harry: And you wouldn't be the bastard you are today if you knew how to compliment someone properly, *he winked.*
Snape: Indeed, *he said calmly before taking a sip.*
Harry: Bit warm in here, isn't it? *he asked as he rolled up his shirt sleeves and propped his elbows on the table.*
Harry: What's wrong, Severus? Am I out of the dress code that you've decided to enforce on Christmas?
Snape: Mister Weasley, how is your auror training? *he asked, apropos of nothing.*
Ron: Er... alright, I guess. I'm not failing anyways.
Snape: Excellent. Ten points to Gryffindor then. Goodnight.
Harry: Hey, Minerva?
Minerva: Yes, Harry?
Harry: Eleven points to S-Slytherin for hiring me.
Minerva: Oh, Mister Potter. Let's get you to bed so you don't end up in the wrong one tonight, hmm?
Hermione: What on earth was that?
Sprout: But Severus is a Slytherin.
Ron: Did Snape really give me ten points? I'm not even a student!
Neville: Yeah, but Harry's the head of Gryffindor, isn't he?
Hermione: Oh! They were flirting!
Ron: Harry was not flirting with Snape."
6,40010886,Harry,Snape,"Ron: Harry was not flirting with Snape, *laughed so loudly*
Hermione: And they were, I'm certain of it. That's why they were... um... giving each other's house points? *pointed out*
Ron: I think they're just tired of fighting and they're mates now, or something. Makes sense; Harry's a cheeky prat and Snape's a witty bastard. They probably just like to joke around. *snorted and tightened his arm around Hermione's waist*
Hermione: *hummed and let Ron lead them to their room* Well I think that Molly should have an extra jumper on standby for next Christmas. A black one, obviously.

Severus: Are your robes new? *asked Potter casually*
Harry: *hand twitched as he poured his tea* Er... No?
Severus: *hummed* They look nice, Potter. Three points to Gryffindor.
Harry: *stiffened and turned a surprised look toward Severus before he slowly smiled* Thanks.

Severus: *nodded and returned to the paper he had been reading* Theory tested, theory proven. He made the first move, it was up to Potter to decide how the game went from there.

Harry: *wandering the empty corridors* Technically, he was 'patrolling', but since it wasn't his scheduled night, he preferred to think of it as haunting.
Harry: *loved Hogwarts at night* He always had, truthfully. He loved the way the magic seemed stronger, the walls seemed sturdier, and possibilities seemed endless.
Harry: *breathed in the magic and exhaled his problems* It really was a gift that Minerva offered him the job."
7,40010886,Harry,Snape,"Harry: Evening, *with a joyful smile creeping up on his face*
Snape: Wandering the corridors past curfew again? *clicked his tongue as he silently moved to stand beside Harry in the alcove overlooking the grounds*
Harry: You know me, Severus, dim as a doorknob.
Snape: Hmm, and yet bright enough to have his OWL and NEWT students earn one of the highest pass rates in the last ten years at Hogwarts.
Harry: What? *Harry’s head turned from the lake to Snape so quickly that he felt a muscle twinge in protest.* How- who- really?
Snape: *smirked* I have a friend who on the examination board. Congratulations, Potter, it seems as if you are not as incompetent a professor as you were student.
Harry: This is great! *Harry was smiling so hard it ached.* So then Minerva can’t even fire me! I can come back again next year!
Snape: *gave Harry a peculiar look* Did you believe that was an option?
Harry: If my students all failed? Yeah, *Harry shrugged.* And here I was worried about what I was going to do next year and all I have to worry about is summer!
Snape: Potter. Minerva sought you out to personally offer you the job, she would not fire you for your first year of teaching resulting in low scores.
Harry: *shrugged again* Moot point now.
Snape: And you are quite welcome to remain in the castle over the summer, if you wish, *Snape said.* Not many professors do, but a few of us choose to stay here.
Harry: *stressed his name in a pointed reminder that he asked the stubborn man to call him Harry* Severus, are you saying that not only can I stay in Hogwarts for the summer, but that you’ll be here to spend time with if I do?"
8,40010886,Harry,Severus,"Harry: Severus, are you saying that not only can I stay in Hogwarts for the summer, but that you'll be here to spend time with if I do?
Severus: I believe that was the implication, Mister Potter.
Severus: Goodnight, Potter.
Harry: Twenty points to Slytherin.

Minerva: Before we begin the feast, I would like to announce a small change to our staff this year.
Harry: I told you we were late, Severus.
Severus: And I told you, Harry, that we should have skipped the feast altogether.
Minerva: As I was saying, Professor's Snape and Potter will no longer be teaching potions and defense. Instead, I am pleased to inform you that Professor Severus Snape-Potter will be teaching potions and Professor Harry Snape-Potter will be teaching defense against the dark arts.

Minerva: In order to keep the point system from decimating into chaos as it did last year, Professors Snape-Potter will not be allowed to dock points from each other's houses.
Minerva: Whoever had their money on the two of them getting together on the last day of term should report to my office before classes tomorrow for your betting winnings of two hundred and seven galleons, eighteen sickles, and three knuts."
