0,4358156,Lily,James,"Lily: ‘Your sister implied you couldn’t get a boyfriend, and so you lied and said you already have one?’
James: ‘Okay, but you don’t have a boyfriend?’
Lily: ‘You know I don’t—’
James: ‘And you deliberately lead her to believe that you do have a boyfriend?’
Lily: ‘I mean, yes. But—’
James: ‘Fine,’ Lily sighed. ‘Fine, fine, fine. I lied. I’m a big fat liar. But you should have seen the smug look on her face-’
James: ‘Oh, you don’t have to defend yourself to me, Lils. I consider it a bad day if I haven’t squeezed in at least four good lies before breakfast.’
Lily: ‘I don’t doubt it,’ she huffed, not looking particularly comforted.
James: ‘And now you have to go to her wedding, and she’s expecting you to bring Mystery Man?’
Lily: ‘Yup.’
James: ‘And you’re asking me to go with you?’
Lily: ‘Looks like I am, yeah.’
James: ‘So,’ he said, tilting his head in a manner that reminded her frustratingly of a kitten. ‘Why me, eh?’
Lily: ‘You’re my friend! I assumed you would have my back in my time of need!’
James: ‘I suppose the reason you’re asking me and not, say, Sirius, or Remus, or young Pete, would be my dashing good looks? My superior charm? My—’
Lily: ‘Peter is too innocent to drag into all of this,’ she said, counting off on her fingers. ‘Remus has too much dignity. Sirius is too unpredictable. I mean—so are you—but you’re the lesser of two evils, I suppose.’
James: ‘So why me?’ he asked, propping his chin up on his elbows and waggling his eyebrows suggestively.
Lily: ‘Because,’ Lily braced herself, knowing she was going to regret what she said next, but seeing no way out of it. ‘Petunia may have asked what this ‘boyfriend’ of mine looked like, and I may have given her a few physical descriptions. General stuff, of course. And some of those descriptions may, or may not, have kind of, sort of—’
James: ‘Oh my god. You described me. You described me, didn’t you, Evans?’
Lily: ‘Yes.’ Her voice was barely above a whisper.
James: ‘So what did you say? Effortlessly tousled hair—’
Lily: ‘Dirty great mop on top of his head—’
James: ‘Tall, bronzed, quidditch-toned body—’
Lily: ‘Lanky, gangly git—’
Lily: ‘So, you’ll do it then?’
James: ‘Naturally. I’m not entirely sure what a tux is, but I’m sure I’"
1,4358156,Lily,James,"Lily: ‘So, you’ll do it then?’
James: ‘Naturally. I’m not entirely sure what a tux is, but I’m sure I’ll look great in one.’
Lily: ‘Lils.’
James: ‘James.’
Lily: ‘No magic talk, okay? If Tuney overhears us talking about the M-word on her special day, she’ll probably have an aneurysm.’
James: ‘Fine, fine— No magic talk. Got it. But… the cake?’
Lily: ‘Yes, James, Muggles have cake.’
Lily's mother: ‘And you must be James.’
James: ‘Pleasure to meet you, Mrs Evans.’
Lily's mother: ‘What exactly are your intentions with my daughter?’
James: *sputtered*"
2,4358156,Lily,James,"Lily: Now. Might as well get this out of the way. What exactly are your intentions with my daughter?
James: *sputtered, clearly thrown off*
Lily: *rolled her eyes at her mother’s oh-so-predictable antics* Oh, I’m just messing with you, sweetie. Now, if you’ll excuse me, I just have so much to do. Weddings, I tell you. Could you two please do me a favour and elope to Vegas or somewhere if you want to get hitched? *gave James one last approving pat on the shoulder and disappeared into the living room, yelling for Petunia*
Lily: Well, that’s Mum.
James: *let out a low whistle* That’s one down. I reckon she bought it. Just Petunia and your father to go.
Lily: Oh, Dad’s easy. Just tell him you liked the marigolds in the back garden and he’ll be putty in your hands.
James: Right. Marigolds. Got it.
Lily: Petunia will hate you on principle, but there’s nothing to be done about that.
James: *sighed dramatically* Oh, Petunia, the true object of my desires, light of my life, fire of my loins. Is there nothing I can do to win her favour?
Lily: I’m afraid it is the classic tale of unrequited love. You will receive nought but heartbreak.
Lily: *cut him off with a quick kick to the shin before slipping her hand into his*
Petunia: Lily, what are you doing with those freesias? Those should be in the car. Oh, the pink to white ratio is all wrong. Nothing to be done about it now, would you just…get them into the car already! Oh. You must be James. *added as an afterthought*
James: *in a strained sort of voice* Lovely to meet you. You look, uh, dashing.
Lily: *had to bite the inside of her cheek to stop herself from laughing*
Petunia: *looked James over*"
3,4358156,Lily,James,"Lily: ‘So,’ said James in the back seat of the car, leaning down to whisper conspiratorially into Lily’s ear. ‘What angle are we going for? Perfect guests or unruly wedding crashers? Are we to sit quietly and compliment the salmon, or are we gonna get smashed on Muggle booze and take it in turns to try and seduce the best man?’
James: Lily laughed and shook her head. ‘As tempting as that second option sounds, I’m not going to ruin her big day.’
James: ‘I know. I’m just kidding,’ nodded James, smiling. ‘I don’t know how you have the patience, though, thank the Lord I’m the only child. I wouldn’t have the temperament. Sharing things? Not being the sole centre of my parents’ attentions? I dread to think!’
Lily: ‘Not everybody gets dealt such a shitty hand, sibling-wise, you know.’
James: James didn’t look convinced. ‘Yeah, well, you have dear old Tuney up there, Sirius has Reg—I reckon I’m better off with Sirius.’
Lily: Lily nodded fairly. He had never talked to her about Sirius’s brother before, and she didn’t want to push the topic, knowing that Sirius preferred to stay pretty quiet about the whole thing.
Lily: ‘Siblings aren’t all bad though. Before…before I knew I was a W-I-T-C-H, we were close. It’s nice to be able to share everything with someone. To know, well, to think that somebody has your back no matter what.’
James: ‘Yeah well, I have my mates for that. And so do you.’ James tentatively placed his own hand on top of hers and squeezed gently. She smiled up at him.
Lily: ‘Yeah. I do.’
Lily: After a while, however, Lily began to sidle closer to him, holding his hand and fluttering her eyelashes dramatically, calling him things like ‘sweetie-pie’ and ‘sugar-dumpling.’ James did his best to stifle his laughter when she booped his nose, cooing at him sickeningly in front of a gaudily-dressed great aunt. He played along: brushing her hair out of her eyes calling her his ‘pooky bear.’
Lily: And because it was them, things eventually took on a competitive edge. Lily looked an uncle straight in the face and introduced James as her ‘Slice Of Man Pie.’ When James sauntered over to one of Lily’s distant cousins and asked her how she was related to his ‘Pwecious Lilykins’, Lily was torn between laughing and hitting him."
4,4358156,Lily,James,"Lily: When James sauntered over to one of Lily’s distant cousins and asked her how she was related to his ‘Pwecious Lilykins’, Lily was torn between laughing and hitting him. *Lily was torn between laughing and hitting him.*
James: Ah—this is what true marriage should be: one woman and one walrus. *James caught his first glimpse of Vernon Dursley. He was purple in the face, barging around barking orders at people.*
Lily: As it had just started to quiet down, the comment made Lily snort with laughter loud enough to gain several dirty looks from the people seated around them. ‘Shhh—’ she managed to whisper through giggles, ‘It’s starting.’ They managed to sit through the first five minutes in silence, barely able to hear what was going on from their spot at the back, but eventually boredom took over. James started making farting noises quietly enough for only Lily to hear every time Vernon spoke. She pressed her lips together and shook her head, secretly grateful that she wasn’t having to suffer through this alone.
Lily: Lily had to admit that Petunia had picked a beautiful location, and a gorgeous day: afternoon sun filtered down through the breezy air, which was filled with the perfumed scent of flowers.
Lily: Everybody was busy bustling up to Petunia and Vernon to offer their congratulations and luck, so Lily stood off to one side and waited until the crowd had died down, and until Vernon was off somewhere attending to some family members. She edged up to her sister and smiled hesitantly.
Petunia: What did you think of the ceremony? *Petunia asked her formally.*
Lily: It was—it was beautiful, Petunia. Congratulations. *replied Lily, trying not to think of farting sounds coming from her sister’s husband every time he opened his mouth.*
Petunia: Thank you. *her sister’s reply was cool as she turned to disappear back into the crowd.*
Lily: ‘Tuney—’ Lily’s hand sprang out to grab her sister’s shoulder almost involuntarily. At the touch, Petunia turned around, eyeing her suspiciously.
Lily: I’m really happy for you. Truly,’ said Lily as genuinely as she could. ‘I hope you’re very happy.’
Petunia: Thank you, Lily. *Her eyes darted quickly to James, and then back to her sister. ‘You too.’*
Lily: At dinner, Lily and James found themselves seated with Lily's grandmother and an assortment of her (impressively) already drunk aunts. They ate an almost endless stream of tiny dishes—slices of Palma ham and fresh melon, figs with a pale pink salmon mousse, stuffed Portobello mushrooms, poached quails eggs, and half a dozen other things which neither of them could identify, but tasted delicious nonetheless. The courses were accompanied by glasses of sweet, bubbly champagne that had both of their cheeks flushed pink by the third glass. Lily’s gran had taken to James, and she kept pinching his cheeks and asking him to recount stories of detentions he had earned.
James: He did so happily, going into great detail and adding a few embellishments that Lily was pretty sure were made up. He also made sure to gloss over the parts involving magic, which Lily was thankful for.
Lily's grandmother: Oh ho! You didn’t? Frogspawn? In his bed?’
James: All over it,’ grinned James, leaning back in his chair. ‘He smelt like a pond for a week, the pompous git.’
Lily's grandmother: This one’s a keeper, Lily.
Lily: Oh, don’t I know it? *and leant forward to peck him on the cheek.*
James: *James looked at her, his mouth dropping into...*"
5,4358156,Lily,James,"Lily: ‘I’m really glad you asked me to be your fake-boyfriend, Evans.’
James: ‘So am I,’ replied Lily, grinning and looking up at him through her lashes. ‘Best fake-date I’ve ever been on.’
Lily: ‘You know…’ she whispered, the fuzziness in her head making her brave. ‘You could fake-kiss me…if you like.’
James: 'And yet, the offer still stands.’
James: ‘Sneaking away... from your sister’s wedding... for a snog...’ said James breathlessly between kisses. ‘Classy, Evans—’ She shut him up by kissing him harder, knocking his glasses askew and tangling her hands in his hair.
Lily: ‘Psh ...’ she muttered as his lips moved to her neck. ‘This is what weddings were invented for.’
Lily: ‘James?’
James: ‘Hm?’
Lily: ‘Not that you haven’t been a fantastic fake-boyfriend and all, but d’fancy maybe dropping the ‘fake’ part?’
James: James smiled at her like they were both in on the world’s biggest secret, and she beamed back, glowing like the sun. ‘Yeah. I reckon I do.’"
