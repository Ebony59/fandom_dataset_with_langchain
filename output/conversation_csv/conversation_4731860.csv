0,4731860,Draco,McGonagall,"Draco: Well, this is a surprise, *Draco stared back at McGonagall*
McGonagall: Mister Malfoy, since you have been the one with the most adamant response so far, why don't you help me to understand what's in the idea of a pet that you all find so detestable?
Draco: Headmistress, none of the other years is allowed to have that kind of pet. In fact, in the letters that get sent every year, it’s specified very clearly that only owls, cats and toads are allowed. This could be viewed as favouritism.
McGonagall: This is an attempt at interhouse cooperation, Mister Malfoy. I assure you, yours isn't the only year I'm using a special technique on. In the end, everything should lead to a good relationship between houses.
Potter: But we're already leading for interhouse cooperation, professor. I mean, Headmistress, *Potter spoke up*
Draco: *Draco nodded in acknowledgment* We're all going to share the same room and everything.
Granger: Professor McGonagall! Headmistress! *Granger jumped in*
Weasley: It's true, profess- Headmistress! *Weasley said, quite frantic himself*
Longbottom: Don't worry, Ron, Trevor is a survivor. He might even be friends with the parrot.
Blaise: Then you know nothing about biology."
1,4731860,Blaise,Longbottom,"Blaise: Longbottom, if you think a toad can befriend a parrot, then you are… Then you know nothing about biology.
Draco: *sent him a warning look*
Blaise: Mister Longbottom, Mister Zabini, Would it be too much of an inconvenience to go back to the topic at discussion? I hope this little scene was enough to remind yourselves why we need interhouse bonding.
Headmistress: Miss Granger, I assure you this parrot is greatly adapted to our climate and won't need any special care, not besides what you'd do for a mail owl.
Draco: A parrot is a noisy animal. We have to get our NEWTs this year; this is why we're here again, after all. We won't be able to concentrate if the parrot is feeling chatty.
Headmistress: Mister Malfoy, I assure you the parrot will not bother you. As I said before, it'll be here for nothing else but to help.
Blaise: So, what do you guys want to do on the first night, hmm? Are we going to play riddles in a pure Ravenclaw fashion, or maybe follow the Hufflepuff tradition of going 'round the room giving a hug and a kiss to everybody? Oh, no, wait, better, we can honour our dear Gryffindor companions by having a group wank party!
Seamus Finnigan: Shut up, Zabini."
2,4731860,Draco,Greg,"Draco: Are we having a pet?
Greg: Apparently.
Draco: We'd better go to sleep, Greg.
...
Draco: *starts walking away*
...
Draco: *turns his head towards Potter*
Potter: *smiles at Draco and mouths something*
Draco: *nods curtly with a grim face*
...
Weasley: Yeah, good night, Malfoy. Keep an eye open, though: today we're following the Slytherins' tradition of hexing people in their sleep!
...
Draco: *didn't have a good night at all*
...
Draco: Assuming Potter had wished him well out of the pure goodness of his heart, which he believed was unlikely, there was still the issue of why he'd chosen to do that, to inadvertently forgive him that way.
...
Draco: Also, having to sleep in a room full of people who distrusted him (that, at best) wasn't helpful.
...
Draco: He spent the whole night focusing on Greg's snoring across the room and Blaise's quiet mumbling, reassuring sounds he'd come to know in the past years, so he wouldn't accidentally achieve the level of familiarity with Potter and the Weasel that came from knowing people's habits while they slept.
...
Draco: He especially didn't want to know if Potter had nightmares from the war, or if any of them involved him and that night in Myrtle's bathroom."
3,4731860,Draco,Blaise,"Draco: So the thing has already blessed us with its presence.
Blaise: *chuckles and sits next to Draco*
Greg: *quickly follows Blaise*
Longbottom: The parrot, Nev.
Potter: Ah, you mean Robert!
Blaise: *laughs loudly* Robert. Who the hell names a parrot Robert?
Draco: Longbottom, apparently."
4,4731860,Blaise,Robert,"Blaise: Ah, you mean Robert!
Draco: Longbottom, apparently.
Weasley: I can't fucking believe it. Being here trapped with Slytherins? Fine. Having to take care of a beast that will probably bite our fingers off when we try to feed it? Okay. But McGonagall bringing in a parrot in the bloody Slytherins' colours? No chance, mate, no fucking chance!
Granger: Is it there where you draw the line? At the parrot being green?
Finnigan: It's like McGonagall is doing this to spite us.
Draco: Of course McGonagall did this on purpose, Finnigan. I'm sure she's transfigured and hiding somewhere in the room just to watch you all flipping your shite. To have a good laugh, you know? That's what I would do, anyway.
Blaise: I wouldn't. Setting you on edge is just too fucking easy, it's not even funny anymore.
Finnigan: What isn't funny is having you here, Zabini.
Draco: Why, do my Slytherin colours offend your delicate sensibilities?
Weasley: Only because Slytherin colours go hand in hand with Slytherin tossers!"
5,4731860,Draco,Blaise,"Draco: Blaise, enough, *slowly rising from his seat* If you like your bloody red so much-
Blaise: Blaise! *a panicked voice interrupted* Blaise, stop it.
Weasley: No, Zabini, we're all dying to hear what you were about to say.
Granger: Seamus! *yelled, seemingly horrified*
Weasley: This has gone too far, Hermione! *screamed back, his skin as dark as his hair by then* Zabini, are you going to chicken out now, you bloody coward?!
Draco: Ron!
Potter: Malfoy, *said out loud, startling him*"
6,4731860,Draco,Potter,"Draco: Potter, he replied warily.
Potter: The idiot then smiled as if Draco had done something great and took a few steps towards him. Take off your tie.
Draco: Tilting his head up in a challenge Potter was bound to recognize, he began to nimbly undo his tie.
Potter: Finally Potter looked up again and grinned at him, at him, before closing the few steps that still separated them.
Draco: Everybody was too quiet for them to talk without anybody hearing, so Draco had to substitute a heavily charged question with a raised brow. It worked just as well.
Potter: Potter kept smiling confidently and then did the most unexpected thing he'd ever seen him doing: putting his own Gryffindor red tie around Draco's neck, and instead of choking him with it, starting to tie it.
Draco: He had to fight with himself to raise his arms ever so slightly and wrap the tie around Potter's neck, and his hands were trembling as he tied it.
Potter: The worst part was, he was sure Potter could feel it, and yet he let his hands fall and patiently waited until Draco was finished, giving him a nod and managing to almost successfully hide the curious spark that was alight in his eyes.
Potter: Well, Potter spoke, turning towards Weasley and Finnigan, do I look like a Slytherin tosser to you? After leaving everybody gaping, he beamed and added, I hope not, I find I quite like green.
Draco: This is the first time I've heard you saying something sensible, Potter. Red isn't too bad either, don't you think so, Blaise?"
7,4731860,Draco,Potter,"Draco: This is the first time I've heard you saying something sensible, Potter. Red isn't too bad either, don't you think so, Blaise?
Blaise: Err... if it suits you, Draco, it can't be too bad, indeed.

Draco: I was saving your arse, he spat back, but felt his cheeks growing hot anyway. Everybody's arse, actually.
Pansy: Draco? she whispered gingerly. You... you're wearing Potter's tie.

Draco: I was just saving your arse, he insisted anyway, and almost jumped in start when she began untying the red tie. For the love of Merlin, what are you doing?
Pansy: I know you'd love to keep it, dear, but I'm not about to allow you walking around with a Gryffindor tie, Pansy tsked, giving it back to him when she finished. Think about this, you have to maintain your dignity for me, since I can't maintain mine.

Pansy: I'd ask which one of them, but I'm talking about your problem here, Draco. You looked awfully cosy with Potter, and that was a damn weird scene you two pulled. I could feel the sexual tension, and trust me, everybody else could too.
Draco: There was no sexual tension, Pansy! he screamed, horrified at the mere idea. His chest was suddenly too tight, and it got worse as he thought it over and realized that yes, there had been a tiny weeny of sexual tension, at least from his part. He had known it was too intimate, but he had let it slip, too concerned with preventing the Slytherins from getting expelled or sent to Azkaban. I'll say it once more: I was saving your sorry arse, and Potter decided to play along.

Pansy: Fine, if you say so, Pansy snorted. But why?
Draco: Hell if I know! Draco ran his hands through his hair in exasperation, messing it in a way that would make him very irritated with himself in a while, when he could think reasonably again. He did something bloody weird, okay, but it worked, because damn everything he does always work, no matter how stupid. I don't know why he helped, just like I don't know why he spoke in our trials. He..."
8,4731860,Draco,Potter,"Draco: But why?
Draco: He did something bloody weird, okay, but it worked, because damn everything he does always work, no matter how stupid. I don't know why he helped, just like I don't know why he spoke in our trials. He doesn't make any bloody sense.
Pansy: Well, we already knew that. And at least I want to know why he's done it, but it's impossible with Granger and Weasley around him all the time, so it'll be you who has to ask. He does seem to sneak away a lot, and I'm pretty sure you always end up in the same room he is when that happens. She raised a brow, mocking, Isn't it convenient?
Draco: *stares at her for a few moments, and then turns away and mumbles a weak Fuck off, Pansy.*
Draco: He didn't know where to go, but he knew he didn't want to be near his friend in that moment; near any of his friends, actually. They would just nag him about Potter, or nag him about the tie, or nag him about something else, and right then he just wanted to breathe. And yet he would take anyone's company over Pansy's, even the parrot's; at least the bloody thing would shut up and leave him alone, judging by how it had behaved during the fight.
Draco: In fact, the damn parrot had been the only living being in the room that hadn't uttered a single word, being downright indifferent about the whole scene. Draco could just take a liking to it.
Draco: A month into classes, and Draco was ready to walk right into the Whomping Willow and take a hard blow to the face, heir responsibilities be damned.
Draco: Worse, every time Draco saw a Gryffindor and a Slytherin talking in a friendly way, a shiver ran down his spine. It was especially odd when Pansy, who had managed to make the Golden Trio notice her, walked into a room by Granger's side, chatting about homework or whatever floated their boats; Draco had been too spooked to listen.
Draco: And yet he still hadn't talked with Potter.
Draco: Not about what had happened, anyway, not about his reasons for helping them. And especially not about his sudden niceness, that had continued as the days went by and only seemed to serve to spoil Draco and drive everyone else up the wall (Pansy was delighted, though, and often remarked about the special treatment he received, for Potter was always nicer towards Draco than with any other Slytherin).
Draco: Hadn't he been so adamant on denying it to himself, Draco would have claimed he feared that behaviour would stop if he called Potter out on it. But he couldn't slack any longer, or Pansy would murder him; she had gotten the ridiculous idea that he was smitten with Potter and wouldn't let it be, going as far as threatening him with sending a love letter signed with his name if Draco didn't at least try to befriend him.
Draco: Well, he had already tried that once and look how it had paid off! No, cornering Potter to ask him about his motives would be enough."
9,4731860,Draco,Malfoy,"Draco: Malfoy, Granger greeted, taking him by surprise. If you are looking for A Comprehensive Recap of History of Magic, don't bother, I think Neville has the last one. But Professor Binns said there's another book that might be useful if-
Potter: I'll see you in a while, he offered.
Weasley: Mate, we have things to study...
Granger: Ron, seriously, Potter sighed. You're the only one who needs to study for Muggle Studies, 'Mione and I were raised as muggles, remember?
Draco: I don't have all day, Potter, he added, for good measure.
Potter: *turned his back to his friends and stared at him, half smiling.*
Draco: Malfoy? Potter shifted his weight from one foot to another, restless. What is it? I mean, I already gave you your wand...
Draco: Are you afraid I'm going to hex you with it? Draco snorted, before he could help himself. Potter, as much as I hate it, I already owe you a life debt, apart from this personal one."
10,4731860,Potter,Malfoy,"Potter: Malfoy? What is it? I mean, I already gave you your wand...
Draco: Are you afraid I'm going to hex you with it? Potter, as much as I hate it, I already owe you a life debt, apart from this personal one. I doubt my wand would let me hurt you; magic doesn't work that way.
Potter: You mean you can't hurt me because you have a life debt with me? But you already paid it. You saved my life.
Draco: Potter, if I helped you, it was only indirectly. Not handing you in on a silver plate is not the same as saving your life. Magic knows that; you owe me nothing.
Potter: Well, magic might not recognize what you did, but I do. So thank you.
Draco: Potter, did somebody drop you on your head when you were a child? I'm giving you the perfect way out, just fucking take it. You don't have to pretend you give a shite about Slytherins anymore; again, you owe us nothing. Especially not me. You don't have to strain yourself being nice. Honestly, Potter, I'd have thought-
Potter: So that was what it was all about! Malfoy, I wasn't... I wasn't trying to pay off a life debt or whatever. I intervened last month because I didn't want things to escalate, for the same reasons you didn't either. Look, I was in the trials, I know what would have happened. And I don't want anyone to be thrown into Azkaban.
Draco: How so?
Potter: Dumbledore never failed to remind me how there were human beings with a story behind every terrible act. He wanted all of us to give everyone a second chance.
Draco: Did he say that before or after I tried to kill him?
Potter: He knew what would happen, you know. He knew what they would have you to do, and he also knew you wouldn't do it. He planned it with Severus, so he would fulfil your task and you wouldn't be punished."
11,4731860,Draco,Potter,"Draco: He knew what would happen, you know. He knew what they would have you to do, and he also knew you wouldn't do it. He planned it with Severus, so he would fulfil your task and you wouldn't be punished.
Potter: Some people just can't stop being heroes.
Draco: Ah, I see the huge typical Gryffindor ego is not lost in you.
Potter: I couldn't be a disappointment to my House. But now that we've solved that, I and my huge Gryffindor ego have to go.
Draco: *fighting the urge to run his fingers over the places where Potter had touched him* See you later.
Potter: See you later, *walks away*
Draco: *doesn't follow him to say goodbye*"
12,4731860,Draco,Pansy,"Draco: Is it juicy gossip?
Pansy: It's not, because you are not allowed to tell anyone. Ever, he insisted, with the most threatening glare he could summon. I'm serious, Pansy.
Draco: Not even Blaise? We have a couple of bets that might-
Draco: Fine, call Blaise, Draco snapped. Who cared if he knew; he would have found out eventually either way. Maybe if he told everyone at once, Pansy would stand for him. Maybe. And Greg, too, he added, as an afterthought. I'll see you in the boys' dorms. I doubt there's anyone there.
Pansy: Well, Finnigan might be wanking, Pansy suggested, grinning mischievously. But again, he might not. Thomas left a while ago and I'm pretty sure those two go at it together.
Blaise: Merlin's pants, Draco, this will better be good, Blaise groaned, menacing, as he sat on Draco's bed. There's a bloody gorgeous Ravenclaw girl I've just left hanging for you, you poncy prat.
Draco: Where were you? he asked Greg, puzzled when he blushed down to his neck.
Pansy: He was with Luna Lovegood, Pansy helpfully supplied, smirking. And that would have been delightful to discuss any other day, don't get me wrong, dear, but I bet what you have to say is much more interesting.
Draco: I think... he cleared his throat, feeling a bit like Greg when he talked about Lovegood, and clenched his fists. “I think I'm a little bit-
Blaise: Gay? Blaise suggested, snorting. That's old news, Draco.
Draco: Not that, he hissed, glaring at him. As I was trying to say, he continued, now more sure (if only because of the annoyance), I think I might like Potter. And not... in a friendly way.
Draco: What the fuck is your problem?! he screamed, after regaining the control of his jaw.
Pansy: Oh, Draco, Pansy chuckled, still trying to get a hold of herself, and pressed her lips tightly together with a shake of her head. You're adorable.
Draco: What? he whispered, finally settling for panic tinted with shame."
13,4731860,Draco,Pansy,"Draco: What the fuck is your problem?! *he screamed, after regaining the control of his jaw.*
Pansy: Oh, Draco, *she chuckled, still trying to get a hold of herself, and pressed her lips tightly together with a shake of her head.* You're adorable.
Draco: What? *he whispered, finally settling for panic tinted with shame.*
Blaise: Do you really think we didn't know? *he finally managed to speak, a grin plastered on his stupid face.* Any more obvious, and Potter himself would have noticed.
Draco: More like a First year with a crush, *Blaise observed, and won himself a pointy elbow in the ribs for the trouble.* Bloody shite! It's the truth, Draco, *he huffed.*
Pansy: Potter hasn't been such a jerk lately, *she crooned in a really bad imitation of Draco's voice.*
Blaise: He let me borrow a quill today.
Pansy: He said sorry when he tripped over me, and didn't take the apology back when he saw who I was.
Draco: I didn't...! I never! *he cried out, his face no doubt ragingly red by then, and tried to remember a time when he had hated his friends so much as he hated them at that moment (he drew a blank).* Fuck you.
Pansy: Oh, dear, you're so smitten, *she mumbled, falling into step beside him.*
Draco: Potter was a bloody twat, Draco decided a week after, glancing sideways at him as they walked side by side. Even if he did have some good qualities.
Potter: What are you thinking? *Potter suddenly asked, seemingly amused, and Draco couldn't help but snort.*
Draco: I'm thinking that your worshipers do a poor job of protecting you, *he smirked, if you managed to slip away unnoticed again and be held against your will by a big, mean Slytherin.*
Potter: The big, mean Slytherin that is barely an inch taller than me, and whom I could beat in a duel with my eyes closed?
Draco: Is that a challenge, Potter? *Draco raised a brow and tried not to smile back.* Because I feel obligated to remind you that you can't even give five steps without your glasses. As amusing as it would be to watch you making a fool of yourself, I'll have to warn you that duelling with your eyes closed might not be a good idea."
14,4731860,Draco,Potter,"Draco: Is that a challenge, Potter? Because I feel obligated to remind you that you can't even give five steps without your glasses. As amusing as it would be to watch you making a fool of yourself, I'll have to warn you that duelling with your eyes closed might not be a good idea.
Potter: Seriously, Malfoy. So, what were you reflecting on so hard? For real.
Draco: Longbottom. My secret crush on Longbottom.
Potter: Yeah, good luck with that. For how he becomes jelly when Ginny passes by, I'm positive you have some competition there.
Draco: I'd say is him the one with the competition, since She-Weasley is the apple of your eyes.
Potter: I'm not dating Ginny anymore, Malfoy. I'm surprised you missed it, considering we haven't talked at all in weeks. And you would know, because I've spent most of that time around you.
Draco: I can reassure you on that, Potter: it's not on purpose. As if I'd give a damn about your girlfriends.
Draco: I was thinking about Longbottom and his obsession about that bloody thing that is occupying space at the dorms.
Potter: Parrot, Malfoy. Come on, I know you can say it.
Draco: I will not. Parrots are supposed to talk, aren't they? And that thing is so bloody useless it doesn't even do that, so it doesn't deserve the name.
Draco: I mean, if the thing talked, at least it would interrupt Longbottom from time to time. As it is now, we have to listen to his endless chatter."
15,4731860,Draco,Potter,"Draco: I mean, if the thing talked, at least it would interrupt Longbottom from time to time. As it is now, we have to listen to his endless chatter. When I say he's obsessed, I mean he is obsessed. He rants to the bloody thing, for Merlin's beard!
Potter: ...not worse than Ron. In case you haven't seen him, he can hold two-hours monologues with his Potions' book. You'll know when he's trying to study because he'll be yelling at it and cursing colourfully. Potter smiled with fondness.
Draco: Honestly, if you're trying to tell me Longbottom is not nutters by putting the Weasel as an example...
Potter: His name is Ron, Malfoy, Potter snapped, frowning at him.
Draco: And Draco is mine, and I've never heard you using it.
Potter: Since I want to get along with you.
Draco: I'll call him Weasley if you call me Draco.
Potter: That would work. Are you keeping the Potter?
Draco: Only for when you irritate me.
Potter: I'm afraid I'll never be Harry, then.
Draco: You're learning. I'm so proud. Also, because that reminded him of classes and, as shameful as it was, he knew Potter's whole schedule like the palm of his hand, he added, Aren't you supposed to be somewhere else? Like in class, for example?
Potter: Crap. No, wait, that's not possible. If we had class, you would already be there.
Draco: Potter... He blinked, hesitated, and said, Harry. Harry, do you remember that day on the beginning on the term, when McGonagall explained that there were a lot of Gryffindors and Ravenclaws back, but barely any Hufflepuffs or Slytherins?
Potter: Err... yes? Well, it's obvious, in the common room-
Draco: So, if you were listening, how is it that you missed that, despite McGonagall's new politic of interhouse unity, we'd have some classes separated?
Potter: *no response*"
16,4731860,Draco,Harry,"Draco: Err... yes? Well, it's obvious, in the common room-
Harry: So, if you were listening, how is it that you missed that, despite McGonagall's new politic of interhouse unity, we'd have some classes separated?
Draco: You mean...
Draco: I have a free period, Pot- Harry. You, on the other hand, don't. So I suggest you to get going, unless you want to spend your weekend scrubbing floors under Filch's gaze.
Harry: Crap, crap, crap, crap.
Draco: You don't have to run, idiot! It's just Slughorn!
Draco: Where's everybody?
Pansy: Hufflepuffs and Gryffindors are in class, of course, and Ravenclaws are all studying in the library.
Greg: The common room is ours.
Pansy: Draco, dear, you're positively glowing. If I didn't know for sure Gryffindors have classes right now, I'd say you've been talking with Potter.
Blaise: I wouldn't put it past our dear Draco to teach Potter the manners of the Slytherins. The Saviour might have chosen to skip class for him; isn't the thought endearing?
Draco: Weren't you reading? Or looking at the pictures, at least?
Blaise: I was, but I heard Potter's name and knew you wouldn't allow me to study any more. There's a reason why no Slytherin ever mentions him anymore; we just couldn't stand your rants about him for another year.
Draco: Fuck you.
Pansy: So, where have you been?
Draco: I was talking with Pot- Harry.
Pansy: Ohh, it's Harry now. I take the courtship is going well?
Draco: What courtship, you ridiculous woman?"
17,4731860,Pansy,Harry,"Pansy: Ohh, it's Harry now, *clenching a hand around his wrist to drag him towards her*. I take the courtship is going well?
Draco: What courtship, you ridiculous woman? *he hissed, wriggling out of her grip in a rather undignified manner*.
Blaise: Everybody knows already you have the hots for Potter, *dismissing him with a wave of his hand*. I can't understand why you keep denying it.
Draco: I don't have the hots for Potter, *he insisted*.
Greg: Draco, you stare at him like you want to eat him.
Blaise: Well, he has, but I-
Pansy: Draco Lucius Malfoy, I swear, if you insist one more time that you don't want to snog Potter like there's no tomorrow... *There was no need the finish the sentence. Pansy was threatening enough already, and she knew that, for she only gave him a reproachful glare before softening*. Then she smiled with complicity, as if sharing a secret. Because honestly, anyone can see Potter is hotter than Firewhisky.
Draco: I'll give you that, Potter has a damn fine arse.
Blaise: Finally, *groaned, covering his face with his hands*. “He admitted it. I didn’t think I’d live to see this.”
Pansy: I'm just happy for him, *she mumbled, still hiding*.
Draco: Fine, I'm just so incredibly glad he'll have to shut the fuck up now.
Pansy: That's more like it.
Draco: Are you studying? Have you turned into a Ravenclaw when I wasn't looking?
Pansy: No, you twat, *she huffed, not bothering to glance at him*. I lose a lot of hours a day following the Golden Trio, and even more listening to you two complaining. You know I can't get behind, Draco, and not everybody can be as smart as Granger.
Blaise: *let his hands fall from his face*, Draco *took a few steps and sank on the couch*, and Greg *jumped on his seat*; the three of them shared the same astonishment, though, because Pansy Parkinson had just complimented Hermione Granger.
Blaise: Merlin's pants, why does the parrot only ever make a sound when Longbottom is not present?
Pansy: It's better this way, *Pansy was quick to answer*, probably wanting everyone to forget her slip-up. If it showed Longbotton any sign it was listening to him, he would never shut his mouth.
Draco: *was certain everybody in the room heard that and shuddered at the same time*."
18,4731860,Pansy,Draco,"Pansy: It's better this way. If it showed Longbottom any sign it was listening to him, he would never shut his mouth.
Draco: Don't invoke him. I'll start revising for History of Magic in a minute and I'll need quiet.
Pansy: Okay, dear, don't mind me. But if you take too long getting that book, I'll assume you're wanking on Potter's bed.
Blaise: And that would be an accurate guess, I bet.
Draco: No, it wouldn't have been. Truly.
Draco: Why did you have to get me into the conversation? Now I can't sneak away while you're distracted.
Weasley: That was my intention. I suffer, you suffer.
Granger: Merlin's pants, how are we even friends?
Weasley: You know what? I have no idea. You're kind of... my step brother. And I don't like my brothers.
Granger: You like Charlie.
Weasley: Everybody likes Charlie."
19,4731860,Draco,Granger,"Draco: You know what? I have no idea. You're kind of... my step brother. And I don't like my brothers.
Granger: You like Charlie.
Draco: Everybody likes Charlie.
Harry (mouthing): (Charlie?)
Harry (insisting): (Hot dragon rider)
Harry: Anyway, I think this friendship has to end.
Weasley: Malfoy? Really? Continue on that line, and you'll end up saying your favourite Weasley is... Percy.
Harry: You should feel insulted. Percy is... He's a cross between Hermione, Ernie Macmillan, and Zacharias Smith. With the most unpleasant traits of each one of them.
Longbottom: Guys, really.
Finnigan: So really, guys, why do we have to stay inside?
Thomas: Oh, bloody hell, Seamus, shut up!"
20,4731860,Blaise,Weasley,"Blaise: Blaise is kind of funny.
Weasley: What the hell. What the bloody hell!
Blaise: even the parrot knows I'm amazing.
Harry: It was not the parrot.
Pansy: That bloody thing...
Longbottom: His name is Robert.
Granger: Robert is a parrot, after all. Harry is right, in a certain way. It didn't know what it was saying, it just repeated what Ron said the week before.
Weasley: Hermione!
Thomas: She's just saying the truth, Ron.
Blaise: Always a pleasure to entertain, Ronnie.
Weasley: groaned and whined
*****************
Blaise: That's okay, Pans, but could you at least open the bloody door?
Draco: scowled at him
Draco: Pansy, enough is enough-
Pansy: Ah, of course, because you never do that!
Draco: The bloody parrot did the same to Lovegood yesterday"
21,4731860,Draco,Pansy,"Draco: Pansy, enough is enough, he warned. You're blowing this out of proportion-
Pansy: Ah, of course, because you never do that!
Draco: The bloody parrot did the same to Lovegood yesterday and she didn't say a word, he reminded her, snorting. Are you saying Luna Lovegood is more mature than you?
Pansy: Lovegood doesn't give a bloody shite about her public image!
Draco: Pansy, Draco said slowly, softly, like one would talk to a wild animal. Pansy, are you aware everybody already knew that you think Granger is smart?
Blaise: Are you aware everybody already thinks that Granger is smart? Blaise added, chuckling. And you know why? Because she is, there's no way around it.
Draco: True, Draco picked up the thread. We spent most of First year trying to outsmart her, and it was a waste of time. Which means you haven't precisely opened your heart to the whole Eighth year, have you?
Pansy: It's not like is a shameful secret. Really, I couldn't be less impressed if the parrot said Ginny Weasley still has the hots for Potter.
Draco: Pardon me? he asked, startled and, frankly, kind of concerned about her mental health. Even more so after her face shifted and she let out a bark of laughter.
Pansy: Oh, dear. Oh, Draco, she paused to recover her breath, beamed at Blaise, and turned to Draco again. Aren't you worried? Not in the slightest? The parrot could give away your secrets, too.
Draco: Surely, Pansy. Except that I haven't been daft enough to say anything personal in the middle of the common room, where everyone could hear. Including the bloody parrot.
Blaise: Yeah, I see it now. You haven't been very careful, Draco.
Pansy: A few weeks ago, Draco, remember? The"
22,4731860,Draco,Pansy,"Draco: Yeah, I see it now. You haven't been very careful, Draco.
Draco: What are you babbling about?
Pansy: I'll leave the honour to explain to you, Pans.
Pansy: A few weeks ago, Draco, remember? The same day I had the terrible idea to compliment Granger in front of the bloody thing?
Draco: There were only Slytherins in the common room, Blaise couldn't help butting in, smirking. We thought it was safe.
Draco: What were we talking about before Granger, I wonder?
Draco: Spill it, he hissed, even if what he really wanted was to run away screaming.
Pansy: Well, dear, I believe when I complimented Granger, you'd just praised Potter's arse. Quite enthusiastically.
Draco: You're having me on, aren't you?
Blaise: Pansy, I think you should lie now, because if you say no, he might faint, Blaise observed, staring closely at Draco's face. Remember how we used to say he couldn't possibly be paler? Well... looks like all blood has been drained from his face. I've seen tanner albino people.
Draco: You have a plan to kill me? he cried out, appalled. Gryffindors were right, you can't trust a Slytherin.
Pansy: Draco, sooner or later, I'd have schemed something to hook you up with Potter, Pansy explained in soft voice. This has made my job much easier. If the parrot repeats what you said about Potter, and he hears it, he might start asking questions. And even if he doesn't, Granger will. Then they'll discover you're totally smitten with Potter, and you two will only ever be seen again snogging in dark corners of the castle. Problem solved.
Draco: You've lost your mind.
Pansy: Okay, let's do this… she said sweetly, which set off alarm charms all over Draco's mind. If the parrot doesn't say anything about Potter's arse, I'll take it as a signal from fate and I'll leave you alone. No more interventions. You can bury yourself in a cave and not speak with Potter ever again, throttling your poor heart, and I won't say a word.
Draco: Truly?
Blaise: Sounds too good to be true, doesn't it? Blaise snorted, but stepped back at her glare.
Pansy: I promise.
Draco: That fucking haughty little shit!
Greg: Draco, I think you shouldn't speak so loud, Greg pointed out warily. We're in the middle of the corridor and people are staring."
23,4731860,Draco,Greg,"Draco: That fucking haughty little shit!
Greg: Draco, I think you shouldn't speak so loud, Greg pointed out warily. We're in the middle of the corridor and people are staring.
Draco: You don't understand, Greg, he howled. Do you know why I've been so late to dinner? Do you know?
Greg: Erh...
Draco: Because I was in the common room, with the bloody parrot, again, that's why!
Greg: Please, Draco, people are staring, Greg insisted, looking increasingly concerned.
Draco: During the last three days, I've tried fourteen different charms. Fourteen! When I rendered it mute, it burped the charm back at me and I had to ask Blaise to lift it. Two hours of my life lost while I gestured at him and he laughed hysterically without paying me any attention.
Greg: I know that, you told me, he blinked, apparently not getting why Draco was repeating himself.
Draco: When I casted a Muffliato, Draco continued, unperturbed, the fucking parrot said I love Dean's hair with bloody echo.
Greg: Did you just say you love Thomas' hair?
Draco: It wasn't me! Someone said it in front of the parrot, and it blurted it out to me! That's how it works, Greg, in case you haven't been listening at Granger explaining it for the whole week!
Draco: My point is, I'm fucking fed up! He ran a hand through his hair, trembling, and whispered, Guess what happened today, when I tried to cast an Imperius on the bloody thing.
Greg: It didn't work? Greg asked tentatively.
Draco: I give up, Greg, he said, with a deep sigh. I've had enough of this shite. If the bloody parrot hasn't talked yet, it won't do so at all.
Greg: I guess, was all he said, doubtful. You go in, I'm going to the Ravenclaw dorms.
Draco: Ah, you abandon us for Lovegood again, Draco tsked, half smiling, as he walked into the common room.
Harry: Draco! someone called him, and he couldn't quite hold back that surge of warmth that overcame him when he saw Harry.
Draco: Bloody shite, I'm turning into a Hufflepuff.
Draco: Fancy a game, Potter?
Harry: Better..."
24,4731860,Draco,Potter,"Draco: Fancy a game, Potter?
Harry: Better not. I'm pants at chess. Well, at least I think I am; I only ever play with Ron and he kicks everybody's arse, so really, I could have a hidden talent.
Draco: Somehow I doubt it.
Harry: You've never seen me play.
Draco: There's no need.
Harry: Honestly, Draco, you're almost worse as a friend than as an enemy. Although you're a git either way, I'll give you that.
Draco: Pot calling the kettle black.
Harry: Well, anyway... I was half hoping you'd play with Ron, actually. It's not often he's challenged by someone who knows what he's doing. And if he asks me to play one more time, I swear I'll hurt him.
Draco: Harry, what makes you think Weasley would play with me?
Harry: Why wouldn't he?
Draco: For the same reason you don't hang out with my friends.
Harry: Honest fear?
Draco: You're afraid of my friends?
Harry: No, not Blais- Zabini. He's alright. But Parkinson is quite...
Draco: Harmless.
Harry: She stalks us. It's creepy. Even creepier when she starts talking with Hermione about... Hermione-ish things.
Draco: Wait, you're doing it again.
Harry: Getting side-tracked! I'm serious, you know? Ron won't be a twat if you're not. And I'm really sick of losing at chess; wouldn't mind if you kicked his arse, either.
Draco: Fine. If I get him to have a tantrum without you whining about it, it won't be a lost afternoon."
25,4731860,Draco,Potter,"Draco: Potter has a damn fine arse.
Harry: *blushes and looks at Draco helplessly*
Neville: Looks like you have a secret admirer, Harry.
Finnigan: Not fair! Harry already has enough admirers to last a lifetime. Where are mine?
Thomas: You don't have any.
Blaise: Would you shut up, Finnigan? We were trying to discuss who lusts after Potter's arse.
Draco: No, Blaise, I don't think so. In fact, I think we should end the bloody parrot; it has only ever caused problems.
Neville: Don't ever think about it!
Pansy: Aren't you a bit too interested in getting rid of the parrot? I'd say you're-
Hermione: Besides, Malfoy is wrong. The parrot has only ever been useful. I've been doing some research-
Neville: His name is Robert, Hermione.
Hermione: Well, what I'm saying is that the parrot... Robert has probably been charmed by McGonagall to favour interhouse bonding. It would have been much more convenient for it to catch someone badmouthing; Merlin knows there has been a lot of that here. But if you think about it, it has only repeated nice..."
26,4731860,Longbottom,Robert,"Longbottom: His name is Robert, Hermione.
Hermione: Ah, sure, Nev. Well, what I'm saying is that the parrot... Robert has probably been charmed by McGonagall to favour interhouse bonding. It would have been much more convenient for it to catch someone badmouthing; Merlin knows there has been a lot of that here. But if you think about it, it has only repeated nice things someone has said about another person... especially if they were from different houses.
Hufflepuff: And Robert does have a flair for the dramatics! He always waits until the room is quiet and there's the biggest number of people in it to say something.
Harry: *sighs*
Draco: Of course it would wait for the whole Eighth year to be here to make an announcement about me.
Draco: Tough luck, yours.
Pansy: Wait, Granger-
Hermione: Hermione.
Pansy: Hermione, are implying that McGonagall wanted the parrot to let us all know what Draco thinks about Potter's arse?
Draco: That's... that's preposterous! I... I...
Thomas: I'm not surprised.
Hermione: No, Pansy, I don't think that was McGonagall's intention. It's more like... a side benefit.
Draco: *bolts out of the room*"
27,4731860,Draco,Pansy,"Draco: Haven't you done enough, Pansy? You'd do better rescuing Greg from the Ravenclaws. Lovegood has had him for a while, I'd say her time is up.
Unknown person: Ehm... I'm not Pansy.
Draco: Definitely not Pansy, but just as unwelcome.
Harry: Excuse me, should I go back to the common room so you can stare at my arse as I walk away?
Draco: Uh.
Harry: Shite, I'm sorry. I'm sorry, that was... horrible. You just caught me off guard.
Draco: You're not the one who has just been publicly shamed, Potter.
Harry: I'm back to Potter, then?
Draco: It's all for the better, I figured.
Harry: Hermione's been bugging me for weeks, saying it was obvious you were... in love with me.
Draco: Good for her.
Harry: You're doing this on purpose.
Draco: Riling you up? Of course I am. That's what we always do, isn't it?
Harry: Not lately, not since we became friends. Especially not now that you...
Draco: Now that I what, Potter?
Harry: Now that I like your arse? Because there's nothing else there, trust me. I know your ego might shrink if you don't fill your share of people who are madly in love with you, but that's a risk you'd-
Harry: Merlin"
28,4731860,Draco,Harry,"Draco: Now that I like your arse? Because there's nothing else there, trust me, *gestured wildly, his self-control gone.* I know your ego might shrink if you don't fill your share of people who are madly in love with you, but that's a risk you'd-
Harry: Merlin, Draco, shut up! *yelled, gripping his wrists.* Can't you ever make something easy, for once?
Draco: You'd love that, wouldn't you? *he hissed.* You'd love me following you around like Greg does with Lovegood, begging for the scraps of your attention-
Harry: You wouldn't need to beg. *Draco stopped talking and blinked, startled.* You wouldn't need to beg, *he repeated in a firmer tone, eyes locked in his,* I'd give it all to you. I've always had, even when I didn't know why. Maybe a part of me did know, but I chose to ignore it. But the war is over, now, I don't have to-
Draco: Potter. Harry. I don't understand a word you're saying and my wrists kinda hurt, so if you could be so kind to release me...
Harry: I will. In a moment.
Draco: *His first instinct might or might have not been kicking Harry's groin, but that was only the surreality of the situation catching up to him.*
Harry: *There were warm lips against his in a gentle pressure, and Draco couldn't quite believe whose they were; he'd forgotten how it felt when you got what you wanted, and he'd never wanted anything else with such passion.*
Draco: *He was so lost in his astonishment that he almost didn't notice Harry pulling away from him, but he did, and he couldn't allow it, just couldn't, or either they'd never talk about it again (Draco knew himself well enough to be certain) and he'd die slowly and painfully, day by day, because of his own stupidity.* Before he could step away, though, Draco's hands shot forward and tangled on his hair (it wasn't as if it could get any messier, after all).
Harry: *His expression was one of wonder, and Draco's throat closed up at the sight, so the only way he had to make him see was to pull at his hair harder until Harry got the hint and leant forward.*
Draco: *Their lips were pressed together again, and it was glorious.*
Harry: *Harry's arms wrapped around his middle, nails digging on his skin, and he pressed Draco against him so tightly that it was difficult to breathe, and when he did, their chests were crushed together in an almost painful way; Draco had the feeling their ribs would break, but couldn't find it in himself to care.*
Draco: *There was too much heat, everywhere: their bodies in alignment, a warm feeling pooling in his stomach, hot trails on his cheeks that Draco refused to believe were tears.*
Harry: *He licked the inside of Harry's mouth when he parted his lips, unravelling at the same time Harry melted against him, and suddenly what they did wasn't kissing anymore: it was mouths wide open and devouring each other, it was years of building up exploding in an spectacular display of desperation, it was fierce and messy and tasted like salt (bloody hell, he had been crying after all).*
Draco: *That long, seemingly endless kiss turned sweet again, just for a while, before slowing down, lingering an instant, and stopping completely.*
Harry: *Draco refused to open his eyes, no matter how many butterfly kisses Harry left on the corners of his lips, and soon heard him laughing quietly.* You're just being stubborn now, *he complained, as Draco let his hands fall from his hair to his shoulders.*
Draco: Don't talk, *Draco said in response, voice quiet and softer than he thought he'd ever be able to utter.* You always fuck it up when you speak. And now that I've seen what you can do with your mouth, I'll..."
29,4731860,Draco,Harry,"Draco: You're just being stubborn now, he complained, as Draco let his hands fall from his hair to his shoulders.
Harry: Don't talk, Draco said in response, voice quiet and softer than he thought he'd ever be able to utter. You always fuck it up when you speak. And now that I've seen what you can do with your mouth, I'll be much more disappointed if you use it to say something stupid.
Harry: Look at me, Draco.
Draco: He did, Merlin knew why, and met Harry's eyes. They were greener than ever and also kind of blurry, which gave Draco great relief, because it meant he might have not been the only one who had turned into a Hufflepuff.
Draco: Fucking finally, he breathed, tension leaving his body.
Harry: That's my line, Harry huffed.
Draco: Draco shook his head, knees suddenly weak and wobbly. Trust me, it's not.
Harry: You have no idea.
Draco: Well... he hummed, smiling. I guess my arse is not the only thing about me that you like.
Harry: No, I guess it's not, Draco admitted, smiling back. Although you do have a damn fine arse.
Harry: Harry stared at him, a brow raised in surprise, and burst out laughing; it was throaty, quiet, just for him. Draco loved it.
Harry: I like your arse, too, Harry said after a while, thoughtful, and the way he looked at him then made Draco's chest tighten. But I like a lot of things about you.
Draco: That was when Draco pounced on him to kiss him again, the door of the common room swung open, and Pansy screamed in joy.
Draco: Don't you even know how to button up a coat? Draco snorted, pulling Harry towards him by the lapels.
Harry: I do, and I have! he replied, indignant.
Draco: He raised a brow. You're useless, Potter.
Harry: Harry smiled gingerly, admitting defeat. That's why I have you.
Draco: If you only needed me for that, you ridiculous human being, he mumbled, focused on fixing the buttons, you'd have stuck with Ginevra Weasley. Surely she can do as much.
Harry: Not as well as you, treacle tart.
Draco: The grin in Harry's face was so smug that Draco didn't know whether to kiss him or punch him. He glared at him, just in case, and hissed threateningly, You survived The Dark Lord, Potter, don't make me be the one who kills you.
Pansy: Would you two stop bantering? Pansy sighed as she walked out of the common room, Granger by her side; both of them dragged their trunks behind them. We all know it only ever leads to more snogging, and in case you have forgotten, we have to go.
Granger: Granger took in the scene and folded her arms over her chest, looking stern. She directed most of her power of persuasion to Harry, but that didn't mean Draco didn't feel it too.
Draco: Truly, that witch was fearful. It was no wonder she'd befriended Pansy; they were the only ones who could keep up with each other's levels of wickedness.
Draco: Draco shivered slightly and stepped away, once he checked Harry didn't look like a tramp anymore, forcing himself to keep a certain distance despite the puppy eyes Harry was making at him.
Granger: Harry, Granger huffed, exchanging a quick glance with Pansy. We're not going to stay in Hogwarts for Christmas because you started early with your goodbyes. We're not even in the train yet, for all the gods, and you haven't been a second apart in a month and a half. I think you'll survive.
Weasley: I agree, Weasley piped up, suddenly appearing behind Granger. He grimaced, glancing at them, And on another note, you've unsettled my stomach.
Harry: Excuse you, Ron, how do you"
30,4731860,Weasley,Draco,"Weasley: And on another note, you've unsettled my stomach.
Draco: Excuse you, Ron, how do you think I feel when I catch you and 'Mione snogging?
Weasley: Harry, honestly, do you want me to kill you?
Pansy: You can fight later!
Draco: We know how to walk, Pans.
Pansy: Shut up, dear.
Granger: Hermione, can you Levitate our trunks?
Draco: Ron will help me.
Draco: Honestly, Blaise, you knock it off, you're ruining our fun!
Weasley: Harry, mate, Mom's going to be here in a minute. Do you really want her to see this?
Granger: Ron, he's not going to lie to Molly and tell her he's dating Ginny, or whatever it is what you've been thinking."
31,4731860,Draco,Ron,"Draco: Ron, he's not going to lie to Molly and tell her he's dating Ginny, or whatever it is what you've been thinking, Granger warned sternly, and Draco liked her just a little bit more because of it.

Ron: I'm not asking him to lie, 'Mione! Weasley said, turning his begging eyes at her. I just want him to stop snogging Malfoy in front of me! Is it too much to ask? he whined. Is it?! You know I've been a good friend, overall. Maybe a few slip ups, but who hasn't...?

Harry: Ron, shut up, Harry gave a deep suffering sigh, which was all drama. For once, Draco was in complete agreement. No more snogging today, I promise.

Draco: Don't tell me your 'no snogging' rule is in force. It'll better have been a filthy little lie to get our friends off our backs.

Harry: Oh, it wasn't a lie, but that rule isn't in full force until we part.

Pansy: Well, Draco, I hope you've finished your snogging session, because we've just seen your Mother on our way here. She'll be here in a moment.

Draco: Are you sure you don't want to come? he asked him, offering him his most tempting smile.

Harry: Are you sure you don't want to come? he said, beaming.

Draco: How many Weasleys are there, again?

Ron: Don't sulk, Harry, Weasley butted in, patting his friend's back. He's just afraid I'll win at chess if he comes to the Burrow.

Granger: Ron, don't be a child. Draco has to go and finish saying goodbye to Harry, if he may.

Draco: Thank you, Grang- Hermione. Another dying noise from Weasley. He could get used to it. Sweetheart? he called, turning his head to Harry."
32,4731860,Draco,Harry,"Draco: Draco has to go and finish saying goodbye to Harry, if he may.
Weasley: *sharp intake of breath*
Draco: Thank you, Grang- Hermione.
Weasley: *dying noise*
Draco: Sweetheart? *calls to Harry*
Weasley: *choking on his own spit*
Harry: Draco?
Draco: That's mine, *snatches back the Gryffindor tie*
Harry: No, I don't think so. Actually, I'd swear it's mine.
Draco: *thinking about how to get the upper hand*
Draco: Happy Christmas! I'll owl you all.
Draco: *steals a quick kiss from Harry*
Draco: I'll owl you all.
Draco: *bolts away*
Draco: *notices their friends smiling*
Draco's Mother: *approaching swiftly*
Draco: *sneaks away*
Draco's Mother: *finds him a second after*
Draco's Mother: *tells him she knew something was up*
Draco: *ignores his Mother and stares at nowhere*
Draco: *lost in thoughts of green eyes and kisses*
Draco: *still tightly clutches the Gryffindor tie*"
