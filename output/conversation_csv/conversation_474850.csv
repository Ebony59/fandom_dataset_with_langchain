0,474850,Viktor,Lyubezen,"Viktor: It tickles. *glances up*
Viktor: Nice, huh? Lyubezen. Not a word he often hears used about himself -- brilliant, dour, and bone-headed are all more frequently bestowed -- but he likes it. *smiles a little, rubs his thumb gently over the angry red spot on the knuckle of her toe*
Viktor: Hurts, this? *lifts the other foot and checks*
Viktor: Yes, vy not put a Crucio on each foot and haff it done vith? *laughs*
Viktor: This vot made you cry, then? Hurt so much, you ran avay?
Viktor: No, no, is fine.
Viktor: About you and me?
Viktor: Someone you care about.
Viktor: I hope I didn't make you trouble, asking you to ball.
Viktor: Vell, in that case, Pepeliashka, vould you do me honour of another dance?
Viktor: Don't you haff other shoes?
Viktor: You velcome to stand on my shoes ven ve dance, save your pretty toes. *takes her hand, gently pulls her to her feet as he stands up*"
1,474850,Viktor,Hermione,"Viktor: What ... that word you said, 'pepel ... iashka' something. Bulgarian, right? What did you call me?
Viktor: Later, I vill tell.
Viktor: It vasn't something bad.
Hermione: I know that. I know you wouldn't.
Viktor: Her-my-nee, my Bulgarian is as good as your English. I speak vell in my language.
Hermione: Oh, Viktor! I understand that!
Viktor: It is just ... I know I sound stupid; sometimes I hear English students ... repeat my vords. And not ... nice vay. Behind my back. I haff only learnt for two years. I speak Russian, good as a Russian -- even German, I speak quite vell, because I started learn as little boy.
Hermione: But you see, it isn't only what you say; it is... it is the sum of someone's words and actions and ... demeanour ... that makes that person seem ... eloquent. And I think you are.
Viktor: *thinks this is probably not the right moment to confess that he doesn't know the word 'eloquent', either. He gets the gist of what she's saying, he hopes.*
Viktor: *looks down at her bowed head with that lovely wild hair all sleek and tamed, and he wants to kiss her, so badly. But at the same time, it seems rather too early for that.*
Viktor: *wants to dance, too.*
Hermione: *both draw breath to speak simultaneously, and Hermione checks herself and looks up at him.*
Viktor: *gives her hand a small squeeze before letting go, and bends over to pick up her shoes.* I vill carry your beautiful instruments of torture.
Hermione: No, Viktor, leave them. *stays him with a touch of his shoulder* I'll pick them up later.
Viktor: They vill haff butterbeer for company, at least.
Hermione: A party of their own, *she agrees.*
Viktor: *offers her his arm*"
