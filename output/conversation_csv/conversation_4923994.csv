1,4923994,William Weasley,Hyacinthe,"William Weasley: I'd like to take an Anima test, *politely*
Goblin: That'll be ten galleons, *dismisses Hyacinthe*
Hyacinthe: *sits the coins down on the counter*
Goblin: Somegoblin will be along to collect soon, *dismisses Hyacinthe*"
2,4923994,Hyacinthe,Goblin,"Hyacinthe: Drink the potion, the seated goblin ordered with a sneer.
Goblin: Congratulations, Miss Potter, you've met your soulmate.

Hyacinthe: With her voice caught in her throat, Hyacinthe wasn't sure how to react. She was overjoyed that she had met her soulmate, but at the same time she was crushed. She met her soulmate, but she didn't know who he was. There was a chance they would never properly meet.

Goblin: Pick this up, he ordered.
Hyacinthe: *grabbing the parchment*

Hyacinthe: William Weasley. Off the top of her head, Hyacinthe couldn't think of a William Weasley. He was probably one of Ron's older brothers. Ron said his brothers were Bill and Charlie. Was William actually Bill?

Hyacinthe: It looked like Hyacinthe would be writing Ron soon. Hopefully he could tell her where Bill was.

Goblin: Wait here, the goblin ordered as he stood up and exited the room.
Hyacinthe: *watching him* What was going on?

Hyacinthe: The first person she would be telling would be Sirius. Hopefully he would be happy. There was a time or two when Sirius got misty-eyed and looked ready to cry when Hyacinthe's age came up. He, probably, wasn't ready for her to be a teenager.

Sirius: *picking up the piece of parchment and staring at it* You Potters have all the luck! James met Lily on the boats. *smiling* Lily's mark said 'Can I call you Lily-flower?' and James' said 'You can call me Miss Evans. We've only just met.'

Hyacinthe: I didn't know that,"

Sirius: James met Lily on the boats. *smiles* Lily's mark said 'Can I call you Lily-flower?' and James' said 'You can call me Miss Evans. We've only just met.'
Hyacinthe: I didn't know that. She didn't know a lot about her parents...
Sirius: James was in love from that moment, and Lily wasn't so easily convinced.
Hyacinthe: What does that mean?
Sirius: Bill Weasley is a Curse Breaker. He'll be moving back to London within the week.
Hyacinthe: But why?
Sirius: It's in the treaty with the goblins. In event Gringotts discovers one of their employees has met their soulmate, the employee is transferred to be near the soulmate.
Hyacinthe: That makes no sense.
Sirius: In our world, soulmate pairings are rare and honored.
Hyacinthe: The following Tuesday, Sirius made dinner arrangements at The Magic Lamp...
Hyacinthe: Taking a deep breath, Hyacinthe threw down the floo powder and said, 'The Magic Lamp.'
Hyacinthe: Y-yes, thank you. When it comes to flooing, I'm a klutz.
Hyacinthe: Are you alright?"
4,4923994,Hyacinthe,Wizard,"Hyacinthe: Are you alright?
Wizard: Y-yes, thank you. When it comes to flooing, I'm a klutz.
Hyacinthe: It's not me. I've already met mine.
Wizard: He's lucky.
Hyacinthe: The reservations are under Black.
Sirius: Sorry, I got held up. Anything interesting happen before I arrive?
Hyacinthe: I fell out of the floo and someone caught me. He thought I was his soulmate.
Sirius: Really?
Hyacinthe: Red hair, blue eyes, fang earring?
Sirius: I'll be right back.
Sirius: Hyacinthe, I want you to meet William Weasley.
Bill: I prefer Bill.
Hyacinthe: H-hi. Sorry about earlier.
Bill: I'm just glad I found you. Do you remember when we met - before?
Hyacinthe: Kinda. Your mum was thanking for saving Ginny, again, and Percy wanted to leave.
Bill: At your Words are memorable.
Bill: I'm happy to relocate to London for Hyacinthe.
Bill: He helped Hyacinthe with her summer homework and he recommended numerous books - mostly on Ancient Runes - and he helped Hyacinthe look into future careers.
Hyacinthe: While being a Curse Breaker sounded like fun, I was thinking of teaching or writing.
Sirius: Whenever they met, Sirius or Nala was present as Bill and Hyacinthe were in the 'courting' phase of their relationship."
5,4923994,Sirius,Bill,"Sirius: There's something special happening at Hogwarts this year. It's the Triwizard Tournament.
Bill: Why are you telling me this?
Hyacinthe: Why would I do that? I have eternal fame and glory, and I'm plenty rich.
Sirius: I think you'll be competing.
Hyacinthe: We think someone else will enter you.
Sirius: If you are entered into the Tournament, then you and Bill are bonding. As a newly wed witch, you'll be excused.
Bill: Cin, it's the only solution. I'm not willing to risk your safety. While I'm sure you can compete and do fine, I can't lose you. I do want to spend the rest of my life with you.
Hyacinthe: Okay."
6,4923994,Hyacinthe,Sirius,"Hyacinthe: Sirius! *called at the mirror*
Sirius: We'll be there within the hour. *announced before disappearing*
Hyacinthe: It happened! I'm the fourth Champion.
Hermione: Ron's mad.
Hyacinthe: It'll just get worse. Once he found out she was his eldest brother's soulmate, his head was going to explode.
Hermione: I met my soulmate.
Hyacinthe: We're bonding. Tonight.
Hermione: Am I invited?
Hyacinthe: Of course."
7,4923994,Hyacinthe,Bill,"Hyacinthe: I think I have everything. *turning away from the mirror* My something old, my something new, my something blue, and my something borrowed.
Hyacinthe: With a deep breath, Hyacinthe walked out the door. Her wedding was starting.
Hyacinthe: To clear her head of thoughts of Ron Weasley, Hyacinthe glanced around.
Hyacinthe: Hyacinthe found Sirius waiting for her. *busy crying into a handkerchief and muttering to himself*
Hyacinthe: Pull it together, Sirius, *whispered* You can cry all you want after you've handed me over to Bill.
Sirius: *wiping his tears away* *nodded*
Hyacinthe: *looped her arm through his with a smile*
Hermione: A moment later, Hermione was walking down the aisle a large smile on her face.
Remus: Wands? *holding his hands out*
Sirius: *handing Remus a silver Marriage Wand*
Charlie: *handing over a gold Marriage Wand*
Remus: Are we ready? *looking at the couple*

Hyacinthe: I do.
Remus: Rings?
Remus: William, repeat after me: With this ring I bond with thee forevermore until the day we part or until death.
Bill: *nods and rubs his thumb over Hyacinthe's knuckles* With this ring, I with bond thee forevermore until the day we part or until death. *slides the ring onto Hyacinthe's finger*

9,4923994,Ginny,Bill,"Ginny: So, what name are you and Bill using?
Hermione: Potter.
Ginny: The Ancient and Noble House of Potter is a Sacred House, and the name needs to be continued. So, Bill is expected to take the Potter name.
Hermione: *nodded*
Hyacinthe: *smiled*
Hermione: *pleased to be included in the category of sister*
Hyacinthe: *watched her best friend's reaction*

Hyacinthe: To be honest, I didn't even care what Ron and Percy thought.
Hyacinthe: Hyacinthe knew her friendship with Ron was over – or at least she considered it to be over.
Hyacinthe: *didn't let Ron shut Hermione out after she was petrified*
Hyacinthe: *was expecting the worst from Ron*
Hyacinthe: *understood that romantic soulmates were uncommon in the Wizarding World*
Ginny: I'm curious, what're your Words?

Hyacinthe: *Without a word, Hyacinthe rolled up her left sleeve.*
Hermione: That's hardly romantic. How did you and Bill meet then?
Ginny: The first was after the Chamber. Your mom was busy hugging me and Percy wanted to leave. While Percy ushered everyone out, Bill called to me.
Hyacinthe: After third year, I took an Anima test at Gringotts. Because of some treaty, Bill was brought back to London, and Sirius arranged dinner. The second time we met, Bill caught me exiting the floo.
Hermione: *started to laugh*
Ginny: That explains why Bill hung around fireplaces.
Hyacinthe: *smiled, her face continuing to heat up*

Professor McGonagall: Miss Potter, you're needed in the headmaster's office.
Hyacinthe: *got up with a nod*
Professor McGonagall: *stopped in front of the gargoyle* Candy corn.

Crouch: *no dialogue*
Sirius: Hyacinthe is fourteen, and since she is underage, she should have my permission to compete. I refuse to grant permission.
Dumbledore: Sirius, I'm afraid there is no way for Miss Potter to be removed from the Tournament.
Sirius: Actually there is. Last night, Hyacinthe bonded with her soulmate.
Crouch: That only works if both Miss Potter and her alleged husband remove her.
Hyacinthe: It's Lady Potter. She lifted her left hand and showed the judges her ring.
Bill: We don't want Hyacinthe competing.
Dumbledore: Congratulations, Lord-Consort and Lady Potter. As a married witch, I'm afraid Lady Potter will no longer be welcome to live in the castle.
Sirius: She'll be commuting.

Hyacinthe: *caught Hyacinthe's attention*
Hyacinthe: Are you even listening to me, Potter?
Malfoy: You should listen to your superiors.
Hyacinthe: You're not my superior.
Malfoy: You'll change your tone when I'm Lord Black.
Hyacinthe: I'll never be a mistress.
Malfoy: You won't get much of a say in it, Potter. After all, there are numerous potions I can use to control you.

Malfoy: You filthy little Mudblood!
Snape: Potter, Granger, what are you doing? That'll be twenty points from Gryffindor, each.
Hyacinthe: Malfoy cast the first spell. I only cast a Shield Charm.

Hyacinthe: Here. *handing over the reports*
Hyacinthe: I'll be hiring my own Potions tutor, and I'll open lessons up to select few.
Professor McGonagall: I'm assuming Ms. Granger will be joining you.
Hyacinthe: *nodding*
Professor McGonagall: Ms. Granger, you'll need your parents to fill out these forums withdrawing you from the class.
Hermione: *looking over the paperwork*
Hyacinthe: *taking the paperwork from Hermione* Sirius will take it to your parents tomorrow.
Professor McGonagall: Now, Lady Potter, don't worry about the detention. However, the points will remain as you two skipped class. As punishment, you both will serve detention with me on Sunday.
Hyacinthe: *spending Saturday with Bill*"
14,4923994,Hyacinthe,Viktor Krum,"Hyacinthe: Where were you Friday? *asked a heavily accented male voice.*
Viktor Krum: You didn't really enter did you?

Hyacinthe: Why did you wear a white dress?"
16,4923994,Hyacinthe,Hermione,"Hyacinthe: Why did you wear a white dress? *Hyacinthe's eyes narrowed* White is the color muggles wear, and it was my mum's dress.
Lavender: Why wear your mum's dress?
Hyacinthe: *steps away from Lavender and closer to Hermione*

Hermione: *glaring at Parvati*

Hyacinthe: Everyone wanted to know about her bonding. *Hyacinthe ignored them* No one was allowed to demand answers from her.
Hyacinthe: *noting each individuals name and questions*

Hyacinthe: Having a private potions tutor boosted Hyacinthe's popularity with her year mates and other students. *Most students hated lessons with Snape, and they wanted out.*
Hyacinthe: *Currently, Hyacinthe invited Hermione, Neville Longbottom, Ginny, Katie, and Ginny's friend Luna Lovegood from Ravenclaw.*
Ron: He didn't understand why Hyacinthe would rather 'study' with Hermione, his sister, Loony, and Longbottom than him. *After all, he was Hyacinthe's best friend.*

Hyacinthe: *Joining her friends in the stands* The First Task ended with Viktor in first, Delacour in second, and Diggory trailing behind in third.
Hogwarts students: *The mood of the Hogwarts students was soured. Their Champion was in last – he was losing.*"
17,4923994,Ginny,Luna,"Ginny: How could a Hogwarts student be losing? Everyone knew Hogwarts was the best magical school in the world. *sets Luna up with Neville* I'm busy looking for my own date.
Katie: Viktor asked Hermione, and she decided to keep it a secret.
Hyacinthe: Hyacinthe sought permission to bring her husband, which was granted by Professor McGonagall.
Hyacinthe: On Christmas Day, Hyacinthe was awoken by Padfoot jumping on her bed. *tries to shove Padfoot off the bed* In retaliation, Padfoot licked Hyacinthe before barking and jumping up and down on the bed.
Hyacinthe: With a sigh, Hyacinthe changed out of her pajamas and into a pair of Gryffindor sweatpants and a black tank top. *heads into the living room where she found Bill, Sirius, Remus, Ginny, Molly, and Arthur seated* With a smile, Hyacinthe took the seat next to her husband.
Sirius: Without a word, Sirius started handing out gifts. *got a new helmet for his motorcycle, and a dragon-hide jacket*
Hyacinthe: She had a hard time trying to decide on a gift for her husband. With assistance from Sirius, Hyacinthe found a few Ancient Runes scrolls in one of the vaults.
Hyacinthe: Hyacinthe was touched by the gifts she received. *received some homemade candies and a few jumpers from Molly and Arthur* Charlie gave her a pair of dragon-hide boots while Percy gave her a book on studying tips and a new quill, and the twins gave her a few joke items inspired by the Marauders' Map."

Bill: Bill and Hyacinthe's relationship was evolving.
Hyacinthe: Hyacinthe still wasn't ready for anything sexual, but liked kissing her husband and she loved being in his arms."
19,4923994,Hyacinthe,Hermione,"Hyacinthe: Did you find her?
Ginny: When did you guys last see her?
Katie: Dinner, I think.
Hyacinthe: I'll ask McGonagall.
Hyacinthe: I was wondering if you knew where Hermione was. I can't find her, and no one has seen her since last night.
Professor McGonagall: Miss Granger will be fine. She'll return after Mister Krum's recovery during the Second Task. I'll speak with you later, Lady Potter.

Witch Weekly: Apparently the only reason someone like Viktor would date someone like Hermione was to get close to her best friend, Hyacinthe Potter. Hermione was secretly jealous of Hyacinthe, which everyone knew."
20,4923994,Hermione Granger,Hyacinthe Potter,"Hermione Granger: The article was largely a piece of fiction and lies. Apparently the only reason someone like Viktor would date someone like Hermione was to get close her best friend, Hyacinthe Potter. Hermione was secretly jealous of Hyacinthe, which everyone knew. *description of Hermione's feelings towards Hyacinthe*
Witch Weekly: The following day Witch Weekly printed a retraction, and they offered a “friendship test” so girls could figure out how close of friends they were. The highest ranking possible was Hyacinthe and Hermione. It wasn't everyday a muggle-born was granted Honorary Member status in an Ancient and Noble House.
Hyacinthe Potter: The next few weeks flew by. Hyacinthe attended classes and she hung out with her friends before returning home to Bill and Sirius. Bill and Hyacinthe had a standing “date night” so their relationship could grow. In between Hyacinthe was working on homework and she learning what her duties of Lady Potter entailed. Several of the cases went to court. A few were settled out of court, completely with a magical gag order. Sirius and his legal overall the cases. Hyacinthe had little interest in most of the cases. The only ones that interested were with the ones with the Malfoy family and some other Slytherins.
Professor Moody: One day near the end of May, Professor Moody disappeared. He was at dinner the night before and the following morning, Dumbledore announced Moody had a sudden departure. Until a suitable placement could be found, Professor Remus Lupin had agreed to take over teaching with some assigns from Nymphadora Tonks and Sirius Black.
Hyacinthe Potter: The following weekend, Hyacinthe was given the entire story of Professor Moody's sudden departure. The Hogwarts rumor mill wasn't even close. Hogwarts rumors included Moody's paranoia, a falling out with Dumbledore, and being tried for use of the Unforgivable Curses. The trust was far more sinister. Professor Moody wasn't even the real Alastor Moody, and that was only the tip of the iceberg. *description of the story about Barty Crouch Junior and the Dark Lord's plans*
Headmaster Dumbledore: Headmaster Dumbledore figured this all out when Crouch Senior was discovered on Hogwarts grounds by Ludo Bagman and Cedric Diggory. The pair immediately escorted the man to the Hospital Wing before alerting the headmaster. Under the care of Madam Pomfrey, Crouch Senior was able to warn Headmaster Dumbledore about the fake Moody before passing out. Crouch Senior has since been moved to the Janus Thickey Ward for Spell Damage at St. Mungo's Hospital for Magical Maladies and Injuries. After receiving the information from Crouch Senior, Headmaster Dumbledore contacted the Department of Magical Law Enforcement for some aurors. Half a dozen aurors arrived with Madam Bones. Together with the headmaster, the aurors retrained the fake Moody and they secured him a heavily warded room. Before their eyes the fake Moody's Polyjuice Potion wore off, forcing him to return to the form of Barty Crouch Junior. Under the supervision of Madam Bones, Crouch Junior was questioned under Veritaserum. The questions spanned over hours with questions ranging from his childhood to his “escape” from Azkaban to the Dark Lord's plans for the Girl-Who-Lived."

Goldie: A simple procedure checking for foreign magic and entities.
Hyacinthe: W-what kind of entities?
Goldie: We have reason to believe Tom Riddle left something behind when he attacked you on Halloween.

Longsword: To our knowledge, he has created four horcruxes.
Sirius: Four?
Longsword: And counting. We're actively looking for more.
Bill: What do you need from us?
Longsword: We need permission from Lord Black to search vaults of interest.
Sirius: *nodded*

Bill: With little idea where Hyacinthe wanted to travel to, Bill arranged a trip down to Cairo, Egypt.
Bill: And, since, he was in the area, Bill would check in at his old protection.
Bill: But long-term times in the field would have to wait a few more years.
Bill: Hyacinthe still had three years left at Hogwarts.
Bill: He didn't want to rob her or force her into giving up her school years and her friends, anymore than he already had.

Bill: Three days later, Bill and Hyacinthe arrived to the Gringotts located in the bazaar of the magical part of Cairo, Egypt.
Bill: When Bill received an official Gringotts letter baring the seal of the goblin king, his heart stopped.
Bill: Upon opening the letter, he found he was being transferred from the dig sites in Cairo to the bank in London.

Nala: The hotel was large with two separate bedrooms.
Nala: Nala quickly claimed the large master room for Hyacinthe, leaving Bill the second room."
23,4923994,Bill,Nala,"Bill: The hotel was large with two separate bedrooms. Nala quickly claimed the large master room for Hyacinthe, leaving me the second room. The second room was decently sized with a full bed, a dresser, and a closet. Since the master room had its own bathroom, I had a small bathroom to myself. Outside of the bedrooms, there was a main area containing a couch, two armchairs, a coffee table, a dining room table with six chairs, and a small kitchenette. Most of our meals would be eaten in the hotel restaurants or delivered through room service, but Nala would likely prepare a few meals. Even though Hyacinthe and I were bonded, Nala came along to act as a chaperone. She has the responsibility of making sure we behaved appropriately. In addition, she would make sure we were well taken care of.

Hyacinthe: Bill and I stayed in Cairo for three weeks. We spent a few days exploring the bazaar. I had never been to a magical district outside of Diagon Alley and Hogsmeade before. The bazaar was large with many small shops, several restaurants and cafes, and a few museums. I was eager to explore the museums, wanting to learn more about Egypt. We spent a week exploring the pyramids and visiting various sites around the Cairo area, both magical and muggle. Another week was spent at Bill's former dig site. I had the opportunity to watch my husband at work while learning firsthand what a dig site was like and what being a curse breaker entailed. The rest of the time was spent in our hotel. I wrote daily letters to Sirius and exchanged letters with some of my friends, mostly Ginny and Hermione. Most of my free time was spent either in the pool or poolside. Bill enjoyed watching me in either setting. My body was developing into the body of a young woman. During our trips to the pool, Nala remained close to Bill, often shocking him if he gazed too long at me.

Hyacinthe: When the first of September arrived, I boarded the Hogwarts Express with my friends and classmates. While I no longer resided in the castle, I was eager to catch up with my friends regarding their summers and I wanted to stick to my routine. After a summer of adventure with Bill, I was looking forward to a boring school year.

Bill: While Hyacinthe and I were exploring Cairo, Egypt, Sirius, Dumbledore, and a few goblins from Gringotts worked on finding and destroying the remaining horcruxes. There were seven in total. With the horcruxes destroyed, the threat of Voldemort's return was eliminated. It was something everyone involved was happy about.

Hyacinthe: Throughout the summer, I exchanged regular letters with Hermione Granger. Hermione spent half of the summer in France with her parents and Viktor, and the other half in Bulgaria with her parents, Viktor, and Viktor's family. According to her letters, Viktor placed an emphasis on Hermione spending time with her parents since she attended boarding school nine months of the year. Summer was a time for fun and family, as far as Viktor was considered. And Viktor made sure to include himself.

Hyacinthe: Hermione's parents adored Viktor as they got to know him. Daniel and Emma Granger hit it off with Stevan and Sofie Krum. Stevan and Sofie didn't care about Hermione being muggle-born or her parents being muggles. Sofie was the daughter of a squib, and she happily answered any and all questions the Grangers had.

Hyacinthe: By the end of their stay in Bulgaria, Emma and Sofie had two ceremonies planned out – a traditional bonding and a traditional muggle wedding, both of which would take place on the same day. In addition, the parents had started the process of creating a betrothal agreement, once Daniel and Emma understood the importance of the agreement.

Hyacinthe: A betrothal agreement included several important details. It was common practice for witches and wizards to create a betrothal agreement upon entering a serious relationship. It was a binding contract, though it could be broken for several agreed-upon reasons. The important details included a courting phase, which would last at least until I graduated from Hogwarts, before Viktor would propose. The date of the wedding would depend on Viktor and me, but it would be at least six months after the proposal. Any children would be born when both Viktor and I were ready, and I didn't want children until after I was settled into my career. Any and all money made during the marriage would be..."
24,4923994,Hyacinthe,Bill,"Hyacinthe: Fifth year found me thinking about my future - both my future career and my future family. Bill and I have been discussing it. He wants a family, but only wants two to five children. He's open to adopting and wants one biological child. Personally, Bill wants children as soon as possible, but he understands that I'm too young right now. He's willing to wait until I start my career, and he's even considering being the parent to stay home and raise our children. Being a curse breaker is amazing, but having a family with my soulmate is Bill's dream. *descriptions copied from original text*

Hyacinthe: I'm thinking about being a librarian. With my Parseltongue abilities and my interest in Warding, I could build an amazing library filled with rare books. People might even pay me to translate them. Thanks to Bill, I have a number of leads on books. *descriptions copied from original text*

Hyacinthe: Despite it being my fifth year, the school year went by quickly. It was a blur of homework, schoolwork, studying, and reading. I was busy with OWLs. Every spare moment I had, I spent studying. There was so much to learn and review. *descriptions copied from original text*

Hyacinthe: Outside of studying, I spent time with my friends and family, and I continued to serve as the Seeker on the Gryffindor Quidditch team. Quidditch kept me busy since Professor McGonagall and Angelina Johnson were determined to keep the Quidditch Cup. *descriptions copied from original text*"
25,4923994,Hyacinthe,Ginny,"Hyacinthe: How did you meet? *having a feeling she knew the identity of Ginny's soulmate. She knew her sister-in-law would tell her when she ready, which might be today or another day. There was no rush.*
Ginny: Last year, *a blush covering her cheeks as her fingers of her left hand danced on top of her right wrist, above her Words.* I was out passed curfew when I ran into Miss Norris. I wasn't the only one hiding in a broom closet.
Hyacinthe: Which prank was this?
Ginny: The blue one.
Hyacinthe: *laughing a little* So, what happened next?
Ginny: De–He was already in the broom closet, *Ginny explained, slipping a little.* When I bopped into him he said 'Sorry, this spot is taken. I'll share, but it's mine.'
Hyacinthe: *nodding, noting Ginny's slip.* What did you say?
Ginny: *smiling* I said 'I didn't know anyone was here. I need to hide from Filch'.
Hyacinthe: Are you happy? *a serious tone in her voice.*
Ginny: *nodding with a smile* Very happy, *she replied.* We're not ready to announce, but I wanted to tell someone.
Hyacinthe: *sharing a smile*"
26,4923994,Ginny,Bill,"Ginny: but I wanted to tell someone. *shared a smile*
Ginny: Don't tell Bill! *hissed*
Hyacinthe: *nodded, agreed to keep the secret until summer*
Hyacinthe: *didn't want to hide anything from her husband, this wasn't her secret to share*
...
Hyacinthe: *Following Ginny's secret confession, learned Luna and Neville were soulmates*
Hyacinthe: *The young couple was happy to inform their closest friends, wanting to keep the knowledge private*
Hyacinthe: *Knowing that some of her closest friends were in relationships with their soulmates got Hyacinthe thinking*
Hyacinthe: *she was thrilled for her friends, Hyacinthe was curious if this was the start of a trend*
...
Hyacinthe: *Before Hyacinthe knew, she was sitting down for her OWLs*
Hyacinthe: *All of the examiners had turned to watch Prongs as he pranced around*
Hyacinthe: *When scheduling her OWLs, Hyacinthe had opted to take the Muggle Studies exam at Hermione's urging*
Hyacinthe: *Hyacinthe had finished the exam in twenty minutes, tying with Hermione in their rush to finish*
Hyacinthe: *In the end, Hyacinthe passed all of her OWLs, some with Outstanding and others with Acceptable*
...
Hyacinthe: *The summer passed quickly, between traveling with her family and visiting her friends*
Hyacinthe: *Hyacinthe knew Bill and Sirius were up together*
Hyacinthe: *There were several days one or both of them were out of the apartment*
Hyacinthe: *Hyacinthe saw their secret looks and the shared smiles*
Hyacinthe: *For the time being, she was willing to let them have their secret*
Hyacinthe: *Hyacinthe, Bill, and Sirius went to France with Hermione, her parents, and Viktor for two weeks*

...
Hyacinthe: *Like fifth year before it, sixth year went by quickly*
Hyacinthe: *One day, Hyacinthe was sitting down at the Gryffindor table with Katie and Hermione, deep in conversation about classes*
Hyacinthe: *The next, Hyacinthe was hugging Katie goodbye as her friend made plans to leave the country to play Quidditch in Iceland*
Hyacinthe: *Since she passed her OWLs, Hyacinthe was taking a full schedule with Transfiguration, Potions, Defense Against the Dark Arts, Charms, Ancient Runes, and Arithmancy*"
27,4923994,Hyacinthe,Bill,"Katie: Overall, the year had been a little boring, which Hyacinthe found to be a welcome change. She spent the year acting like a normal student: doing her homework, worrying about her grades, thinking about her future, hanging out with her friends, and playing Quidditch.
Hermione: Seventh year was filled with studying. From the moment classes began in September, Hyacinthe found herself spending a majority of her time studying. Between classes and meals, she would join Hermione at a table in the library. Ever the organizer, Hermione created a studying schedule, starting with a review of first year material and moving onward.

Hyacinthe: Giving their relationship, Hyacinthe didn't mind and Bill didn't complain, too much. There were times he wanted to make out with his wife. Their physical relationship hadn't processed much in the last six months. It went unsaid that the topic of sex would be discussed after Hyacinthe graduated form Hogwarts. Despite being married for over a year and a half, they were no near ready to have sex."
28,4923994,Hyacinthe,Bill,"Hyacinthe: I'll take some time off. Maybe a year or two.
Bill: You should focus on your career. I'll take some time off. Curse Breaking's rather dangerous.
Bill: My dream's to have a large family with my soulmate. My family with you is the most important thing.
Bill: If that's what you want, he promised before pulling her in for a kiss."
