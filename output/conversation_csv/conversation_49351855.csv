0,49351855,May,Phil,"May: Watch me, Momma! I'm watching.
Phil: *puts his arm around May's waist, pulls her closer* What'cha thinking about?
May: Nothing much. *closes her eyes, fully relaxing into his embrace*
Phil: Gonna take a nap?
May: *closes her eyes* Mm.
Skye: Hey, baby girl. All tired out?
Phil: *moves his hand to Skye's head* Wanna look at the clouds.
Skye: 's Mom sleeping?
Phil: I think so.
May: *smiles to herself* *Skye's small hand wraps around hers, and May squeezes back, ever so slightly*"
1,49351855,May,Phil,"May: I couldn't save her.
Phil: It's all right. You have to let the girl go, Melinda. You did good. Let the girl go.
May: *sobbing into Phil's chest*
May: There is a child dead because of her, a little girl who had eyes like her daughter's, a girl she was supposed to help, supposed to save. I should've saved her.
Phil: *holding May, murmuring something in her ear*
May: *staring*
Steve: Was he married?
Tony: Yeah. They had a... daughter, I think.
May: He's not gone. He can't be gone.
Maria Hill: Agent Coulson was killed in action before the Battle of New York.
May: *silence*
May: *closing curtains, locking the front door, turning on the light in the kitchen*"
2,49351855,May,Melinda,"May: I am so sorry, Melinda. If there’s anything I can do to help you...
May: *opens her mouth but her voice won’t work. After an eternity of silence Maria murmurs a goodbye and hangs up. When May finally moves, it’s dark outside. She goes through the motions of closing the curtains, locking the front door, turning on the light in the kitchen, but she’s numb.*
May: *thinks* Any minute now, he’ll walk through the door and he’ll pull me into his arms and scold me for worrying. Except that moment doesn’t come, and somewhere, some part of her keeps whispering that it never will.
May: *closes the barrier and spins around, dropping the tablet. Skye’s sitting on the bed, breathing hard. May drops down beside her.* Hey, listen to me. Just me.
May: *grabs her daughter’s shoulder, her knee* We can do this. You can do this. If not, then just grab her, and run like hell.
May: *shifts around in front of Skye* You will control your emotions, just like we practiced.
May: *moves away, not taking her eyes off her* Skye, look at me. Focus.
May: *reaches for the tablet, trying to project comfort and certainty* It’ll stop.
May: *places herself between the sword and Skye* Agent May, release the girl.
May: *raises her hands, ready to fight* Like hell I will. To do whatever it takes.
May: *hears a sound and turns to see Skye pointing an ICER at her own head* Skye-
May: *barely registers that the shaking has stopped. She sees another, smaller body falling and drops onto the bed, pulling her daughter into her arms.*
May: *behind her, voices- Sif’s and Phil’s.*"
3,49351855,May,Skye,"May: Skye- *barely registers that the shaking has stopped. She sees another, smaller body falling and drops onto the bed, pulling her daughter into her arms.*
May: It's okay. I'm here. I'll take care of you. *holds her daughter's head against her chest* I don't care what it takes. I'm going to protect her.

May: *gets up* She's too numb to cry. *wears Phil's t-shirts and wraps herself in his favorite blanket* It's hard to breathe. To live with the loss that sits like a stone in her chest.
May: *takes the envelope and stares at Phil's familiar neat handwriting* I've already said everything that needs to be said. But I know you, and I know that when you open this letter, you'll probably be feeling pretty low.
May: *chuckles a little and keeps laughing* Get off your ass, Melinda May, and get back to work. That's an order. *tears fill her eyes and she's sobbing, clutching the letter to her chest*

May: *doesn't look at him again while driving back to the Lighthouse* I'm going to kill him. *grits her teeth and tries to tamp down her rage, put it away for later* Always said jokingly that she'd kill Coulson."
4,49351855,May,Coulson,"May: I didn’t say that, I don’t-” *He puts his hand on her knee and waits.* “I don’t know what I want... I just…”
May: *He gently pulls her hands away from her face.* “Melinda.”
May: *She shifts closer, her knees bumping against his.* “I want to take things slowly.”
Coulson: “Okay.”
May: “I can’t rush into anything. I- I barely know what my emotions are now... I don’t even know how I feel about you now.”
Simmons: “If one of you would like to-”
Coulson: “We’ll sit with her... We can finish our conversation in there.”
May: Well the phone’s off the hook, no one knows where we are- *She pulls Coulson onto the floor, and he smiles.* Three.
May: I love you, Phil.
Coulson: Hmm, careful. Someone might hear.
May: The ocean is blue, as blue as your eyes- *She drops her head on his chest.* God, you’re incorrigible.
Coulson: I’m gonna take it with me when I go.
May: Are we running with this now?
May: Yes.
May: And always for you, and forever yours, it felt just like the old days. *Her hand tightens around his.* I want this.
Coulson: *His lips meet hers.* There’s got to be more than flesh and bone, when all that you’ve loved is all you own…
Coulson: I will never leave you again.
May: *She closes her eyes, smiling.* I know."
