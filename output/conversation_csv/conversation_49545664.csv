0,49545664,Attuma,Iktan,"Attuma: Ko’oten, nacom. K ilej wa Chaac ka Bast u séen kaxa'antbil ti' le eek'o'obo'. [Come, general. Let us see if Chaac and Bast have met in the stars.].”
Iktan: Yaan ti’ leti’ob [They have]. No other could compare. You will soon see.
Attuma: Then let us go and meet your wife, General.
Iktan: *smiles*
N’Tando: Molo, General Attuma! This is a surprise!
Attuma: *waves back* Of course! Let me get this one settled with his mother, and we can speak inside. I should warn you, though, Okoye isn’t here. She mentioned a new trail she wanted to hike, out in the thicket.
Attuma: *sighs in relief* That is fine. I did not come to speak with Okoye.
N’Tando: Well, no matter. Let us go inside."
1,49545664,Attuma,Okoye,"Attuma: I did not come to speak with Okoye.
N’Tando: Well, no matter. Let us go inside.
Attuma: So, General, what brings you here today?
Attuma: I would like to introduce you to Iktan. She is an atanzahab. A matchmaker. She has divined matches in my family for three generations.
N’Tando: It is good to meet you, Iktan. I am N’Tando, son of N’Jabulo. I imagine you must be very good at what you do to have the General’s trust.
Iktan: I do nothing but consult the gods on behalf of those who seek to join their souls eternally. But yes, I do consider myself quite good.
N’Tando: *laughs*
Iktan: *laughs*
Attuma: I have come here in hopes that we can begin the conversation to formalize Okoye and I’s courtship."
2,49545664,Attuma,Okoye,"Attuma: I realize she has been married before, but I still wished to follow tradition. It is why I brought Iktan. I was unsure of Wakandan traditions; still, I believe Okoye deserves the respect of a proper proposal. I consulted with Aneka, and she mentioned an exchange of aalak’, so I brought goats raised in a small village by the surface dwellers near Talokan. I brought other gifts as well, hand-plucked pearls, an assortment of cacao plants, and even a fertilizer that my chiich created for your squash and melon plants. *N’Tando sat back and crossed his arms, stroking his beard.* You have come to ask if you can marry Okoye.
N’Tando: You wish to marry Okoye?
Attuma: Yes. It is my belief that our destinies have been twined since the moment she spilled my blood.
N’Tando: And you… your gods… they support this?
Iktan: I should not grant my full approval until I meet your Okoye and consult the stars, but I feel the point may be moot. Attuma will likely marry her, no matter what I or the gods have to say.
Attuma: I have only brought Iktan here because it is what K’uk’ulkan and my father demanded of me. I have known Okoye was my other half from the moment she bested me in battle. I apologize if I have insulted your or Okoye’s honor by providing an improper bride price.
N’Tando: A bride price is irrelevant; if we must have one for a traditional arrangement, then fine. We can discuss it later. *He rose from the table excitedly and entered the kitchen.*
Okoye: Celebrate what?
Attuma: The General has come to ask you to be his wife!
N’Tando: Eh, andivanga [I’m sorry]? *Okoye’s amusement became perplexion as she strode to the table, glancing at Attuma and Iktan.*
N’Tando: Oh, forgive an old man, Attuma, *N’Tando tutted, pressing on despite her confusion, and set the bottle and glasses on the table.* All is well; I will still honor tradition and ask."
3,49545664,Attuma,Okoye,"Attuma: Oh, forgive an old man, Attuma, *N’Tando tutted, pressing on despite her confusion, and set the bottle and glasses on the table.* He chuckled and waved the man off, shooting father and daughter a dimpled smirk. All is well; I will still honor tradition and ask.
Okoye: What?
N’Tando: I just don’t want to ruin whatever proposal you have planned, *the elder Wakandan said amicably.*
Okoye: Proposal?! *came Okoye’s sputtered question, voice high and brows higher.*
N’Tando: Attuma, of course! *He flashed Attuma a quick grin, and Attuma bowed his head gratefully. To have his blessing was a tremendous boon.*
Okoye: And who exactly is Attuma proposing to?
N’Tando: Okoye, *her father drew out her name in a teasing reprimand.* There is no need to act as if I don’t know. I wasn’t born last rainfall, intombi. He was unsure of the proper tradition, so Attuma came to ask my blessing for your hand— which I gladly grant, *Okoye sputtered again, making an incoherent noise of confusion.*
N’Tando: Not that you need it; I know you are a grown woman. Who you marry is your choice, and I must say, the General is an excellent choice.
Attuma: Know what, Baba? Why do you think Attuma is proposing? *Okoye asked her father in a flurry.*
Okoye: Better yet, Attuma, *she turned to him, waving her father off,* why does my father think we’re getting married?
Attuma: I had thought it time, but if you are not ready, in cháak ti’ le, *he replied, shrugging,* I will wait.
Okoye: If I’m not ready– Attuma, how do you expect to marry a woman you’re not dating? *Her words stopped him short, and he reared back, confused by her question. They’d been courting for nearly a year, and he wondered if this “dating” was another peculiar practice of surface dwellers. Maybe a step between courtship and marriage.*
Attuma: Dating?
Okoye: Yes, dating! You know, where you spend time with a person? Go places, share meals, swap stories?
Attuma: Okoye, we do all of those things.
Okoye: What? No, we do not!
Attuma: In cháak ti’ le, we’ve shared three meals this past week alone. Two of them at your home.
Okoye: Yes, well, that’s not the point.
Attuma: Is it not? *He rose and rounded the table, reaching for her hand and gently squeezing her fingers.* Forgive me for my ignorance, ee’ ke ch’ujuk; I wasn’t aware there was a step between courtship and marriage.
Okoye: A step between court– Attuma, please! There is no step between courtship and marriage! We haven’t been courting! *It was his turn to look at her strangely, and he tilted his head, wondering if she’d somehow injured herself in the thicket. His eyes darted down to the cuff on her arm, the beginning overture of his courtship. One she’d accepted— as she had with all of his other offerings of affection.*"
4,49545664,Attuma,Okoye,"Attuma: There is no step between courtship and marriage! We haven’t been courting!
N’Tando: You haven’t been?
Okoye: You spend more time with him than you do anyone else! You’ll forgive me for thinking the man you brought to Isivuno was more than your training partner.
Attuma: You’ve been courting me?
Okoye: I- I don’t understand. Why didn’t you say anything?
Attuma: I did not know it required explaining, in cháak ti’ le. You’re wearing my first overture.
Okoye: This was a courting gift?
Attuma: Yes, Okoye.
Okoye: Were they all courting gifts?
Attuma: Yes, Okoye.
Okoye: What about the dagger?
Attuma: Commissioned for you.
Okoye: The suit and cloak?
Attuma: Made for you.
Okoye: The macuahuitl.
Attuma: My mother’s.
Okoye: Attuma! You gave me your mother’s weapon?
Attuma: She was a warrior, just as you are— a Nacom of Talokan for a k’atun and a half. You are more than worthy to wield it, in cháak ti’ le.
Okoye: Keep your compliments, dimples, and pet names to yourself, you oversized fish. I just- I don’t know how I didn’t see it."
5,49545664,Okoye,Attuma,"Okoye: Keep your compliments, dimples, and pet names to yourself, you oversized fish. I just- I don’t know how I didn’t see it. You did not know Attuma intended courtship, yet you accepted his overtures. Would you have accepted if you had? Yes. Then there is no need to bemoan the past, child. Are you pleased with the courtship? Well, now that I’m aware of it, I can’t say I have any complaints. Maybe a guide to Talokanil courtship practices could prove helpful since your Xook Nacom seems disinclined to explain. Asked me what?

Iktan: You did not know Attuma intended courtship, yet you accepted his overtures. Why? Would you have accepted if you had? Then there is no need to bemoan the past, child. Are you pleased with the courtship?

Attuma: Yes. I mean– Well… Yes. Asked me what? Yan! You deserve that and more! Expecting a woman to know she’s in courtship because you gave her a few pretty baubles… bah! Did Amoxtili teach you anything? Oh, but no, you probably didn’t ask her either!"
6,49545664,Okoye,Attuma,"Okoye: Did Amoxtili teach you anything? *laughs at Attuma*
Attuma: Oh, but no, you probably didn’t ask her either! *pouts at Okoye*
Okoye: It is not that funny, in cháak ti’ le. *laughs at Attuma*
Attuma: Okoye! You can’t! *gasps in terror*
Okoye: I certainly can and most assuredly will. *teasing laugh*
Okoye: We’ll be family soon anyway; it wouldn’t be right for me to hide it from my future sister-in-law.
Attuma: You mean–?
Okoye: Yes, Attuma.
Attuma: Truly? You wish to–?
Okoye: Yes, Attuma.
Attuma: Okoye…
Okoye: I know. I’m sure.
Attuma: I don’t want to rush. If you need time to think, I understand, in yakunaj.
Okoye: There’s no need to think about something I already know, sithandwa sam.
Attuma: *shared a secret smile*
N’Tando: Oh, this will be wonderful!"
7,49545664,Okoye,Lesebo,"Okoye: Just wait until I tell Lesebo; he’s going to be so excited. A wedding! You know he probably has more plans than I do, intombi. *poured them each a glass of wine, raising his glass in a quick toast* Mm, the Jabari make excellent wines, Attuma. I will ask King M’Baku if we can have some shipped down for the occasion. Will you all be wed here or Birnin Zana? Or will Talokan host? How about a joint hosting, hm? Two nations, two generals, one family— sounds good, yes? *The questions came in rapid fire, one after another, N’Tando leaving little time for answers.*
Iktan: A joint wedding would be well for all involved, preferably somewhere land and sea meet.
Okoye: A beach wedding! How perfect! Maybe tents and canopies? We could have a sushi bar and—
Okoye: We’ll get all the details sorted out. We have an entire year; that’s plenty of time to plan the wedding of your dreams.
Okoye: Because, Attuma Chich Iik’, Xook Nacom of Talokan, *standing and rounding the table to sit herself boldly in his lap* you owe me a year of proper courtship."
