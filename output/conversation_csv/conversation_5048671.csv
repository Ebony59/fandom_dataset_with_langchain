1,5048671,Halesia,Abraxas Malfoy,"Halesia: Returning to Hogwarts was weird. *Halesia was having a difficulty time adjusting back to the castle and the life as a student.*
Halesia: Monday morning found Halesia pushing her food around as she read a letter from Andromeda. *Halesia was annoyed with Andromeda and put the letter in her bag before pushing the plate away.*
Halesia: With a sigh, she turned her attention to her Charms textbook while glancing around the hall.
Headmistress McGonagall: I am pleased to announce Hogwarts has a new transfer student, *the headmistress began.*
Headmistress McGonagall: I would like to introduce Abraxas Malfoy. *At the mention of the new student's name, the hall quieted.*
Halesia: Curious, Halesia looked over at the Hufflepuff table. *Halesia was curious about the new student.*
Abraxas: *Abraxas was busy reading a textbook and eating.*"
2,5048671,Halesia,Abraxas,"Halesia: Can I borrow a quill? *glances over at Abraxas* Here, *Abraxas hands over a silver quill* Thank you. *Halesia smiles* I do need these.
Abraxas: *takes his seat*

Halesia: Here, *a voice said, pulling Halesia's attention*
Abraxas: *standing next to her* Thank you. *Abraxas hands a wrapped package to Halesia*
Halesia: *whispers* Thanks. *takes the gift* You're welcome.
Abraxas: *takes his seat*

Halesia: What are your holiday plans?
Abraxas: I'm staying here. *Abraxas replies* Mother doesn't want me around. She's not very happy with me these days since I took the Malfoy name.
Halesia: *frowns*"
3,5048671,Halesia,Abraxas,"Halesia: What are your holiday plans?
Abraxas: I'm staying here. Mother doesn't want me around. She's not very happy with me these days since I took the Malfoy name.
Halesia: That sounded horrible. What about you?
Abraxas: Staying here, too. We can spend Christmas together.
Halesia: *smiles*

...

Halesia: There weren't many students remaining at Hogwarts that year. There were thirteen in total. Halesia was one of three Gryffindors. The other two students were first years. So, Halesia found herself spending most of the break with Abraxas. Their time was divided between the library, the kitchens, and the Room of Requirements.
Abraxas: *fascinated by the Room of Requirements*
Halesia: *watches Abraxas pacing in front of the wall and the door appearing numerous times*

...

Halesia: *seated in front of the fireplace, reading a book*
Abraxas: *sits down next to Halesia, wraps an arm around her shoulders, and pulls her close*
Halesia: *looks up from her book and over at Abraxas*
Abraxas: *leans over and presses his lips against hers*
Halesia: *freezes for a second before leaping against Abraxas*

...

Abraxas: *presents Halesia with a sapphire and ivory ribbon*
Abraxas: We're courting, exclusively.
Halesia: *confused look*
Abraxas: He handed Halesia a book and left her with a kiss on the cheek.
Halesia: *dives into the book, all about pure-blood customs*

...

Halesia: *introduces Ron and Hermione to Abraxas*
Halesia: *suspects Hermione had something to do with Ron's attitude change*"
4,5048671,Halesia,Hermione,"Halesia: What are you thinking about? *eyeing her best friend*
Hermione: Good things?
Halesia: Mostly. Just about how much things have changed since – ya know – last year.

Hermione: Maybe later. *with a small smile*
Halesia: Do you want to join me and Abraxas in the library?

Halesia: Morning.
Abraxas: What troubles you, silverbell?
Halesia: Nothing important.

Abraxas: Do you want to start with Charms or Potions?


Abraxas: While Abraxas wanted a large family, he didn't think it was possible because the Malfoy family had a history of having one child, usually a son, each generation.
Halesia: For some reason, Halesia was convinced they would have multiple children, at least three."
5,5048671,Halesia,Abraxas,"Abraxas: Here, *slides a piece of parchment towards Halesia across the library table.*
Halesia: *picks up the parchment, reading it over.*

Halesia: No bloody way! *shouted Ron Weasley, his eyes wide.*
Hermione: *Next to him, equally surprised.*
Halesia: He's very serious, *explained Halesia, her cheeks turning red.*
Ron: *ran a hand through his hair, stealing a glance at his girlfriend.* Your betrothed is making me look back, mate, *he joked, sounding a little weak.*
Halesia: *shrugged, offering her friend a small smile.*
Hermione: Just remain focused, alright?
Halesia: Of course, *declared Halesia.* Abraxas had the family lawyer write the contract.
Hermione: *beamed while Ron glared at the ground.*

Halesia: *When the train pulled into King's Cross, Halesia watched as the other students departed the train and they reunited with their families. Abraxas stood next to her, his hand clutching something in his pocket.*"
6,5048671,Halesia,Abraxas,"Halesia: Silverbells, I love you, *whispered* will you marry me? *showed her the ring in his other hand.*
Halesia: Yes, *whispered* I love you, too. *She leaned in, pressing a kiss to his lips.*

Abraxas: *grabbed her wrist*"
