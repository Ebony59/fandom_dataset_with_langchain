0,5050006,Tom,Peverell,"Tom: Peverell, Heliconia.
Dumbledore: *places Sorting Hat on Heliconia's head*
Sorting Hat: Slytherin!
Peverell: *smiles and hands the Hat back to Dumbledore*
Tom: *glances behind him and meets Peverell's gaze*
Peverell: *motioning to the seat next to her*
Tom: Riddle, Tom.
Sorting Hat: Intelligent, sly, cunning, ambitious, and a thirst to prove yourself. You'll go far in Salazar's house. Best of luck in Slytherin!
Peverell: Evening, Tom. I think you'll make a model Slytherin.
...
Tom: *working his way to the top of Slytherin with Heliconia by his side*
Heliconia: *advising Tom not to go after the fifth through seventh years*
Tom: *radiating power and people flocking to his side*
Heliconia: *describing Tom as powerful, dangerous, beautiful, and mighty*
Heliconia: *describing herself as kind and sweet, but also dismissive and uninterested*
...
Heliconia: I found this and thought of you.
Tom: *scanning the book page with Heliconia*
Heliconia: *knowing Tom is researching his family*"
1,5050006,Tom,Heliconia,"Tom: Apparently, we're distant cousins. *watched the pages turn* And I think this will interest you.
Heliconia: *flipping back a few pages* The muggles outlawed it for a reason. *willing to bet it was only a matter of time before both the Crabbe and Goyle lines were extinct to Magical Britain*
Tom: *thinking* Magical Britain was filled with bigotry, prejudice, outdated bias, and bloodism.
Tom: *with Heliconia by his side* Together, they would make Magical Britain a better place for every magical-being – muggle-born, half-blood, pure-blood and magical creature.
Tom: *with a vision for the future* He would never turn to forbidden magic. *He would never learn about horcruxes, and he would never mutilate his soul.*
Tom: *thinking* All because of one girl, everything changed."
2,5050006,Tom,Heliconia,"Tom: Mine, *he stated, bringing his hand to cup her cheek. He tilted her face upwards and he leaned forward. This kiss was longer – it was soft and sweet.*
Heliconia: *She dropped her book, leaned over and pressed her lips against Tom's. It was a short kiss, simply a brush of the lips. When she pulled back, Heliconia's face was pink. She bit her lip and stared at Tom with those emerald eyes.*

Tom: *He read over her shoulder while mindlessly playing with her red hair, wrapping it around his finger and running his hands through it. These days, Tom only played with her hair in private. The sight of it drove their housemates mad with flushed faces and stuttered words.*

Tom: *He knew why. He learned when Professor Slughorn handed him a book on pure-blood customs. Only a witch's intended could play with her hair. As far as Tom was concerned, Heliconia became his intended the second she was Sorted into Slytherin, his house.*

Tom: *He would cherish and love her for all eternity.*

Tom: *He decided to put a ring on her – the ultimate form of possession. Now, everyone would know Heliconia was Tom's – and he was Heliconia's.*

Heliconia: *She knew they were destined to be together. Great things would come from their union.*"
