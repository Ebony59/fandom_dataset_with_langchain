0,5511290,Finn,Poe Dameron,"Jess: You're the Resistance's best pilot, and he's wearing your jacket. Just go talk to him!
Finn: Poe! Poe Dameron!
Finn: They fixed my jacket.
Poe: Looking good!
Snap: You gonna introduce us, boss?
Poe: Finn, this is Snap Wexley and Jessika Pava. Guys, this is Finn.
Snap: It's nice to finally meet you.
Jessika: Poe's told us so much about you.
Finn: Didn't think there was much to tell--I didn't even have a real name when we met.
Finn: Would you guys like anything to drink?
Snap: Pretty sure we can take some of those off your hands.
Finn: This one tastes nice.
Finn: Do you know someplace I could stay tonight? A couple of people have offered, but I didn't think… I don't think that's what I'm looking for.
Poe: You don't have your own quarters? Where were you staying before?
Finn: Medbay. And before that, I just slept on the Millennium Falcon. I figured I'd get assigned something, but nobody ever said anything and I--sometimes it's hard to ask.
Snap: What are we scrounging?
Poe: Someplace for Finn to stay tonight."
1,5511290,Poe,Finn,"Poe: I'm sure we can scrounge you up something.
Poe: Someplace for Finn to stay tonight.
Poe: You've got a bunch of extra space, right?
Poe: Yeah, but I'm sure Finn wants his own place to stay. We can probably find him someplace--
Finn: I don't mind. Pretty sure I've shared a room my whole life.
Poe: Somebody had to do something. Because you were lined up for those shots and you weren't taking them, and a good wingman--
Jess: I didn't need a wingman tonight, Jess.
Poe: You called him 'that cute stormtrooper' a bunch, boss. Way more than was called for, that's for sure.
Poe: He doesn't need that from me right now. He needs a friend, and that's what--
Jess: I don't think you get to decide that for him, Jess says.
Snap: She's right. I didn't hear what she just said, but whatever it was, she's right.
Poe: We'll get you set tomorrow, get you in the system, get all the stuff you need. The Resistance takes care of its own, I promise.
Finn: Thanks, Poe.
Poe: You're welcome, Finn.
Poe: Hey, Finn. Hey.
Finn: I don't--you can't--I'm not going back. You can't make me go back.
Poe: No one's going to make you go back. You're here. You're safe. You're good, Finn."
2,5511290,Poe,Finn,"Poe: --you can't--I'm not going back. You can't make me go back. *Poe drops onto the bed next to Finn and looks him in the eye.* No one's going to make you go back. You're here. You're safe. You're good, Finn. *He leans into Finn, puts an arm around his shoulder and a hand on his back until he feels Finn's breathing slow to a more reasonable rate.* BB-8 peeks out from under the blanket it'd managed to pull off the bed and whirs calmingly.
Finn: I'm good, Finn repeats. It almost sounds like he believes it.

Poe: I imagine he's all situated, *Poe answers. You'll have me all to yourself, don't worry. BB-8's response is startled, and Poe laughs. No, no, I know. I like him too.* What he finds when he gets back is Finn, still on the cot in his room, unconvincingly reading something on a datapad. Even from the doorway, Poe can tell that the contents of his closet have been disturbed. The most obvious signs of this are the things from it which are spread on his bed: a framed holo of him, his parents, and his sister, taken on Yavin 4; a box containing a number of medals he's been awarded; a container that's mostly full with homemade cookies; and an old model T-65 X-wing he's had since he was a kid. He looks at the bed and then at Finn. He asks instead: Did you have any trouble with the quartermaster?
Finn: Got a room, got a few things to put in it. Clothes, a blaster, a datapad. I didn't have any-- *He gesticulates here; whether he means to wave at the things on Poe's bed is debatable.* --any stuff. Any people stuff. Just assigned stuff. He changes the subject too quickly for Poe to respond to that. Your cookies are awful.
Poe: Snap's mom keeps sending them.
Finn: They're awful. Finn looks away, and then back up. I shouldn't have gone through your stuff, but--you're not the first person who's left. Rey left, and then you, and I didn't have any things and I started thinking about what would be left of me here if I left…
Poe: It's okay. I wouldn't have left you with my stuff if I didn't trust you with it. *He doesn't realize it's true until he's saying it, but it is--he's trusted Finn, really, since the moment Finn pulled him aside on the Star Destroyer. He's trustworthy and handsome and it looks a little like he may have raided Poe's closet for clothes too and Poe is having a little trouble handling all this.*

Finn: You should come see, Finn says, standing up from the cot and watching Poe's face carefully. Poe's curious what it is he's seeing, so he shrugs agreeably and before he knows what's happening, Finn has said come with me and has grabbed his hand and is pulling him down the corridor. There's a moment--of maybe defensiveness, maybe realization?--where Finn looks back at him and Finn's grip falters for a second, but Poe says nothing, just smiles at him. The hand-holding is unexpected, but nothing he's going to complain about. (He can hear BB-8 trailing along behind them, making inquisitive noises.) They weave through a maze of corridors. The pilots' quarters are close to the hangar, and Poe's pretty sure he's never been back this far into the base. Eventually, they stop up short in front of a door that looks identical to every other door on the hallway, and Finn doesn't drop Poe's hand to open it. When it does slide open, Poe sees a room a little smaller than his own, with a bed and a closet and chair (with the patched-up jacket slung over its back) and a table, and on the table and the floor and the wall are things: some small carved statues, a portable holochess board, some seashells."
3,5511290,Finn,Poe,"Finn: Where did you get all this? *not taking his eyes off the holo.*
Poe: You know that guy Snap knows in Supply? I went back to talk to him about when he needed the cot back, and it turns out they've got a huge pile of stuff you're allowed to have. He let me take anything I could carry. *looks around the room, raises an eyebrow.*
Finn: Well, a couple of trips-worth of what I could carry. *looks pretty smug.* I don't know if you've heard, but I'm kind of a big deal now.
Poe: *chuckles* It suits you. *steps closer to the holo.* This is great, Finn. Thanks. *stares at it, shakes his head in disbelief.* I'm so happy I could kiss you.
Finn: *appears to be studiously trying not to look at him, but otherwise...unfazed?* When I went through your stuff, I didn't see anything in there from a girlfriend.
Poe: *trying his hardest to keep his voice neutral.* Don't have a girlfriend. No boyfriend either.
Finn: *steps up to Poe and kisses him.*"
