0,5962915,Leia,Han,"Leia: Fuck you. Who said anything about getting married? Did Luke say anything about getting married? *angry tone*
Luke: Luke is not involved. *not looking up*
Han: Hey, Luke is not involved. *pointing at Leia* This is about you and me, princess.
Leia: There's not going to be a you and me. I'm going to have this baby with C-3PO.
C-3PO: Madam. *tremulous tone*"
1,5962915,Leia,Luke,"Leia: Clearly not. Aren't you worried about somebody intercepting this transmission? *Leia says. Please, if they could intercept one percent of our transmissions I'd have actual work to do and I wouldn't be wasting my time calling you.*
Luke: I don't know why you need my help. You tell Han you're having a baby, he cries, you have the baby. What part of this do you need my help with? *Luke is saying. The beard is distracting, Leia keeps wanting to laugh.*
Leia: I don't need your help, I'm asking if the Force is working properly. *Leia says. That sounds like you need my help, Luke tells her.*
Leia: I'm asking you to humor me; there's a difference. Should it feel like happy indigestion? That's what it feels like. *Leia says. I honestly have never been in a position to know if pregnancy feels like happy indigestion, Luke says.*
Leia: You're an idiot, she tells him flatly. *Leia is going to burn that stupid beard right off of his stupid face.*
Leia: Congratulations, you're going to be an uncle, and then she signs off. *Leia says. Luke shows up on a supply transport one twelve-day week later, stepping dramatically off of the freighter and flipping his hood down in the middle of the crowded flight deck.*"
2,5962915,Leia,Han,"Leia: What are you going to do when you end up in jail? Because I’m not going to waste valuable resources sending a lawyer to bail you out!
Han: I didn’t ask for a lawyer! I didn’t ask your opinion at all, in fact!
Leia: Yeah, and that’s just one of your many problems. Including delusions, apparently. There’s plenty of actual work you could be doing that would be useful, instead of galavanting off to play the charming smuggler--
Han: Galavanting?
Leia: You can smuggle on your own time. You get a dozen vacation days a year just like everybody else. But on my time, on Alliance time, you do what I tell you.
Han: First of all, you don’t technically outrank me anymore, General Organa. Second of all, in what universe have I ever gotten a dozen vacation days from this measly--
Han: What disaster’s brought him home?
Leia: Hey, kid.
Han: I almost didn’t recognize your face under that dead vole.
Leia: Hello, Luke.
Luke: Did you get shorter while I was gone, or?
Leia: I am going to suffocate you with your own cloak.
Luke: Have you told Han yet?"
3,5962915,Leia,Luke,"Leia: My only sister! Pregnant!
Leia: I am going to suffocate you with your own cloak.
Luke: Have you told Han yet?
Leia: No. It hasn't come up yet.
Luke: It's not just going to come up. Unless you're referring to vomit.
Leia: You're accusing me of having peasant humor, aren't you?
Luke: It's your gene pool too. Maybe your baby is going to look like me.
Leia: Hm!
Luke: I don't understand why you can't just tell him. It's not like space scurvy, he's definitely going to notice a baby running around in eight and a half months.
Leia: Babies don't run, idiot. Toddlers run. Babies have to be carried around like drums of protein rations.
Luke: Don't you sound excited to be a mother.
Leia: I don't have to be excited.
Leia: I don't know why you even bothered coming. Don't you have children to kidnap from their parents somewhere off in the galaxy? Who's even watching them with you here?
Luke: The kids are fine. Mara's watching them. It's fine, they always listen better to her anyway. Look, Leia, if this is about Vader--
Leia: Get your boots off of my desk."
4,5962915,Leia,Luke,"Leia: Get your boots off of my desk.
Luke: *puts his feet on the floor.*

Leia: You okay?
Han: What?
Leia: Just a dream. S'fine. Back to sleep.
Han: You go back to sleep.

Med droid: Con-Grat-U-Lations. You have tested 98% positive for pregnancy. I will amend your medical records accordingly.
Leia: That's not necessary.
Med droid: Per executive order RA-198 from the office of General Leia Organa, all medical files are to be immediately amended at time of consultation.
Leia: Ugh.
Med droid: I'm sorry. I cannot parse your meaning. Can you please repeat your response?
Leia: No, not at this time.
Med droid: Your files have been amended, General Organa. Should you wish to terminate your pregnancy, assistance will be provided by myself or another med droid."
5,5962915,Leia,Luke,"Leia: Don’t you have somewhere better to do this? Like your quarters?
Luke: My sister isn’t in my quarters. I’m visiting to see my sister. Hey, 3PO, are you still getting the weird feeling?
C-3PO: I am afraid so, Master Luke. I can’t imagine what it could be!
Luke: That’s why I’m here, bud. Weren’t you not talking to me?
Leia: I felt like I should register a complaint more formally. What is that? Why is this here? I run half of a Rebel Alliance out of this office and you’re just piling your junk on any flat surface.
Luke: It’s not junk, it’s 3PO’s peripheral nervous system.
Leia: You and me are getting married, princess.
Han: Me. What is it now?
Han: You and me are getting married, princess.
Leia: Did you tell him?
Han: He didn’t have to tell me, I have a flag on your medical records. What’s more interesting here is that you didn’t tell me, your worshipfulness.
Leia: How dare you!
Han: How dare you! I mean it. Jedi Knights can perform wedding ceremonies, can’t they?
Leia: Fuck you. Who said anything about getting married? Did Luke say anything about getting married?
Luke: Luke is not involved."
6,5962915,Han,Leia,"Han: Who said anything about getting married? Did Luke say anything about getting married?
Leia: Luke is not involved.
Han: This is about you and me, princess.
Leia: There’s not going to be a you and me.
Han: We’re doing this the right way. On Corellia, you get married before the kid.
Leia: Are you saying we’re getting married because you think it’s right?!
Han: Yes!
Leia: Get out of my office, all of you!
Han: This isn’t over.
Luke: Leia.
Leia: That goes for you and your junk, too.
Luke: Yeah, I got that."
7,5962915,Leia,Han,"Leia: What was that, *kicks off her boots and begins to unlace the front of her jacket.*
Han: *spits into the sink* You look tired.
Leia: I wonder whose fault that is, *peeling off her pants and then crawling across the bed.* Maybe the idiot who ambushed me in my office and told half the base that I was pregnant? Maybe they’re responsible for the subsequent five hours I spent having my hand shaken by every rear admiral, captain, and commander that I came across? The petty officers just saluted.
Han: *sticks his mouth under the faucet, gargles, and spits.* Maybe if I hadn’t found out from a tap on a med droid, I’d’ve been a little more friendly.
Leia: I can’t believe you hacked my medical records, *tells him.* It’s such an incredible waste of time; I’m never sick.
Han: *holds his hand over the light switch.* You need anything in here?
Leia: No, *peeling off her pants and then crawling across the bed.* If you’d taken half a second to think it through before barging into my office, maybe you would have realized that you running off deliberately against my orders didn’t exactly fill me with enthusiasm to raise helpless and dependent offspring with you.
Han: *stops in the middle of the floor between the bed and the bathroom, arms full of clothes.* Helpless and dependent? Against orders?
Leia: I told you not to go with the supply freighter. It was a stupid move and you know it. How close did you get to being arrested?
Han: I didn’t even have time to land on Gan Moradir before I got the transmission from my tap, *says.* But that’s not the point. I’m not here to listen to your orders, princess.
Leia: Everybody is here to listen to my orders, *says.* That’s the point of being a goddamn general.
Han: Nice try, *says.* You don’t outrank me.
Leia: Technically--
Han: --technically we’re the same rank, *interrupts, sliding into the bed behind her.* Maybe I don’t have the blue blood, but on this base, we’re the same rank. You do me the courtesy of not barking orders, I’ll do you the courtesy of maybe listening.
Leia: You’re such an asshole, *says.*
Han: Deal? *asks.* Do you want to take your hair down?
Leia: It’s fine for now, *says.* And no deal. How about you do me the courtesy of not flagrantly breaking laws for an adrenaline rush and I’ll stop telling the flight deck to ground the Falcon.
Han: That’s not a compromise, *says into her hair.* Her hand comes up to hold both of his, between her breasts and warm under the covers. The Force-feeling of riotous indigestion feels better than it has in a few days; probably it’s because the bed is so warm with Han there."
8,5962915,Han,Leia,"Han: That’s not a compromise. *says into her hair* And the marriage discussion hasn’t been tabled, sweetheart.
Leia: Call me sweetheart in that tone of voice one more time. *threatens sleepily*

Luke: Are you even paying attention?
Leia: What?
Luke: This mission will have me off-world for fifteen days. *over-enunciates prissily* Do you promise not to lose your temper at Han while I’m gone?
Leia: What is this, primary school? *says distractedly* No, I do not promise. Take him with you if you’re that worried.
Luke: I can’t, because he’s refusing to leave.
Leia: More repairs on the Falcon?
Luke: No, he’s refusing to leave.
Leia: I heard you. *says right back* I’m pregnant, not deaf.

General Kenobi: Her name was Padmé Naberrie.
Leia: Who? *and then* Winter! Not past the trees!
Winter: You’re not Mom.
Leia: You’re gonna wish Mom was here after Nanny Phillotrix is done with you."
9,5962915,Leia,Winter,"Leia: Who? *asks*
Leia: Winter! Not past the trees! *yells*
Winter: You're not Mom. *shrieks*
Leia: You're gonna wish Mom was here after Nanny Phillotrix is done with you. *yells back*
General Kenobi: Your mother.
Leia: What about her?
Leia: Really? How did you know her?
General Kenobi: She was a senator.
Leia: It's my probationary session. It's a little premature to be calling me a senator just yet.
General Kenobi: I don't think so.
Leia: Well, let's hope everybody else feels that way.
Leia: You better not have snuck out beyond the trees! *yells towards the lake*
Leia: Was she really a senator?
General Kenobi: Yes.
General Kenobi: She had--hair. Like yours. She had been queen of Naboo for two terms and she knew how to use costuming to her advantage.
Leia: She had hair.
Leia: Naboo? Wow. I've seen pictures, of course, but I've never visited--it's supposed to be really beautiful. Idyllic, I think Dad said."
10,5962915,Leia,General Kenobi,"Leia: I want to talk to you, *Leia says flatly*, Naboo? Wow. I’ve seen pictures, of course, but I’ve never visited--it’s supposed to be really beautiful. Idyllic, I think Dad said.
General Kenobi: *General Kenobi stops looking at Leia and squints at the mountains around them, wagging his head back and forth slowly.* He’s probably making some kind of subtle point about Alderaan and the queen’s palace, but Leia ignores this. “How did she die?”
General Kenobi: “Complications.”
Leia: “With the pregnancy?”
General Kenobi: “With her husband.”
Leia: Oh.
General Kenobi: “She was, in many ways, similar to your father,” General Kenobi says. “She and Bail were extremely dedicated to the ideals upon which the Republic’s Senate was originally constructed. When it became clear that these ideals had been poisoned by the Supreme Chancellor, they were instrumental in establishing a resistance.” He looks as though he is aging in front of Leia’s eyes; there are streaks of grey running through his beard, now, the skin around his blue eyes wrinkling in the corners. “I imagine she would have loved you very much,” he says. “She certainly did before you were born.”
Leia: *Leia’s oh is inaudible; she can barely breathe.* “Why are you telling me this?” she finally manages. “I have parents. They love me and have taken care of me all of my life.”
General Kenobi: “I would hope that they have,” General Kenobi says. “It was my choice to bring you here, after all.” He pauses, maybe because he can tell that Leia is feeling alarmingly light-headed. “It would mean a great deal to your mother that you are happy. As the person who took you from her arms and brought you here, I feel similarly responsible for your happiness.”
Leia: “General Kenobi--”
General Kenobi: “Please,” he says, “I would like it if you were to call me Ben, Leia.”
Han: *The heat of the summer sun becomes suddenly, incredibly unbearable and Leia has to squeeze her eyes shut.* She jerks them open with an extremely unpleasant lurch to find Han holding her by both of her shoulders. “Hey,” he says. “What the hell was that?” It takes Leia an embarrassingly long time to realize that she’s crying, which is why Han looks like he’s been ambushed by betrayed trading partners. “Leia? Shit, hey, come on.”
Leia: *Leia rolls over and buries her head in his shoulder so she doesn’t have to look at it, the tears leaking out of her like a broken faucet.* She’s making some kind of hideous droning noise.
Han: “Hey,” Han is saying repeatedly, irritatingly. “Leia, it’s okay. Okay? It’s okay.”
Leia: I want to talk to you, *Leia says flatly*, Naboo? Wow. I’ve seen pictures, of course, but I’ve never visited--it’s supposed to be really beautiful. Idyllic, I think Dad said.
General Kenobi: *General Kenobi stops looking at Leia and squints at the mountains around them, wagging his head back and forth slowly.* He’s probably making some kind of subtle point about Alderaan and the queen’s palace, but Leia ignores this. “How did she die?”

11,5962915,Leia,Han,"Leia: Good, *immediately plugging the memory stick into the side of her datapad* You're dismissed. Go get some supper.
Leia: *looks at the quiet, serious face of the handmaiden Padmé* Ma'am? *somebody says; Leia looks up to see Admiral Olivares leaning through the doorway to her office* We've got a situation.
Leia: I'll be right there, *rips the memory stick out of her datapad, already stepping around her desk in a half-sprint* Brief me as we go, admiral.

Leia: My parents had an arranged marriage, *says flatly when Han says something along the lines of not all of us had crowns growing up, princess in the middle of some kind of execrable story about his parents and his childhood* This fairy tale stuff you're dribbling about sounds nice or whatever but it's nonsensical.
Han: Nonsensical, *yelps* what's that supposed to mean?
Leia: Full of nonsense, *informs him* Look, I don't understand why you want to get married at all. People get married because it helps with taxes, and we're technically criminals. I haven't filed a tax return since Vader destroyed my home planet.
Han: Taxes? *incredulously* Who gets married for taxes?
Leia: Everybody! *says*
Han: *swivels around and says to Luke* Why did your parents get married?
Luke: My grandfather married my grandmother to free her from slavery, *says*
Leia: Are these the grandparents we share?"
12,5962915,Han,Leia,"Han: It’s cute how he thinks Leia won’t notice that his bottles of WD-40 appear to be reproducing.
Han: Okay, that sounds better than taxes, I guess.
Leia: Are these the grandparents we share?
Luke: We share all of our grandparents, Leia, that’s how being co-zygotes work.
Leia: We weren’t the same zygote, idiot.
Luke: I said co-zygotes.
Han: Even moisture farmers on a junkyard asteroid belter like Tatooine get married for better reasons that taxes, princess.
Luke: Junkyard?
Leia: Taxes are a perfectly legitimate reason for marriage and—I would like to add—not the reason my parents were married. Although I fail to see why my parents have anything to do with us, since they’re dead and we’re not getting married.
Han: Look, we’re having this baby? Okay. We’re having this baby. But the baby is coming into a family.
Leia: Yes. Family. What’s the problem here? If you want more people, I hate to break it to you, but the entire rest of my family was evaporated into space and half of yours are in jail. So it’s the three of us, fine. Why do we need a marriage certificate? There’s not a House of Organa anymore so the point of inheritance is moot.
Han: It’s not half of my family that’s in jail.
Leia: Fine, forty-five percent, whatever, the point still stands. You’ve yet to make a compelling case, General Solo, and you’re wasting my valuable time.
Han: Is it not enough that I want to get married?
Leia: Not if you won’t tell me why. And don’t throw around more of that ‘it’s the right thing to do’ malarkey. I’m going to believe you’re selling me on the right thing to do the day that those Ren dickheads muster an attack force more destructive than a flock of can-cells.
Han: How come it’s a noble sentiment if you say it and malarkey coming from me?
Leia: Because I’m not an itinerant moon jockey with more charge in my blaster than sense in my brain.
Han: Okay, itinerant moon jockey, no sense, can’t keep planet-side for more than a month--is this sounding right?
Leia: For the first time, yes."
13,5962915,Han,Leia,"Han: moon jockey with more charge in my blaster than sense in my brain.
Leia: Okay.
Han: Itinerant moon jockey, no sense, can’t keep planet-side for more than a month--is this sounding right?
Leia: For the first time, yes.
Han: You like that I go off-planet and get out of your hair.
Leia: I’m not going to like that if there’s a baby here that needs taking care of. And the issue is when you ignore a direct order to go off and pursue your own criminal agenda.
Han: You literally just said that we’re all criminals. Never mind that. Princess, I think the problem here isn’t that you don’t see the point of marriage, it’s that you don’t trust me. *Kicking his boots up onto the side of her desk, Han interlaces his fingers and rests them on his stomach.* What, are you too good for a Corellian scoundrel?
Luke: I think it’s more complicated than that.
Han: Shut up, Luke. *His tone is almost pleasant.* You’ve been running your own little rebel dictatorship for a while here, princess, and I think you’ve gotten used to getting what you want. You can talk big game about diplomacy but you’re shit at it. You’re real good at telling people what to do and expecting them to listen. But guess what? You can’t tell me what to do.
Leia: I could court martial you.
Han: Go ahead. You’re shitty at diplomacy because you don’t know how to compromise, princess.
Leia: Oh, for fuck’s sake, not this again.
Han: No, no, I’ve been thinking about this and I’m pretty sure this is true. I’ve made all of the compromises--I joined your stupid rebellion, I let myself be stuck in carbonite--
Leia: You let yourself?
Han: --and I’ve jumped from shit planet to shit planet for the last six years to help train your air force. I’m not seeing a lot of compromising from your end, your worshipfulness.
Leia: I haven’t throttled you yet.
Han: I really think that it’s time that you made some compromises here, too. If you actually objected to having this kid, you’d’ve had a med droid terminate it and this wouldn’t be up for discussion. But you want the kid. Do you want me around?
Leia: Do I get a choice?
Han: Don’t play that. Either you think I’ll stick around or you don’t.
Leia: Han, every day with you brings new and unpleasant surprises.
Han: I’m going to stick around. At this point, princess, it wouldn’t be worth the effort to leave. I love you, I want to get married, I want this kid. Okay?
Leia: Wow, I’m overwhelmed by the strength of your feelings. Well, if it wouldn’t be worth the effort to leave, why don’t we just get married tomorrow?"
14,5962915,Leia,Han,"Leia: It wouldn’t be worth the effort to leave. I love you, I want to get married, I want this kid. Okay?
Han: Okay? It’s unbelievable that Leia is in love with this idiot.
Leia: Wow. I’m overwhelmed by the strength of your feelings. Well, if it wouldn’t be worth the effort to leave, why don’t we just get married tomorrow?
Han: Stop nitpicking what I say and actually listen, will you.
Leia: Ugh. Fine. We’ll get married.
Han: I knew it. I knew you’d marry me.
Leia: You’re an idiot.
Han: I know."
