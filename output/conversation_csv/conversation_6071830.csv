0,6071830,Tamamo,Vlad,"Tamamo: Are you going to ask me for my real name?
Vlad: I'm not sure why I need to.
Tamamo: After all, your real name is what you want it to be, is it not?
Tamamo: You seem like the type who has nothing to hide, yet you're hiding something. That regal attitude can't fool me.
Vlad: You're one to talk. And you would say you have nothing to hide yourself, do you, Caster?
Tamamo: That's no way to talk to a lady!
Vlad: Hm, so you can vocalize your impression of me, but I can't?
Tamamo: I want to talk to you to fix those very impressions. Besides, I've never had a chance to talk to someone who lived out of Japan. Tell me, how was the western world like from when you lived? Is everyone truly ruled by Mongols?
Vlad: You have a strange impression of the world.
Tamamo: That's an answer in itself, but please give me a straightforward explanation! Tell me about yourself, as a little ice-breaker. How'd you become a Heroic Spirit?
Vlad: Very well."
1,6071830,Tamamo,Vlad,"Tamamo: That’s an answer in itself, but please give me a straightforward explanation! Tell me about yourself, as a little ice-breaker. How’d you become a Heroic Spirit?
Vlad: Very well, *turns his head down to face her*.
Tamamo: *notices his hollow eyes* Maybe Tamamo’s used to that kind of character.
Vlad: *surrounded by a grand air* Who told you that?
Tamamo: *opens her mouth* ...Frankenstein.
Vlad: *laughs*"
2,6071830,Tamamo,Vlad,"Tamamo: So, what do you think of her? She has an Arts Noble Phantasm too, so we'll most likely have to fight on the same team, no?
Vlad: She is not what I expected her to be.
Tamamo: I don't like her already.
Vlad: Why is that?
Tamamo: Because she said Hakuno was her previous master, but she was mine!
Vlad: *reaches out to pat Tamamo on the head*
Tamamo: What are you doing? I don't need to become even shorter compared to you!
Vlad: You are... even shorter than you look.

---

Nero: So, when does the legend stop, and the person begin?
Nero: That is a fallacy. You are assuming that the masses will ever care about the person over the legend they leave!

---

Carmilla: I mean, nobody told me! Nobody ever told me this was all a mistake! That's why I ended up like this! Ah, my true name is... Elizabeth Bathory!

---

Tamamo: You need to work with her, she's an offensive Caster. If you want her to be strong, just summon her as a Berserker! Why, oh why do I have to deal with her? An entitled girl with nothing to her name but a rotten heart, who can't even accept what she's done!

---

Tamamo: I'll leave now, so please just forget all about me.

---

Tamamo: So, what do you think of her? She has an Arts Noble Phantasm too, so we'll most likely have to fight on the same team, no?"
3,6071830,Tamamo,Carmilla,"Tamamo: You are a monster.
Carmilla: What? Is that how you normally treat allies?
Tamamo: It is true, you are a noblewoman... But since I am a fox casted from the court, there is nothing to hold me back now. You are nothing but a beast, taking pleasure in the pain of your victims! You know you are doing wrong, and have casted away the shackles of ignorance, yet you do not stop!
Carmilla: And what gives you the right to say any of this? I am a bureaucrat, but you are nothing but a fox! I am a monster, you say, but how else could I have ended up when nobody tried to stop me, not until the very end?
Tamamo: If you truly had the pride of a bureaucrat, you would still change now! You would still change, even after your first life! To say you have already come to an end is an excuse! You are a wicked woman who pursues nothing but her own self-interest. No, I do not wish to fight alongside you! I demand to be put in another team! Even one with Elizabeth Bathory!
Carmilla: And you think the idiotic girl that shares my name is any better than me?
Tamamo: You don’t deserve any name other than Carmilla.
Vlad: Enough.
Nero: ...I miss old gladiator battles. And I’ve never seen one between two beautiful girls!
Vlad: We’re returning to Chaldea Gate, right, master?
Master: *nods very quickly*"
4,6071830,Tamamo,Vlad,"Tamamo: Ah, it’s you. Sorry about that, I--
Vlad: You don’t have to speak to me.
Tamamo: Hm? What?
Vlad: So, *opens up the door next to him* You, too, see me that way.
Tamamo: --Vlad? *the door closes behind him* What do you mean by that? Come out here and explain yourself! Don’t sulk inside like a child!
Tamamo: Fine, if you’re going to be that way, I’ll just ask master to force the door open.
Tamamo: Honestly, all you men are hopeless!
Kintoki: Hey, that’s not so nice…
Tamamo: Oh, it’s you, Kintoki. What is it?
Tamamo: You know, *takes the canned drink* The machine can just be opened without paying money. We could ask our master for the key. It’s not like anyone checks it nowadays, just restocks without looking.
Kintoki: But who’s gonna pay for the drink? *shakes his head* Hey, hey, I’m swimming in gold! I don’t need to steal.
Tamamo: It’s barely stealing, when it’s only a bit more than a dollar…
Tamamo: Right, so… Carmilla,"
5,6071830,Nero,Vlad,"Nero: Vlaaad! *clears her throat* ...Voivode of Wallachia! I request an audience at one!
Vlad: *no response*
Nero: ...Voivode?
Vlad: *no response*
Nero: THE EMPEROR OF ROME WISHES TO REQUEST AN AUDIENCE!
Vlad: *silence*
Nero: Can you hear me? I specifically came to visit you first! I know you’re in there, the door’s locked, so open up! Huff… uuu… open up…
Vlad: *opens the door*
Nero: There you are! Took you long enough!
Vlad: What could you possibly want to talk to me about?"
6,6071830,Vlad,Nero,"Vlad: What could you possibly want to talk to me about?
Nero: Well, your Empress has noticed your plight. ...You were sulking all the way here.
Vlad: Did Tamamo tell you to visit me?
Nero: Hm? No, of course not! I won’t be ordered around by her! ...I don’t hate her, though. Don’t get me wrong! We’re harsh rivals, but nothing close to how Tamamo barked at Carmilla today. What happened?
Nero: ...Shouldn’t this be a question that only Tamamo can answer?
Nero: Don’t you two know each other well? Master said you’ve both been here from the start. The fight threatens the harmony of Chaldea Gate! And you must know it too, otherwise you wouldn’t be sulking like this!
Vlad: I have no interest in petty conflicts.
Nero: That’s a foolish answer. With or without a country to rule, petty conflicts like there always escalate when placed in the hands of the powerful.
Vlad: So, as all my Roman citizens, everyone in Chaldea Gate must coexis--
Vlad: I am not a Roman citizen. I have no such amicable connections, blood or otherwise, to whatever the Ottomans have touched.
Nero: Roman citizen or not, tell me what is the cause of this problem!
Vlad: Tamamo thinks Carmilla is a monster... It must be from the deeds she’s committed in her life.
Nero: Umu. Are you sulking here, then, because you think you have been responsible for similar deeds?
Vlad: I accept what I have done before, but I am not like the Blood Countess. I am the Voivode of Wallachia.
Nero: What else could you possibly have been?
Vlad: The same as what you could’ve been."
7,6071830,Kintoki,Frankenstein,"Kintoki: Yo! Fran! *waves to Frankenstein on the way to Vlad's room*
Frankenstein: *looks up and gives a grunt in return*
Kintoki: *There are flowers in her hands, pink roses all wrapped into a veil-- their master has been busy, chasing down chocolate servants to get everyone's sweets back, but they haven't neglected their first female Berserker, or forgotten the flowers she likes to pick.*
Frankenstein: *This time, at least, she doesn't rip them to pieces anymore. That's progress.*
Tamamo: *gives Frankenstein another glance, realized she hasn't done so ever since this place got so crowded.* You know, I could never understand what she was saying..."
8,6071830,Tamamo,Kintoki,"Tamamo: You know, I could never understand what she was saying. I only guess from her grunts and hand signals. She seemed to know Vlad, and that was the reason I even noticed her. How do you talk to her so fluidly?
Kintoki: Eh? It's easy. You just gotta hear her tone and watch how her mouth is moving! Look at her golden smile!
Tamamo: You have more patience than me, my dear. You tend to be terrible with women, and yet, you seem to handle the Berserkers without a hitch. Even that Berserker tail of mine. Is it a Berserker thing? A shared language from Mad Enhancement?
Kintoki: ...Er, no. I just knew someone like that a long time ago, I guess.
Tamamo: Oh, this sounds interesting. Who was it? Was it someone I know? Oh, Kiyohime's been good friends with me since we were penpals, I'll ask--
Kintoki: Wait, wait, wait! Shuten-doji. She was... Shuten-doji.
Tamamo: I've spoken to her. I didn't think you were the cunning type, but now that you mention it, you are very good with people, Kintoki. I suppose it would be easy to know how to trick them, especially if you needed to.
Kintoki: *stops dead in his tracks*
Tamamo: Kintoki? What's the matter?
Kintoki: No, nothing. You're right. I did that.
Tamamo: Oh! You're crying! You're actually crying!
Kintoki: No! I'm not crying! I-I'm fine! Peachy! I'm golden!
Tamamo: I'm so sorry. I didn't mean to make my poor Kintoki cry.
Tamamo: Just because you want to help others doesn't mean you have to forgo any help yourself. The only time I've seen you cry is when I yelled at you for messing up my tail, so this must be serious. Tell me, then, what's the matter?
Kintoki: *sneezes into the handkerchief*"
9,6071830,Tamamo,Kintoki,"Tamamo: Just because you want to help others doesn’t mean you have to forgo any help yourself. The only time I’ve seen you cry is when I yelled at you for messing up my tail, so this must be serious. Tell me, then, what’s the matter?
Kintoki: *sneezes into the handkerchief* ...Right, it’s okay, he can keep it, he doesn’t need to return it. “...I… you’re right! I tricked her! What am I doing here?!”
Tamamo: *gives Kintoki a hard pat on the back* “What do you mean by that?”
Kintoki: “B-being a Heroic spirit and all that… how can I call myself that when I used trickery to get to her?!”
Tamamo: “Because history remembered you as a hero. That’s more than most of us can ask for.”
Kintoki: “But I’m not one! Not for that, never for that, you know! It’s wrong!”
Tamamo: “Even if you say that-- you are summoned off your heroic legends. You are a hero now. You have a place here.”
Kintoki: *chokes, closer to another spout of tears than he’d like to admit* “I’m sorry I brought it up specifically. I just… never thought you would’ve been able to do that, when I met you the first time.”
Tamamo: *continues patting Kintoki’s back* “Well, in all honesty, I never knew her too well. We are simply linked by our shared notoriety. I’ve heard that she is the king of ogres, a ruthless monster who had her eyes set on the capital.”
Kintoki: “That’s wrong.”
Tamamo: “Then tell me the right one.”
Kintoki: *asks* “Snniff… what else do you know about Shuten-doji…?”
Tamamo: *answers* “Well, in all honesty, I never knew her too well. We are simply linked by our shared notoriety. I’ve heard that she is the king of ogres, a ruthless monster who had her eyes set on the capital.”
Kintoki: “That’s wrong.”
Tamamo: “Then tell me the right one.”

Vlad: “Make a guess…” Vlad closes his eyes, before smirking. “No, you didn’t come from a time of war. You are too innocent.”
Tamamo: *raises an eyebrow* “Me? Innocent?”
Vlad: “You are not naive, even if you pretend to be. But you are still idealistic, almost simple-minded,” Vlad continues, and Tamamo tries not to look offended. “Don’t take me the wrong way. However, you do not seem to be a Heroic Spirit of a warrior or a general. You are much more of a follower than a leader. You complain and have occasional words of wisdom, but you never seem to try changing things, or convincing our master to. Not to mention, you are a Caster. You are more likely to be an artist than a warlord.”
Tamamo: “I didn’t know you had such a low opinion of me.”
Vlad: “No, you are simply a spectacularly normal person. I do not think you are the type to have a grand tale behind you, especially in a war, though I could always be wrong.”
Tamamo: *looks away* “I suppose you’re right. No, I haven’t conquered any countries, or seen war. ...But don’t think for a second I am completely innocent.”
Vlad: “I never did,” Vlad replies. “But if you can ask me questions, then I can as well. How did you end up in a fight with Okita and Nobunaga?”
Tamamo: *mutters, still averting her gaze* “Ah, that,” Tamamo mutters, still averting her gaze. “Well, you see…”

Okita: *has a routine* Okita has a routine. Nobunaga does not. She wakes up on the morning, right on the dot of 8am. Okita gets dressed, grabs her sword, and starts training. If she’s sent on an emergency battle, she’ll be warmed-up and ready. Even if she isn’t..."
10,6071830,Okita,Caster,"Okita: Have you been showed up?
Caster: Ah… perhaps. Have you seen a short girl with a musket? The Demon Archer?
Okita: She should be here by now. Where do you think she might’ve gone?
Caster: You know that’s an impossible question with a girl like her. She’s always out and about. How about you go look for her, instead? Perhaps she’s forgotten.
Okita: Ah, right… You… My weak constitution might act up. I’d rather stay put.
Caster: *nods understandably*"
11,6071830,Okita,Caster,"Okita: What’s the matter?
Caster: You… My weak constitution might act up. I’d rather stay put.
Okita: Ah, but it’s not so bad! If I get a bout of it in battle, I tend to get critical hits more often the strike after that. It’s my body’s way of making for it.
Caster: So your illness could make you stronger.
Okita: Ah? I’m not sure, myself… maybe it’s because people remember my skill in life because I was sicker than the rest.
Caster: Oh, I see. Our skills are based off our legends, after all.
Okita: And what legends do you have, Caster?
Caster: Well, you may have been able to guess, I come from the Land of the Rising Sun as well! I am skilled in the arts of magic and mystery. In fact, I am surrounded in it! So, it should be no surprise that the humans in my time, afraid of what they do not understand, would hunt me down.
Okita: That sounds horrible. And they chased you down, just like that?
Caster: But, as someone who fought in a futile war, I suppose you can understand what I mean, Okita.
Okita: ...Futile? Ah, what do you know about it? Did you live to see the end of the Edo era?
Caster: No, but this isn’t my first Holy Grail War either. All wars, in the end, are fought with more zest than they are worth. In your case, as with mine, people are scared of change.
Okita: I didn’t realize loyalty to the Shogunate would be interpreted as fear in the future."
12,6071830,Okita,Caster,"Okita: “I didn’t realize loyalty to the Shogunate would be interpreted as fear in the future.”
Caster: “Well, such blind loyalty is what doomed the both of us.”
Okita: “Don’t you dare,” *draws her sword and thrusts it across the table* “...There you are, Nobu. Where were you?”
Nobunaga: “A warrior’s pride can never be questioned, I see! Put your sword down, though. That’s no way to treat an ally.”
Okita: “...There you are, Nobu. Where were you?”
Nobunaga: “I was going fox-hunting,” *aims her gun at Caster*
Caster: ”Stop, stop! Didn’t you just tell Okita you shouldn’t treat a guest like this?! Don’t tell me you’re joining forces with that Robin Hood to skin me for my fur!”
Nobunaga: “I’m a warlord, but I’m also a diplomat. I’ve shared a table with the strongest men in Japan. I’ve had almost half of them pull a sword out on me. I’ve had people joining my dinners with the intention of killing me, and every single one of my guests have had something to hide.”
Caster: *stands her ground* “Wait! How did you--”
Nobunaga: “Haha! From my brilliant deductions! Really, though, you make it pretty obvious,”
Okita: “Tamamo-no-Mae…? Do you mean, the evil fox spirit who seduced the Heian court, and inflicted Emperor Konoe with a grave illness that killed him when he was seventeen?”"
13,6071830,Nobunaga,Okita,"Nobunaga: Really, though, you make it pretty obvious, *Nobunaga admits.*
Okita: *takes a while to recognize that name, but when she does, she immediately backs away from her, pulling her sword out again.* Tamamo-no-Mae…? Do you mean, the evil fox spirit who seduced the Heian court, and inflicted Emperor Konoe with a grave illness that killed him when he was seventeen? Whose actions eventually caused the Hogen Rebellion, and then the Genpei War?
Tamamo: *calls out her ofuda, ready to defend if any of the two make another move.* So what about it? I did nothing to wrong you two, unless you count unintentional offense as something worth shooting me over!
Nobunaga: Youkai, I have the upper hand in any fight between us. I’ve had an upper hand the moment I stepped into this room. So if you’re planning anything against our master, you’ll learn what anti-divine really means.
Okita: *taking a stance.* We share one single master. Unlike other wars, there’s no reason to hide our names. We need to know each other’s weaknesses to fight together. So, to intentionally refuse to say your name… it’s a bit suspicious.
Nobunaga: You’re a smart girl, Tamamo. You should understand! You’re a powerful servant, reaching up to Okita’s skill under this master of ours, and you’ve got a whole legend about killing the one person you were supposed to serve. You intentionally hid your name, knowing there were others with even worse tales, yet choosing to mask your own. Now, what does that sound like to us?
Tamamo: *flicks her arm and smacks an ofuda against Nobunaga’s face, making it explode.*
Okita: *knocking Tamamo to the ground with the blunt end of her sword.* Nobu!
Nobunaga: Ow, ow, *whines, before touching the new mark on her face and laughing.* Bahaha! Did my accusation hit too close to home?
Tamamo: I would never raise a hand against our master, *spits, pushing herself up to her knees.*
Nobunaga: *places a hand on Okita’s shoulder with a kind of gentleness Okita did not expect her to have.* Alright, I’ll believe you. If you tell me why you had to hide your name in the first place.
Tamamo: You would think it as a horrible reason, for you are someone who sees no value in sentiment or humanity, *answers after a while.*
Nobunaga: Ouch, I’m hurt. And are you any different from me?
Tamamo: *has nothing to say.*
Nobunaga: *steps back, putting a hand on Okita’s shoulder.* It’s a lot different than her."
14,6071830,Tamamo,Nobunaga,"Tamamo: who sees no value in sentiment or humanity.
Nobunaga: Ouch, I'm hurt. And are you any different from me?
Tamamo: Yes.
Nobunaga: Is it better to be any different?
Tamamo: *has nothing to say*
Nobunaga: *steps back, putting a hand on Okita's shoulder*
Okita: I'm going to let you off, since you didn't try to kill us outright, and because I know you're a relatively good girl. You're actually pretty boring. But the both of us are never going to be seen as heroes like Okita here. Why not embrace your darker legends? Maybe you'd be a better class than a Caster, for one.
Tamamo: I would never. That would mean giving up who I am.
Okita: This has gone on long enough. Nobu might want to let you go, but you're not going anywhere. I'm bringing you straight to master. If you have nothing to hide, we can talk things out then, yes?
Tamamo: I'm sorry, but I can't. You see, I promised to meet up with my teammate right after this. It'd be rude if I simply didn't turn up.
Okita: I'm sure they'd understand. If only you'd just said your name earlier--
Frankenstein: *breaks the floor*
Okita: *screams*
Nobunaga: *catches Okita*
Tamamo: *kind of just stares*
Frankenstein: ...No. Mas...ter. Don't... li...ke. Fight. ...Don't.
Okita: *tries fumbling for her sword*
Nobunaga: Got it, got it. It was just a friendly demonstration. Okita here just doesn't know when to quit, see?
Tamamo: *drops her arms down to her sides and tucks her ofudas back into her clothes*
Nobunaga: *pats Okita on the back*
Frankenstein: ...Thank you, I suppose. They were really driving me up the wall!
Frankenstein: Vuh... lad.
Tamamo: Hm?
Frankenstein: See... you. Sent... me. Go... see.
Tamamo: Oh, yes, I'm supposed to meet Vlad."
15,6071830,Tamamo,Vlad,"Tamamo: See... you. Sent... me. Go... see.
Tamamo: Oh, yes, I'm supposed to meet Vlad. You are... Fran, correct?
Tamamo: Did you know Vlad from before?
Tamamo: We need to talk about battle strategies! We're going to be facing much stronger enemies soon, and the master wants to put Kaleidoscope on him so he'd be able to pull off his Noble Phantasm much more quickly. We must plan around that.
Tamamo: What? What did you say?
Frankenstein: Hates! ...It.
Tamamo: He... hates it? Hates... his Noble Phantasm?
Tamamo: I can understand that feeling.
Tamamo: Should I be worried?
Tamamo: No, I'm not planning anything. Honestly!
Tamamo: This was meant to be a meeting of strategy. Yet, when you walked into the room, you immediately asked me if I had any secrets to hide. Someone told you something.
Tamamo: Nothing incriminating, I assure you.
Tamamo: You seem like the type who has nothing to hide, yet you're hiding something. So, I asked you: what else could you ever have been? Other than the Prince of Wallachia.
Vlad: The Prince of Wallachia did not suck anyone's blood.
Tamamo: Wait! My real name."
16,6071830,Tamamo,Tamamo-no-Mae,"Tamamo: Wait! My real name is Tamamo-no-Mae. But you-- no, everyone can call me Tamamo. I will tell everyone this. Everyone can know my real name!
Vlad: So, are you going to ask me for my real name?
Tamamo: I'm not sure why I need to. After all, your real name is what you want it to be, is it not?
Vlad: You... You give yourself different treatment than everyone else.
Tamamo: Of course! I should give myself preferential treatment. You really are innocent.
Tamamo: After hearing my name, most people call me a monster, you know?

Shuten-doji: *no engagement*

Nero: You could have become an Emperor, but you lost the fight on the way there?!
Vlad: No.
Nero: *no engagement*

Kintoki: Right, that's me! Sakata Kintoki, the golden boy!
Nero: A perfect title! You have monstrous strength, but also a hidden kindness. You would be perfect as my gladiator.
Tamamo: Excuse me, but please don't try to recruit Kintoki into your violent brawls. Besides, you won't find much about him in terms of wits."
17,6071830,Tamamo,Kintoki,"Tamamo: “Excuse me, but please don’t try to recruit Kintoki into your violent brawls. Besides, you won’t find much about him in terms of wits.”
Kintoki: “Wait! But we’re here for you, Vlad!”
Tamamo: “You asked me, a long time ago, if I was going to ask you for your real name. But of course, I would never. Not when I haven’t given you my real name.”
Vlad: “What do you--”
Tamamo: “My real name was Mizukume. I was never called Tamamo-no-Mae in my life. I was given that name by storytellers in the future, wanting to spread the story of an evil fox spirit, who killed hundreds at a time and brought the end of an era. Would you call me a monster?”
Vlad: “No, I would not.”
Tamamo: “Then why would you ever assume I think of you as a monster, Vlad?”
Tamamo: “You try to pretend it doesn’t bother you, and that you’ve embraced it completely. This isn’t my first Grail War, and neither is it yours. Frankenstein might not be completely wrong when she said you hated your Noble Phantasm. I know how it’s like to have your life twisted beyond recognition.”
Tamamo: “It’s true, I hid my name for a while. I wasn’t very good at it, though, which is how the Demon Archer found out so quickly… but think of it this way. Tamamo is the only name people would recognize me by, and the only name which gives me my powers. Yet, it represents all I did wrong in my short life. That name, to me-- it is the same as Dracula to you.”
Vlad: “Then, do you want me to call you Mizukume instead?”
Tamamo: “No, no. Honestly, Mizukume brings up too many memories, and Caster feels too impersonal. Tamamo is my best bet. But you… you have a name you can be proud of. The name you already go by. Stick to it. Accept the powers your legend gives you, but if you never give up who you actually are, then you will never become that person. You will always remain Vlad the Third, Prince of Wallachia. Nothing more, and definitely nothing less. Do not even think you are like Carmilla, who has given herself up to her legend! You are more than that!”
Tamamo: “Never, ever, ever do you have to give your identity up! You never need to become anything you are not! You can use your Noble Phantasm, and you can be force-fitted into your legend, but not forever! Capisce?”
Nero: “Sniff-- what a speech!”
Tamamo: “You… you’ve put it well! Umu!”
Kintoki: “Buhuhuh! It’s so emotional! I can’t take it!”"
18,6071830,Tamamo,Kintoki,"Tamamo: Are you crying? You're both crying! Again, Kintoki! *Tamamo's ears twitch in irritation* It's so emotional! I can't take it!
Kintoki: Buhuhuh! It's so emotional!
Tamamo: You're saying that as if you're watching a drama on television... stop crying, the both of you!
Vlad: *puts on a grin* Because it's what he feels like doing.
Tamamo: What I said about Vlad and myself-- it applies to Shuten-doji too. She is not like Nobu, who accepted her monstrous reputation in life, or like Carmilla, who accepts it now. As long as she fights it, she will be the one you love.
Kintoki: Wait, but... if master ever summons her like Carmilla--
Tamamo: Shuten-doji will never be summoned like her. Elizabeth Bathory was always a brat, through and through. Anyone would be eons better than her.
Kintoki: Alright, alright, alright! You're the best, Tamamooo!
Tamamo: Wait, stop, don't hug me so tight-- urk--!
Okita: I must apologize for my behavior on our previous meeting. I had planned to discuss something important with Nobu, and I was already on edge. When she threw out that theory... I acted out on my instincts.
Tamamo: It's alright. I understand. By the graciousness of Tamamo-no-Mae, you have been forgiven! Now, if only that Demon Archer apologized too.
Okita: I invited her along, but she declined. She said she wanted to look up... more modern gun models. Things like... ayy-kay-fourty-seven? I think she's just trying to make excuses not to speak to me. Which is a pain, since we have much to discuss.
Tamamo: Hm... if she's trying to avoid you... I know! When Frankenstein leaped in on our last encounter, the shock almost knocked you down to your knees. Perhaps, upon seeing you in danger at the hands of someone who is not her, she felt a pang of distress? Something emotional, beyond her comprehension? A feeling that the Demon King would've never thought to feel?
Okita: Are you implying what I think you are?!
Tamamo: Oh, that's never stopped me before!
Okita: I don't want to know. Let's stop talking about this.
Tamamo: How disappointing... oh, but I do have an interesting story to tell. Something nice over tea. Have you ever heard of Shuten-doji?
Okita: One of the three great--
Tamamo: No, no! Throw that notion right out the window."
19,6071830,Okita,Tamamo,"Okita: I don't want to know. Let's stop talking about this, *deadpans*.

Tamamo: How disappointing... oh, but I do have an interesting story to tell. Something nice over tea, *suggests*. Have you ever heard of Shuten-doji?

Okita: *nods*. One of the three great--

Tamamo: No, no! Throw that notion right out the window! Here, I will tell you the true and exclusive version of the tale, never heard before! *raises her head grandly*. After all, who else is more credible than a youkai who lived around the same time herself? Tamamo will be the storyteller now. Forget everything you've heard before, and keep an open mind!

Tamamo: Once upon a time, *begins*. There was a beautiful young girl, daughter of Yamata-no-Orochi. She was born with fangs and incredible strength. From birth, she was an innocent monster."
