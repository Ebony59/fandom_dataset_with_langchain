0,6402778,Needa,Vader,"Needa: You know why he breathes like that, right? *overheard Lieutenant Jeffers whispering in the mess just last week* It’s to get you thinking about it. Breathing. So it’s all you can think about…until you can’t.
Vader: Captain Needa. *didn’t turn from the viewport*
Needa: Yes, Milord.
Vader: You have been careless, Captain. *still seemed more interested in the view than in Needa*
Needa: *thought* Oh gods, I’m going to die. I’m going to die, and Anwen’s turning five in a week and I’ll never see her again.
Vader: *turned only slightly away from the viewport* Do you know what this is, Captain?
Needa: *blinked* Is it…some kind of scrambler, Milord?
Vader: Very good. Had you been so astute before, you might have saved us both some trouble."
1,6402778,Vader,Needa,"Vader: At ease, Captain.
Needa: *body responds automatically to the command*
Vader: Several encoded transmissions were detected from your ship, Captain. Encoded in known Rebel frequencies. I received the report this morning.
Needa: *freezes, unable to think of anything to say*
Vader: You've put me in a very awkward position, Captain.
Needa: Milord?
Vader: I could have used you in your current posting. I had even thought you might do well as an admiral. But now it seems I'll have to kill you instead.
Needa: *gapes at Vader*
Vader: We are coming up on the Hoth system. I have ensured that Admiral Ozzel will bring the fleet out of hyperspace too close to the system, so that the Rebels will be alerted to our presence. You will hold your ship in the vanguard. You will attempt to capture the Rebels as they flee, and you will fail. And then you will report to me, to apologize.
Needa: *gapes at Vader, unable to comprehend*
Vader: Immediately before you report to me, you will take this. It will take effect within twenty minutes of consumption, and last for three hours. The effect will precisely mimic death. You will be dumped with the derelicts, and in three hours when you wake the fleet will be gone. You have the necessary transponder codes, I trust?
Needa: What? The transponder codes?
Vader: The transponder codes. To call a transport. Unless you wish to remain floating in space, of course.
Needa: I don't - you - what?
Vader: Perhaps I've been unclear. You have been compromised, Captain. You cannot continue."
2,6402778,Needa,Vader,"Needa: I don't – you – what?
Vader: Perhaps I've been unclear. You have been compromised, Captain. You cannot continue to serve in this position. I am offering you a way out.
Needa: *thoughts spun wildly* I don't understand, Milord.
Vader: *stares him down* The rain was long ago, but the desert does not forget.
Needa: *surprised* The desert never forgets.
Vader: The mighty one comes with the storm and with fire.
Needa: *whispers* We will walk free.
Vader: *nods* You have the transponder codes?
Needa: Yes. *reaches out to take the capsule*

Needa: *wakes up in a cargo hold* Darth Vader was a Rebel."
3,6402778,Darth Vader,Rebel,"Needa: Darth Vader was a Rebel. *his mind shied away from the thought*
Needa: It was ridiculous. It was impossible. *the Emperor's special agent, the ghost who moved in the shadows, who hunted the Rebellion relentlessly, who slaughtered his officers for the slightest failures.*
Needa: He was a Rebel. *it made a strange kind of sense, if he looked at it from an angle and forgot everything he knew about Darth Vader. Everything he thought he knew.*
Needa: Vader was known as an unstoppable, terrifying force, yet the same group of Rebels had repeatedly escaped him. *He'd been stationed on the Death Star when the plans were stolen, and his attempts to recover those plans must have been unsuccessful. The Rebels had destroyed the station. And Darth Vader had been the only survivor.*
Needa: We have someone on the inside. *his handlers had said. Someone on the inside...*

Needa: I hadn't been particularly patriotic, but I'd appreciated order, and I'd liked the routine of the work, the beauty of deep space, the sense of being a part of something more. *That was before Alderaan.*
Needa: Brenay was Alderaanian. *Her mother and father and three sisters had all lived there still. She'd had four nephews and two nieces, and to an only child like him, her extended family had seemed endless.*
Needa: And now they were all dead. *But Tarkin and his Death Star were dead too. And Darth Vader was a Rebel.*

Ahsoka: Sorry. *she didn't look it. Her grin was decidedly cheeky as she pulled back.* We heard you were dead, you know. I'm glad you're not.
Needa: So am I.
Ahsoka: If I ask how you got away, you won't be able to tell me, will you? *she asked at last.*
Needa: Classified. *he muttered, and was glad when she let it go at that.*
Ahsoka: I figured. *she said easily.* Well, Agent Classified, Mon Mothma wants to speak with you. I'd tell you why, but... *She shrugged and grinned.*
Needa: Lead on, then. *he told Ahsoka, and they set off at a brisk pace through the base.*

Mon Mothma: *The head of Alliance Intelligence was an elegant woman in her middle age, memorable mainly for the poise with which she carried herself, but...*"
4,6402778,Ahsoka,Mothma,"Ahsoka: Lead on, then.
Mothma: This is your stop.
Ahsoka: Come find me when you're done here? I'm sure you're hungry.
Mothma: Captain, it's good to see you alive.
Needa: I never expected to be.
Mothma: Your credentials are well-known.
Needa: I do?
Mothma: Ekkreth informs us that you are a sterling officer of unquestionable integrity.
Needa: Oh.
Mothma: You're still breathing.
Needa: Yes, and I still can't quite believe it.
Mothma: It's a lot to take in, isn't it?
Needa: *laughs*
Mothma: You understand, Captain Needa, that you cannot share this information with anyone.
Needa: I understand.
Mothma: Do you?
Needa: He didn't say -
Mothma: Let me be clear, Captain. You are now only the third person still living who is aware of Ekkreth's identity. Now do you understand?"
5,6402778,Needa,Mothma,"Needa: I - I understand, Ma'am, he stammered. I will hold this in the strictest confidence.
Needa: Thank you, Ma'am, he said again, and gave her a crisp salute. Mothma looked slightly bemused, but she returned the salute with a smile.
Needa: We had this same meatloaf two weeks ago, he told Ahsoka with a rueful smile. But that didn't stop him from taking another bite.
Ahsoka: Well, that makes sense, she said, grinning across the table at him. She'd already finished her own meal, and seemed to be thinking about going back for seconds. We intercepted an Imperial supply convoy not too long ago. Food enough for months.
Ahsoka: Sorry, she said at last. I'm just not used to Imperials who have a sense of humor. The moment the words left her mouth, she winced. Imperial defectors, that is.
Needa: We do have a tendency towards dark humor, he said now, with a rueful twist of his lip."
6,6402778,Needa,Ahsoka,"Needa: We do have a tendency towards dark humor. *with a rueful twist of his lip*
Ahsoka: *narrowed her eyes* I can tell you’re an old campaigner. You’ve got that thousand meter stare perfected.
Needa: Necessity, I’m afraid. Especially when you’re working under –  *froze*
Ahsoka: *watching him with sharp pity in her eyes* Vader. Yes. I know.
Needa: *thought* She didn’t know, No one did. No one but himself, Mon Mothma, and one other person.
Needa: *offered her a weak smile*"
7,6402778,Brenay,Needa,"Brenay: She’ll figure it out.
Needa: I really am. *bending to take two of the four packing cases Brenay had brought*
Brenay: You won’t ever have to go back. I’ve been so worried, Lorth… *her shoulder brushing his as they walked*
Needa: I know. *bumping his shoulder against hers in apology*
Anwen: Mama! Papa! Come on.
Needa: We’d better not keep her waiting. *breaking away from Brenay with a laugh*
Brenay: But you didn’t. *embracing him tightly*
Needa: Maybe you’re right. *biting his lip hard to hold back the strangled laugh that wanted to escape*
Needa: Maybe you’re right. *turning to kiss her*"
