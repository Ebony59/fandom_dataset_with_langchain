0,6458305,Dudley,Maybelle,"Dudley: “Dudley,” called Maybelle from the hall. “I’m leaving for Sarah’s now.”
Maybelle: “Did you hear me?”
Dudley: “Yeah, yeah,” Dudley glanced at her with a peevish grin. “Sarah’s. Tea.”
Maybelle: “Petunia’s sleeping now.”
Dudley: “Uh-huh.”
Maybelle: “If she wakes up, go get her. Don’t just leave her crying.”
Dudley: “I wouldn’t do that,” Dudley protested, keeping one eye on the television while he looked back at his wife.
Maybelle: “You did it last week.”
Dudley: “Which is why I’ll never do it again.”
Maybelle: *fighting back a smirk even as she tried to look severe*
Dudley: *grinned at her*
Maybelle: “And remember to actually watch her. You know how she likes the flowers.”
Dudley: “Yup,” said Dudley.
Maybelle: *gave a satisfied nod and left, 4-year-old Bobby Alan in tow.*
Dudley: *burrowed deeper into the couch and gave the television his full attention.*
Dudley: *froze and held his breath.*
Dudley: *focused his attention for another three minutes, and then Petunia coughed.*
Dudley: *let her stay there, babbling happily to herself.*
Dudley: *only half-listened as squeaking sounds emerged from the monitor, meaning that she had stood up and was bouncing in her crib.*
Dudley: *bolted up from the couch surprisingly quickly*
Dudley: *hurried upstairs*
Dudley: *pushed open the door to the nursery.*
Petunia: “Da-da!” Petunia chirruped cheerfully, holding out her hands over the edge of the crib.
Dudley: *entered the room, cautiously, looking for the cause of the crash.*
Dudley: “What’ve you got?” he asked, bewildered by the clump of lilacs in Petunia’s fist. They dripped water over her chubby fist. “Where’d you get those?”"
1,6458305,Dudley,Petunia,"Dudley: What’ve you got? *bewildered by the clump of lilacs in Petunia’s fist* Where’d you get those?
Petunia: Da-da, up! *impatiently, her fingers opening and closing in her free hand*
Dudley: Your mum won’t believe me that I didn’t let you knock this over. *grumbling, prying flowers from Petunia’s hands and making her scream* Come off it.
Maybelle: DUDLEY! *running towards him all in a panic, flushed and tearful* Dudley, I can’t find Petunia!
Dudley: Wha?
Maybelle: I can’t find Petunia!
Dudley: I FOUND HER! *roaring at last, staggering out, not even noticing the deep throbbing in the entire left side of his body* I FOUND HER!"
2,6458305,Dudley,Harry,"Dudley: Petunia set the curtains on fire.
Harry: Did you say this was Dudley?
Dudley: Yeah. Er - how are you?
Harry: All right.
Dudley: Does your sort ever set curtains on fire by sneezing?
Harry: Curtains - what? My sort? You mean wizards?
Dudley: Er, yeah.
Harry: I've never personally, uh, witnessed that. Why?"
3,6458305,Dudley,Harry,"Dudley: “Does your sort ever set curtains on fire by sneezing?”
Harry: “I’ve never personally, uh, witnessed that. Why?”
Dudley: “Could it happen? I mean, normal folk don’t ever set curtains on fire, do they?”
Harry: “You’re going to have to be a bit clearer than that, Duds.”
Dudley: “Petunia’s sneezing fire.”
Harry: “Aunt Petunia’s doing what?”
Dudley: “No, not mum! Petunia, my daughter!”
Harry: “Wait, are you saying Petunia’s—”
Petunia: *sneezes and sparks bounce down Dudley's sweater*
Dudley: “She’s done it again! Harry, what do I do?”
Harry: “I’m not – wow, I didn’t – look, mate, don’t panic, it’s nothing to be alarmed about –”
Dudley: “Nothing to be alarmed about?!”
Female voice: “Harry, who’s that?”
Harry: “Dudley.”
Female voice: “Dudley? Your cousin Dudley?”
Dudley: “What do I do??”
Harry: “Just keep an eye on her, okay? I don’t think it’ll hurt her. And then, uh, why don’t you bring her over for tea next weekend?”
Dudley: “How am I going to explain this to Maybelle?”
Harry: “Just tell her the truth, I s’pose.”
Dudley: *no response*

Dudley: “Don’t look, Flower.”
Harry: *muffled voice*
Female voice: “Dudley?”
Harry: “Your cousin Dudley?”
Dudley: “What do I do??”
Harry: “Just keep an eye on her, okay? I don’t think it’ll hurt her. And then, uh, why don’t you bring her over for tea next weekend?”
Dudley: “How am I going to explain this to Maybelle?”
Harry: “Just tell her the truth, I s’pose.”

Dudley: *no response*

Dudley: “Hello.”
Ginger-haired woman: “You must be Dudley. And this little firecracker must be Petunia.”
Dudley: “Hello.”
Harry: “Hey, Dudley.”"
4,6458305,Harry,Dudley,"Harry: Hey, Dudley.
Dudley: Hello.
Harry's wife: Well? Shall we go sit down?
Harry: Right, of course – er, Ginny, Dudley. Dudley, Ginny.
Harry: So, that’s James, and that’s Albus. And this is Petunia?
Dudley: *nods mutely*
Ginny: Nice bouquet.
Dudley: Lilies and carnations, yeah?
Ginny: Mum gave them to us. Early Christmas present.
Harry: Er, you, er, like flowers, Dudley?
Dudley: My wife, Maybelle, she, er – does bouquets a lot.
Harry: So, er, have you told her about…
Dudley: No.
Dudley: What exactly made you think she’s magical?
Dudley: *quietly explains about the flowers, the locked attic door, and the sneezing*
Harry: You knocked down a locked door?
Ginny: I didn’t know Muggles would try to do that without bombardo.
Dudley: Without – what?
Ginny: *elbowed by Harry*
Dudley: *continues talking about his football days and meeting his wife*
Dudley: *realizes the dinosaur models are actually in the shape of dragons*"
5,6458305,Dudley,Maybelle,"Dudley: What’s she talking about, Dudley?” Maybelle finally asked. Dudley shuffled his feet and admitted he’d taken her to see her cousins and they’d had some mechanical toys.
Maybelle: “You went to see your cousin?” said Maybelle looking bewildered. “Why, that’s – wonderful?” and she cast a suspicious glance at the Christmas card, barely visible through his office door. She’d asked about the Potters before and the only thing Dudley would tell her was that they were a bit…different.
Dudley: Er, remember my cousin?” he said cautiously.
Maybelle: “We have to take her to the hospital – oh, god –”
Dudley: “It’s normal,” said Dudley slowly.
Maybelle: “How can you say it’s normal?” Maybelle shrieked.
Dudley: “I mean, well, not normal, but do you remember my cousin?” Dudley tried again. “He’s a—er—he’s a—wizard.”
Maybelle: So what about your cousin?"
6,6458305,Maybelle,Harry,"Maybelle: So what do you do for a living?
Harry: I just got promoted to head Auror at the Ministry of Magic.
Maybelle: Head what?
Harry: Auror. Dark Wizard-catcher.
Maybelle: Oh.

Maybelle: Why didn’t you tell me earlier? It wouldn’t have been so perturbing!
Dudley: Didn’t know how.

Maybelle: Dud—ley—you—great—id-i-ot!

Maybelle: Haaarrryy!
Harry: What is it now, Dudley?
Dudley: *unintelligible*
Harry: Slow down, Dudley.
Dudley: I’ll read it."
7,6458305,Harry,Dudley,"Harry: I’ll read it, said Dudley, and there was the rustling of papers. Dudley read slowly, pausing before carefully pronouncing the long words – he correctly pronounced most of them. Harry resisted the sincere urge to compliment him, aware it would sound like an insult. Dear Mr. and Mrs. Dursley – we are aware of several instances of magic—occurring on a regular basis at your—residence. While these instances are un-der-stand-a-ble for inexperienced wizards and witches, as your daughter is now of a – reasonable age to resist practicing magic, we must warn you that this—frequency is generally not tolerated. Continued instances may –require further –investigation, which may –jeopardize your daughter’s—eligibility to attend Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. If you feel your daughter has extra difficulty, do not—hesitate to contact the ministry to request an—exemption.
Dudley: What do I do? said Dudley, back to the wailing tone of voice. She can’t get expelled before she goes! She’ll be so miserable!
Harry: Huh, said Harry thoughtfully.
Dudley: What good is that if she can’t go to school?
Harry: Oh. Well, have you talked to her about it?
Dudley: Yes, said Dudley miserably. She just laughed. She thinks it’s a big joke. Me and Maybelle can’t get to her.
Harry: Hm, said Harry thoughtfully. Are you still coming for Christmas dinner?
Dudley: Yeah, I guess, said Dudley.
Harry: I have an idea.

*Harry: Oh, I wonder what that could be, said Harry theatrically. Sending an owl at Christmas? Must be serious! Harry sauntered over to the window, opened it, and took the envelope. The owl fluttered away. He turned around, eyes wide behind his glasses. Petunia, it’s for you! And it’s – a Howler! One could almost hear the orchestral doom sound-effects in the background. Ginny rested one elbow on the table and pinched the bridge of her nose, but Petunia stared with wide eyes as she took it from Harry.
Petunia: What – what’s a Howler? she asked nervously.
Harry: Open it, quickly, said Harry, as the envelope began to smoke.
Howler: PETUNIA DURSLEY!!! WE REG..."
8,6458305,Petunia,Harry,"Petunia: What – what’s a Howler?
Harry: Open it, quickly.
...
Howler: PETUNIA DURSLEY!!! WE REGRET TO INFORM YOU THAT YOU HAVE BEEN PRE-EXPELLED FROM HOGWARTS SCHOOL OF WITCHCRAFT AND WIZARDRY!! YOUR BEHAVIOR HAS BEEN REPREHENSIBLE! WE HAVE ON GOOD AUTHORITY THAT YOU HAVE BEEN DISOBEYING YOUR PARENTS AND IRRESPONSIBLY PERFORMING MAGIC LEFT AND RIGHT WITH NO REGARDS TO THE CONSEQUENCES! YOU ARE A SHAME TO THE WHOLE WIZARDING WORLD!! IF YOU DO NOT REFORM IMMEDIATELY WE WILL HAVE NO CHOICE BUT TO ARREST YOU. SINCERELY, MINISTER OF MAGIC KINSLEY SHACKLEBOLT.
...
Petunia: Daddy, they can’t! They can’t!
Dudley: They just did, Flower. I’m sorry.
Petunia: What if I write and tell them I’m sorry? I promise to be good, I’ll never do magic on purpose again—
Maybelle: That’s what happens when you don’t listen to your mum and dad.
Dudley: Maybe Harry knows someone—
Petunia: Cousin Harry! You know the minister of magic, don’t you? You’re friends? Please tell him I didn’t mean it, I’ll do anything—
Harry: Hmmm... Do you promise to obey your mum and dad from now on?
Petunia: Yes! Yes!
Harry: All right, I’ll write Shacklebolt and get you un-expelled. He owes me a favor.
...
Dudley: Here, Flower, you can have my pudding, there’s no ash on it.
...
James: Look, look! Can I ride it? Please?
Harry: Not in the house!
Ginny: Oh, let him. It’s Christmas, and I don’t want to go out to an abandoned field so they can fly."
9,6458305,James,Harry,"James: Can I ride it? Please?
Harry: Nope.
James: *mounting the broom and zooming around the large living room*
Harry: Not in the house!
Ginny: Oh, let him. It's Christmas, and I don't want to go out to an abandoned field so they can fly.
James: *laughing hysterically*
Children: Plleeeaaaassse!
James: No!
Harry: James.
James: *face fell* Oh, all right, fine.
Petunia: Daddy, let me ride it, pleeeaaase?
Maybelle: I don't think that's a good idea –
Dudley: *looking into Petunia's wide, pleading eyes* Oh, let her. It's Christmas.
Maybelle: All right.
Petunia: Yes! Help me on, Daddy. Help me on.
Dudley: *awkwardly holding the broom for her while she got on*
Harry: *coming over to help* Put your hands there, don't hold it crooked, kick your feet up—there, you've got it!
Petunia: *wobbling into the air, laughing nervously*
Dudley: *standing back*
Petunia: Daddy, look at me! Mummy, look!
Maybelle: We're looking.
James: Come down. I'll give you a fast ride.
Petunia: *landing and James climbing on behind her*
James: Watch this!
Ginny: James! No tricks—
James: *trying to do some sort of loop in the air, hitting the mantle, and crashing into Dudley's stomach*
Harry: JAMES!
Maybelle: PETUNIA!
Dudley: *sitting up* Oof.
James: Oh gosh, I'm really, really, really, really sorry, Cousin Dudley—
Dudley: It's okay. I have lots of padding.
Bobby Alan: Can I ride it?
Harry: Er.
Maybelle: The thing is, Bobby, only magical people can ride brooms. It doesn't work for the rest of us.
Bobby Alan: That's not fair! Why does she get to do everything? Why's she get to be special? How come I gotta go to a stupid Muggle school, and she'll get to go to a magic one?
Dudley: Your mum and me are –er—Muggles.
Bobby Alan: *scrubbing his eyes*"
10,6458305,Dudley,Bobby Alan,"Dudley: How come I gotta go to a stupid Muggle school, and she’ll get to go to a magic one? I HATE being a Muggle!
Bobby Alan: *His fists scrubbed at his eyes.*
Dudley: Maybe one of your cousins could take you for a ride on a broom. You know, a big one.
Harry: Yeah, that’s an idea! What do you say, Bobby?
Bobby Alan: I want a ride on a big broom!
Petunia: No.
Dudley: You’re too young.
Maybelle: I don’t know if this is a good idea—
Bobby Alan: Mum!
Ginny: I could take him, if that makes you more comfortable. I was a professional Quidditch player.
Dudley: Quidditch?
Bobby Alan: Wizarding football, Dad.
Maybelle: All right. If Ginny takes him.
Dudley: Because your mum and me aren’t magical. Stop whining.
Dudley: Harry, where’s this – diagonally, eh?
Harry: Diagon Alley?
Dudley: Yeah, whatever. Ruddy thing doesn’t show up on any Google searches—
Harry: No, Dudley, it wouldn’t. You can’t expect us to have shops selling magical stuff out in the open.
Dudley: Why not? Make it a lot easier to find—
Harry: Does this mean Petunia got her letter?
Dudley: Yeah. Came yesterday.
Harry: That’s great!
Dudley: Yeah. She’s all excited, but Bobby’s mad again, think I’ll buy him a present at diagonally.
Harry: Diagon Alley.
Dudley: So where’s it at? Do we gotta stand in a circle and say magic words and throw salt over our shoulders or what?
Harry: No. Tell you what, are you free on Saturday? You could go over with us.
Dudley: Yeah, OK.
Harry: Can you be over here by nine?
Dudley: Bloody hell, Harry, I don’t get up until ten on Saturdays.
Harry: Fine. Eleven, then?
Dudley: Yeah, OK.
Dudley: We gotta do what?
Harry: We gotta use the Floo Network. It's a way of traveling by fireplace.
Dudley: Couldn’t—couldn’t we just go in the car?"
11,6458305,Ginny,Harry,"Ginny: We gotta do what?
Harry: Couldn’t—couldn’t we just go in the car?
Ginny: If you want to, Dudley.
Harry: I want to go in the fireplace!
Bobby Alan: You’re so boring, Dad.
Dudley: OK, what do we do?
Harry: Oh, and Dudley, make sure you pronounce it Diagon Alley. If you don’t you might end up on Knockturn Alley.
Dudley: I think I can pronounce the ruddy word.
Dudley: Diagon Alley!
Ginny: Good, you’ve all made it through first try.
Ginny: Harry, I’m going to get started book-shopping. You go with Dudley.
Dudley: I think we can manage school supply-shopping.
Harry: You’ll want Ollivander’s.
Dudley: So where’s this Oldevandy’s?
Harry: Ollivander’s. This way, follow me.
Harry: Here we go.
Ollivander: Hello, Mr. Potter!
Harry: No, he’ll be coming in later. This is my cousin, Dudley Dursley, and his wife Maybelle. They need a wand for their daughter, Petunia.
Ollivander: Muggles, are you?
Dudley: Yes.
Ollivander: Very good, always in need of fresh blood. All right, step right up, Little Lady."
12,6458305,Dudley,Ollivander,"Dudley: Yes, *puffed out his chest*, silently daring Ollivander to make a disparaging comment. Ollivander just smiled.
Ollivander: Very good, always in need of fresh blood, *said cheerfully*. All right, step right up, Little Lady.
Dudley: *shrank back several steps*, as did Maybelle, as they stared in awe and a little in fear at their daughter, who was making several small explosions as multiple wands were rejected.
Bobby Alan: *smirked* every time this happened, and Petunia looked more and more miffed. But at last, she took a wand of Rowan wood with a Unicorn Hair core (Dudley wasn’t sure he’d heard correctly), and then he took another step back as a golden wind swirled around his daughter, whipping her mousy hair about her face. Bobby Alan looked awed, and Dudley was dimly aware that this might mean Petunia would rub it in her brother's face. But she merely studied her wand with a thoughtful look on her face.
Dudley: *stepped forward*, getting out his wallet.
Harry: *smacked his forehead*. “Merlin’s beard, Dudley, I completely forgot you need money!”
Dudley: I have money! *protested*, extremely offended. He addressed Ollivander, “Do you take VISA?”
Ollivander: *looked at him blankly*. “I beg your pardon?”
Harry: *looking embarrassed*. “Sorry, you need Wizarding money.”
Dudley: I need what?
Harry: *repeated*. “Wizarding money. We have to exchange it at the Wizarding bank.”
Dudley: *blurted*. “Your sort have different money? What, are you British citizens or aren’t you?”
Harry: “We are,” *said Harry*. “But the Wizarding world uses their own money, that’s all. Here,” *Harry pulled a drawstring bag out of his pocket*. “I’ll pay for this, then we’ll get your money exchanged at Gringotts and you can pay me back.”
Ollivander: *looked amused*. Maybelle looked embarrassed. Dudley was furious, both with himself and with Harry, but Petunia thought it was funny. “Your face is red, Daddy.”
Dudley: *purchased robes, a cauldron, and an owl next*. Dudley didn’t like the idea of buying an owl at first (he felt he must have been permanently traumatized by them because Vernon had ranted constantly about how terrible owls were ever since that fateful 11th birthday of Harry’s), but when Harry explained that there really was no way at all to communicate with Petunia unless they used a wizard’s owl, and it would be much more convenient if Petunia had her own owl, Dudley relented and purchased a small one. It was plain and brown, but Petunia was delighted. “It’s so cute, Daddy!”
Bobby Alan: *became more and more subdued*, and he looked near the breaking point when he longingly read the titles on Petunia’s new schoolbooks as they rummaged through the bookshelves.
Dudley: Maybelle, *said Dudley*. “I’m going to take Bobby and get some ice cream.”
Maybelle: “Good idea,” *she said*, looking a little frightened at the prospect of him leaving her. “But, hurry back, won’t you?”
Dudley: “Come on, Bobby,” *said Dudley*, taking his son and disappearing through the doors.
Ginny: Hey, *said Ginny*, joining them half an hour later in Slug and Jiggers Apothecary. She looked all around. “Where’s Dudley and Bobby?”
Harry: *had somehow not realized until that moment that they’d vanished*, he’d been having such a fun time with firecracker Petunia.
Maybelle: “They went to get ice cream,” *said Maybelle*. “Bobby was feeling left out.”
Harry: *felt a little guilty*. “Right. This is our last stop, Ginny, what about you?”
Ginny: “Ours too,” *said Ginny*.
Harry: “All right. Let’s go find them.”"
13,6458305,Ginny,Harry,"Ginny: Harry, you don't think they'd be at Weasleys', do you? That's a good place for any kid, magical or not.
Harry: I have a bad feeling about this.
George: Hiya, Harry! Hi Sis! Shopping for Albus?
Harry: Yeah.
George: Isn't it great? I love it when Muggles come in here, their reactions are twice as good.
Harry: That's my cousin, Dudley.
George: Dudley! The Dudley? The ton-tongue toffee Dudley? Blimey, I thought he looked familiar!
Harry: Blimey, you don't mean to—has he got—
Harry: This is his daughter—
George: Blimey, a Muggle-born Dursley. It's a miracle.
Harry: Dudley's not so bad.
Ginny: What in Merlin's name was—
Harry: Sorry about all the pranks. Here's something to make up for it.
Ginny: Oh, honestly!
Dudley: I got you, didn't I? Got you, eh? The candy was from the joke shop too!"
14,6458305,Dudley,Harry,"Dudley: I got you, didn't I? *gleefully* Got you, eh? The candy was from the joke shop too!
Harry: Oh, yeah. *dryly* I was sick for days. Good one, Duds.
Maybelle: You want me to come with you?
Dudley: No. *Better if I do it myself.*
Petunia: Diddy! It's so good to see you, come in, come in.
Vernon: Dudley! Good to see you looking so sporting, old Maybelle's feeding you well, isn't she?
Dudley: Yeah. *with a nervous grin* All good.
Petunia: So where is Petunia going this fall? You've been rather vague.
Dudley: Er, well, the thing is...
Petunia: You are sending her somewhere, aren't you?
Dudley: Well, yeah. *shifted* Um, I've been visiting Harry a bit... *Vernon and Petunia both flinched* And well, er, we've decided that Petunia will go to school with Albus.
Vernon: Who's Albus?
Dudley: Harry's son.
Petunia: Did you say... his son?
Vernon: Where's his son going, boy?
Dudley: Harry's school.
Petunia: You don't mean to say—
Dudley: Petunia's a witch.
Vernon: Don't—say—that—word! *roared* Don't mention those—you can't let her, boy, you can't let her grow up to be like those – those – freaks of nature!"
15,6458305,Harry,Dudley,"Dudley: Harry's not a freak.
Vernon: Don't say that word!
Dudley: They saved our lives. It wasn't Harry's fault. Wasn't the other wizards' fault either.
Petunia: Dudley, please don't - just talk to Petunia, send her to a nice school.
Dudley: Harry's all right. We were awful.
Petunia: Petunia's very sweet - I know the oddities will melt out of her if we just leave it alone.
Vernon: Freakishness will just melt away.
Dudley: Petunia's going to Hogwarts, and if you don't like it, you can stuff it. And don't call Harry or Petunia freaks. If you do I'll never speak to you again.
Dudley: No!
Bobby Alan: Why not?
Dudley: Don't have television for one thing. Don't use computers, can't even send email. Er - have to rely on owls to talk to anybody. Bloody impractical.
Dudley: If I was your mum I could read French and German, but I can't. Don't really care. I like where I am."
16,6458305,Dudley,Bobby Alan,"Dudley: Er – have to rely on owls to talk to anybody. Bloody impractical.
Bobby Alan: But you could do magic.
Dudley: If I was your mum I could read French and German, but I can’t. Don’t really care. I like where I am.
Bobby Alan: *quiet for several minutes* I’m going to join the robotics club at school.
Dudley: Robots, eh? Good for you.
Bobby Alan: They have a championship every year. They give out lots of awards.
Dudley: Championships, so they play football or something?
Bobby Alan: No, Dad. They have to do certain things, like throw balls or go up ramps and do pull ups or something.
Dudley: Throw balls? Sounds like football to me.
Bobby Alan: DAD.
Dudley: *A week later an owl crashed into their sliding glass back door in the evening, making Maybelle and Dudley jump. Bobby Alan had left for school now too. Dudley, pretending like he knew what he was doing, went over the door and let the owl (it was Cupcake) in. It settled onto his shoulder and hooted, promptly dropping the letter. Dudley pushed it off his shoulder, making it flap and hoot angrily, then retreat to balance on the back of the couch. Dudley bent down and retrieved the letter.* It’s from Petunia, he said, even though that was obvious. Her letter had obviously been written very quickly, the handwriting scrawling sloppily across the page, the sentences running together and surrounded by very large ink blots.
Maybelle: Flying lessons? They aren’t teaching eleven-year-olds to fly around on broomsticks, are they?
Dudley: I dunno. Sounds like it. It’ll be fine, he said at the horrified look on Maybelle’s face. Brooms are their cars, it’s just driver’s ed, I’m sure it’s not dangerous.
Maybelle: *lost tone of voice* Sorted?
Dudley: The hell is a Hufflepuff?
Maybelle: *bewildered* What now?
Dudley: What now?"
17,6458305,Maybelle,Dudley,"Maybelle: I think we need to write her name and address.
Dudley: What’s the Hogwarts address?
Maybelle: I don’t know. How’s that?
Dudley: I guess it knows the way to Hogwarts, anyway. Like carrier pigeons.

Petunia: I dunno why we gotta write essays. S’long’s we can do the magic.
Bobby Alan: *difficulty getting a word in edgewise*
Petunia: S’long, Nerd.
Bobby Alan: S’long, Tuna.
Maybelle: The Destroyer?
Bobby Alan: That’s what she keeps calling our robotics project.

Maybelle: That only makes sense because he has Harry who was the youngest Seeker in a century as a dad and a professional Quidditch player for a mum.
Dudley: I was certain Muggle football genes would count for something in Wizarding football too.
Maybelle: *sent a worried letter to Harry and Ginny*
Harry: he would ask James to at least make sure there were very experienced Quidditch flyers around.
Ginny: *sent another letter about five minutes later correcting Harry’s letter*

Maybelle: She’s getting passive-aggressive, isn’t she?"
18,6458305,Maybelle,Dudley,"Maybelle: She’s getting passive-aggressive, isn’t she?
Dudley: But what if she’s the only student around without a broomstick?
Maybelle: Don’t be ridiculous, Dudley, there are lots of other Muggle-born students there and I’m positive their parents are just as sensible and don’t allow their children to go whizzing about on little sticks of wood either.
Dudley: She might get made fun of.
Maybelle: I’m certain the teachers would put a stop to that sort of nonsense, if she didn’t herself. Besides, broomsticks can be horrendously expensive.
Dudley: What if we gave her one for next Christmas? It’d be too late to use it, so she still wouldn’t try out for Quidditch until she was fourteen.
Maybelle: Absolutely not!

Dudley: C’mon, give the kid a broomstick. If I get one more letter filled with nothing but magical gobbledygook and wind resistance and anti-slipping charms I’m going to lose my mind. Besides, broomsticks are basically the magical equivalent of a bicycle. What kind of parents wouldn’t give their poor kid a bicycle?

Dudley: *left work early one day to sneak to Diagon Alley and buy a broomstick. He made sure that was not returnable before going home with it.*
Petunia: *Christmas morning of Petunia’s third year, Bobby Alan affixed a note to the ribbon on a very long, obviously-shaped package.*
Petunia: Thanks, Nerd.

Petunia: Worst day ever. Didn’t make the team. Hexed some Ravenclaw kid named Lorcan because he tricked Danni into giving him her Honeydukes candy. Got in trouble of course because it happened in the middle of Herbology, and the rules are stupid, he deserved it, and now I’ve got detention with Longbottom and he'll probably make me write like 500 lines.
Dudley: Don’t worry, Flower, I’m sure with some more practice you can make the team next year.

Dudley: *The Easter holidays of Petunia’s fifth year were a massive stresser on everybody, because Grandma Petunia and Granddad Vernon were coming to dinner. Dudley went about the house, taking down moving photographs and moving miniature Quidditch player models to bedrooms and storage closets.*
Petunia: I should have just stayed at Hogwarts to study, griped Petunia, slamming down plates on the kitchen table as she set it for dinner. Grandma and Granddad were due to arrive any minute. The OWLs are killing me – stupid writing."
19,6458305,Petunia,Dudley,"Petunia: I should have just stayed at Hogwarts to study. The OWLs are killing me – stupid writing sections, honestly, the practical exams are much more sensible – who cares about theory, so long as you can actually do it— And we have to use these stupid quills—it didn’t matter so much the first few years, but my hands ache all the time now! I tried to bring nice ballpoint pens, and Flitwick told me straight away I couldn’t use them because they couldn’t put anti-cheating spells on them—as if I would cheat, I’m in Hufflepuff what do they expect? *threw silverware across the tablecloth*
Dudley: Flower, remember not to talk about OWLs at dinner.
Petunia: Oh, sure, Dad! I’ll just keep my mouth shut, shall I? *grumbled and flinging water glasses across the table*
Maybelle: Could you refill the biscuit platter for me, please?
Petunia: Sure, Mum, *snapped and flounced out of the room*
Maybelle: Petunia!
Dudley: So that football game last Friday...
Maybelle: Petunia!
Vernon: We're leaving. *choked out*"
20,6458305,Dudley,Petunia,"Dudley: You're not allowed—
Petunia: Biscuit, Granddad?
Petunia: Biscuit, Grandma?
Vernon: We're leaving. Boy—expected better than this from you—inviting us here—just to shove our faces in—
Dudley: Look, it's not—
Vernon: We're leaving. Petunia, come on!
Dudley: What did you do that for?
Petunia: Do what?
Petunia: Do what I've been learning for the past five years? Do what I was trained to do at the school you sent me to?
Petunia: YOU KNOW IT UPSETS THEM. YOU DID IT ON PURPOSE.
Petunia: THEY HATE ME ANYWAY! I DON'T CARE WHAT THEY THINK!
Dudley: They don't hate you! That's a terrible thing to say! They've been sending you presents every year, haven't they?
Petunia: Come off it, Dad. I've known since I was thirteen that their presents are from you.
Dudley: Even so, they're my parents. I asked you specifically not to upset them—you did it anyway—very disrespectful—and now you're going to get in trouble for doing magic outside of school—
Petunia: Disrespectful? Go to your room! We'll be getting an owl any moment—you've been completely disobedient—complete disgrace—go to your room!
Bobby Alan: That was really unfair of you, Dad.
Dudley: Me, unfair!
Bobby Alan: Yeah.
Bobby Alan: What if Grandma and Granddad didn't like computers? What if they had horrible prejudices against computer programmers? Would you hide all of my school awards? Would you move all the pictures of me with my friends to moldy, dusty storage cupboards? Would you make me sit silently and let Grandma and Granddad treat me like I'm some sort of scum on the bottom of an old boot that they can't bear to look at or acknowledge?
Dudley: That wasn't—I'm not—that's different!
Bobby Alan: How? How is it different?
Dudley: Well—it's—
Bobby Alan: I'm going to bed."
21,6458305,Dudley,Bobby Alan,"Dudley: “That wasn’t—I’m not—that’s different!”
Bobby Alan: “How?” Bobby Alan demanded. “How is it different?”
Dudley: “Well—it’s—”
Bobby Alan: *got up without waiting for an answer* “I’m going to bed,” he said bitterly, and he too went upstairs.
Dudley: *looked helplessly at Maybelle*
Maybelle: “He’s not right, is he?”
Dudley: *looked at Maybelle*
Maybelle: “I know they’re your parents, but…” *trailed off*
Dudley: *got to his feet and heavily climbed the stairs*
Dudley: *knocked on the door*
Petunia: *opened the door* “Daddy, I’m s-s-sorry—hic—I didn’t—hic—I just got so mad—hic—I have a t-t-terrible t-temper and I’ve r-r-ruined it—hic—I know you’ve been p-planning this for—hic—w-w-w-w-weeks—”
Dudley: “Not your fault, Flower,” he said, vision blurring. “Not your fault, it’s mine. And theirs. I’m getting all your pictures back out. They’ll never come here again.”
Dudley: “Owl for you, Flower,” Dudley called, because it almost always was for her.
Petunia: *clambered down the stairs*
Petunia: *took the letter* “Dad, Al says we’re invited to a family Christmas party.”
Dudley: “OK,” said Dudley, unconcerned.
Bobby Alan: “Big deal, Tuna,” said Bobby Alan. “We visit the Potters all the time.”
Petunia: “Don’t call me Tuna!”  said Petunia in a surprisingly cheerful tone of voice. “You don’t understand, it’s not the Potters—well, it is, but they want us to come visit everybody—their whole family! The—” she looked back at the letter. “—the Weasleys, Tonks’, Delacours—it’s not at the Potters’, it’s at the Burrow—Dad, it’s all our Wizarding relatives at once!” Petunia looked ecstatic.
Dudley: “Er,” said Dudley with an unpleasant twisting sensation in his stomach.
Bobby Alan: “Woah,” said Bobby Alan, looking up with wide eyes, pausing in his typing. “That’s some party.”"
22,6458305,Petunia,Dudley,"Petunia: �s not at the Potters’, it’s at the Burrow—Dad, it’s all our Wizarding relatives at once!” *looked ecstatic*.
Dudley: Er, *unpleasant twisting sensation in his stomach*.
Bobby Alan: Woah, *looking up with wide eyes, pausing in his typing*. That’s some party.
Petunia: Can we go, Daddy? Pleeeaase? *bounced on her toes*.
Dudley: Sure you can.
Petunia: No, Daddy, *got down on her knees next to his chair and leaned her head on his arm, looking up into his face*. You have to come too! Please?
Dudley: Er, *I’ll have to ask your mum*.
Petunia: And you too, Bobby! *looking over at her brother*.
Bobby Alan: Gosh, Tuna, I’d feel so weird surrounded by wizards when I can’t do a thing. *Dudley silently cheered him on*.
Petunia: Don’t be stupid! *huffed*. How do you think I feel, spending my whole summer surrounded my Muggles? Other than you all, of course, *she added quickly*.
Bobby Alan: I’m going to regret this, but okay, I'll go…IF you force James and Al to not prank me by charming my shoes to dance when I put them on. *He looked up with a rather watery expression*. They’re not going to give me enough peace to work on my code, are they?
Petunia: It’ll do you good being separated from your tech, Nerd. And you’re very good at jiving.
Bobby Alan: They can’t sneak up on me under the Invisibility Cloak either.
Petunia: Aw, come on—
Bobby Alan: And absolutely no Nosebleed Nougats mixed into my yogurt at breakfast.
Petunia: Just kill the fun before it starts, why don’t you?
Bobby Alan: Promise or I’m not coming.
Petunia: All right, all right, I promise!"
23,6458305,Bobby Alan,Molly Weasley,"Bobby Alan: Look at that, *muttered under his breath*, You'd think they genuinely all like each other.
Molly Weasley: Oh, hello dears. *Turned towards the little Dursley huddle*, You must be Harry's cousins. *Smiled, but her eyes were very sharp and inquiring as she looked them all, especially Dudley, up and down.*
Dudley: Hi.
Molly Weasley: I'm Molly Weasley, lovely to meet you, come sit down, have a cup of tea?
Ginny: Good trip, I trust, Fleur?
Fleur: Parlez-vous français?
Maybelle: Oui, je parle français.
Arthur Weasley: Bless me, are you Harry's cousin? *practically ran up to Dudley, struggling and squeezing his way through the crush of people*, Arthur Weasley, delighted you're here, been dying to meet you—tell me, what do you do for a living?
Dudley: I'm a salesman.
Arthur Weasley: Fascinating! *looked enthralled*, And you must be Bobby Alan, *said to Bobby Alan*, Petunia's older brother? Heard a lot about you.
Bobby Alan: Have you?
Arthur Weasley: Yes indeed, don't you go to a Muggle university? What is it like? What do you study?
Bobby Alan: I'm a computer programmer—
Arthur Weasley: Programmer? Of computers? No, wait, don't tell me…it's like charms, then, for the computers, which work on electricity, right?
Bobby Alan: Kind of."
24,6458305,Arthur,Bobby Alan,"Arthur: This is Bobby Alan, he does Muggle charms on computation machines. And this is Dudley, he plays Muggle Quidditch.
Bobby Alan: And that’s my kid sister Tuna. She drives us up the wall.
Petunia: DON’T CALL ME TUNA!
Dudley: What’s this about your dark-wizard catching, eh?
George: Regale us with tales of your heroics.
Teen: Tell the one where Uncle Ron set your hair on fire!
George: There’s no possible way you want to hear that one again. Not like you haven’t heard it thirty times before.
Ron: Why doesn’t anyone ever remember it blasted that poison-taloned harpy off of his head?
Harry: Almost took my head off with it.
Bobby Alan: *let out a blood-curdling screech and fell over backwards out of his chair.*
Dudley: *jumped up out of instinct*
Bobby Alan: YOU’RE GOING TO PAY FOR THAT!
Petunia: You didn’t ban fireworks in your food! You said no nosebleed nougats!
George: Edible Explosives.
Dudley: Don’t worry about Bobby Alan. He gets much worse at home. He’ll be planning his revenge already.
Petunia: Dad, we’re going to play football! We’ve decided to show them a thing or two about Muggle sports. Come play on my team, okay?
James: Hang on, I didn’t agree to football! You asked if I wanted to play Muggle Quidditch, I said Quidditch sounded great—
Petunia: What’s the matter? Afraid we’ll kick your butts?
James: No."
25,6458305,James,Petunia,"James: Hang on, I didn’t agree to football! *ran up after her, panting* You asked if I wanted to play Muggle Quidditch, I said Quidditch sounded great—
Petunia: What’s the matter? *taunted* Afraid we’ll kick your butts?
James: No.
Dudley: *got up out of his chair*
Petunia: *cheered*
Teddy Lupin: *conjured a referee’s whistle for her*
Petunia: *blew the whistle many times during the game whenever the Quidditch-trained players made an egregious error*
James: *believed that Dudley, Petunia, Bobby Alan, Teddy Lupin, and Fred did indeed kick their butts*
Bobby Alan: *discretely fist-bumped Teddy Lupin*
Dudley: BOBBY ALAN WHAT HAVE YOU DONE WITH OUR WANDS.
Dudley: *saw Bobby Alan discretely fist-bump Teddy Lupin*
Albus Potter: *strutted up to Maybelle and Dudley, plopping two large, soft, lumpy packages into their laps* These are for you, *he said* From all the Potters. Petunia picked the colors for us. It was Lily’s idea, but she’s too shy to give them to you herself.
Maybelle: *blushed and hid her face in her hands*
Dudley: *realized that all of the Potters were watching them from various places in the room*
Dudley: *opened his package* Go on, put them on! *James urged, coming from across the room*
Dudley: *glanced at Maybelle*
Maybelle: *obediently stood up and put the robes over their shoulders*
Potter children: *burst into applause*
James: Congratulations, you are Honorary Wizards, *he said pompously*
Maybelle: Thank you, *she said* I love it.
Bobby Alan: *growled from where he leaned against the wall, arms crossed* Oh, very nice.
Petunia: *sweetly* You have one too, Nerd. Unfortunately, we’ve quite forgotten where we’ve put it, and we won’t remember until you’ve given us our wands back.
Dudley: *felt his face growing hot and his nose began prickling and he found himself quite unable to say a single word*"
