0,6468994,Harry,Hermione,"Harry: Should we have expected this? *looks at Hermione*
Hermione: Ron's...well... *shrugs, for once at a loss for words*
Harry: Let's face it, Ron's never been exactly unflinching in his support. Not the way you've been. What has he ever had to do that's been really hard? Besides facing giant spiders. He crumbles at the first sign of a problem. Even during Quidditch if you think about it.
Hermione: He never has understood why it was important that I go home each summer. And he just...assumes we agree with him about so many things."
1,6468994,Harry,Hermione,"Harry: He never has understood why it was important that I go home each summer. And he just...assumes we agree with him about so many things.
Hermione: And he got mad and left us over food.
Harry: I've been half starved every year until I was eleven and then it was every summer. There's a reason I'm so bloody short.
Hermione: We ought to see about getting you some nutrient potions.
Harry: She does. But for some reason every time she mentioned it something else happened, usually Dumbledore related.
Harry: Meantime, let's do what we couldn't possibly have with Ron around and go Muggle for a while. If we don't use magic no one will notice us.
Hermione: Thats...actually a good idea.
Harry: How about London? After we get food from the grocers, we could call Kreacher and ask him to do the elf version of apparition right into Grimmauld. That way we wouldn't be seen by any watchers. There's got to be something in the library about the wards. I'm the owner of the house, I should be able to apparate directly into the entryway after all. We didn't need to appear on the stoop.
Hermione: All right. How about the alley next to that little cafe we nearly destroyed?
Harry: I can do that. *Harry nodded and wrapped his arm around her waist.* Hold on."
2,6468994,Hermione,Harry,"Hermione: Harry's right. You're so experienced Kreacher, you should be more of the majordomo or a butler type of elf. If we could find you a couple of elves to help, would you be willing to train them? That way you'd have some help but you could teach them.
Harry: Yeah, to be proper elves to the Potters and the Blacks. After all Kreacher, we want you to take care of us for a long time. You're a wonderful elf. And if you taught other elves how to take care of us, I'd feel a lot better about having a family. I've never had a proper one you know. I'd really be depending on you to help me.
Kreacher: Master is not trying to replace Kreacher with a younger, new-fangled elf?
Harry: God no! You're a Black elf Kreacher. It would be wrong to have any other elf in charge of the house. Hermione and I just thought that some help with the place, elves that you could train, would be a good idea. It's a big house...
Hermione: There are rooms we haven't even seen yet because they're closed off. Wouldn't you like to see the house all opened up and used again?
Kreacher: Kreacher will teach any elf Master Harry and Missy finds. Teach them to be proper Black elves. Master Harry and Missy will have to ask the Potter elves about training anymore to be Potter elves.
Harry: Potter elves? I didn't know there were any Potter elves.
Kreacher: At the Pottery Manse. Pottery Manse is where the Potter elves be. Pottery Manse has shut tight since the Potters died. Our poor Mistress Dorea. We miss her.
Harry: Kreacher, could...could you go and get the head Potter elf? We've never been to Pottery Manse. And I know a few people who could use a place to hide.
Kreacher: We will call for the head Potter elf. But Master should be certain to tell the Potter elves that Master is also a Black and our master. We will not have Potter elves here.
Harry: I'll do that Kreacher. Thank you."
3,6468994,Hermione,Harry,"Hermione: Harry, we need you to tell the locket to open. No one else speaks parseltongue and you still do.
Harry: *nodded and extended his hand, clasping hers gratefully as she helped him sit up* Open. *commanded and watched as smoke and black mist poured out of the locket*
Ironheart: *nodded again, placing gems around the crystal, activating a ward scheme* Do you think...
Hermione: If we had Ron with us would we have thought of all this? Asking the house elves and the goblins for help? Telling the goblins about the horcruxes?
Harry: I don't think so. Going muggle, getting food and supplies from regular stores...that would never have occurred to Ron. That was what led us back to Grimmauld, to Kreacher and Pottery Manse.
Hermione: And to the goblins and the house elves. And without them, we would never have been able to save half the muggleborn and half bloods we have.
Harry: Yeah, that was brilliant. Getting the elves to find all the kids and their families. Because if we can't find Pottery Manse without the elves then the Death Eaters couldn't either. I’m just glad the Manse is so big. The kitchen garden alone is huge. Large enough to feed an army.
Hermione: They just can't say the name. The only one we've got left is the snake.
Harry: I still can't believe they got the diadem out of Hogwarts. Of course Dobby showing up with the sword of Gryffindor was a little bit of a shock. And hearing that Snape is on our side...
Hermione: Messes with your head. But it was certainly helpful, especially with those contacts of his. Who’d have thought Snape knew people in the military?
Harry: Oh that would have been me. But you've got to give me credit for not killing him.
Hermione: Five points to Gryffindor. He's right though, the Dark Lord keeps that snake too close.
Harry: What about poison? If we loaded up a bunch of rats or pigs or something with poison?
Hermione: We can run it by the elves. They might be able to find out who's in charge of feeding Nagini.
Harry: I think...the Sorting Hat... I think Ron was sorted for bravery. And when it comes to a fight, to the easy decisions, yeah, Ron's brave. Almost too brave with all the stupid fights. Yeah, Ron got sorted to Gryffindor for bravery. But he got sorted right away, no conversation, no thought on the Hat's part. So he never would have..."
4,6468994,Harry,Ron,"Harry: I think...the Sorting Hat...
Harry: I think Ron was sorted for bravery. And when it comes to a fight, to the easy decisions, yeah, Ron's brave. Almost too brave with all the stupid fights.
Harry: Yeah, Ron got sorted to Gryffindor for bravery. But he got sorted right away, no conversation, no thought on the Hat's part. So he never would have gotten sorted for loyalty. It never even thought he might belong in Hufflepuff.
Hermione: You're right.
Hermione: You and I, the hat talked to us, took its time. And then it sorted us. You and I...we could have been put in other houses.
Harry: I miss him.
Harry: But I don't think I'll ever be able to trust him again.
Hermione: No.
Hermione: Not with anything important.
Harry: Hermione, I've got movement at the edge of the wards,
Harry: Dobby,
Dobby: Yes Master Harry Potter sir!
Harry: We're ready for stage two. Tell McGonagall to send all the kids through the floo. Gringotts is ready for them.
Harry: I don't care who they are. If they're in uniform they shouldn't be fighting. That includes Ginny.
Neville: I'm of age Harry; you can't get rid of me that easily.
Harry: Neville I know better than to argue with you.
Harry: That doesn't mean you get a choice.
Snape: Potter,
Harry: You're just in time for the show.
Hermione: Harry, I've got more movement.
Hermione: It's Him.
Harry: Well look on the bright side. After this we can have a sandwich and a nap."
5,6468994,Hermione,Harry,"Hermione: Harry, I've got more movement. *pauses and her voice hardened* It's Him.
Harry: *sighs and helps her up, standing next to Snape with a half grin* Well look on the bright side. After this we can have a sandwich and a nap.
Snape: *sighs and gestures for them to follow him* Potter, as usual, your sense of humor leaves much to be desired.
Harry: *thinks to himself* That he was obviously trying to hide a grin had apparently unnerved the Dark Lord somewhat.
Harry: *wakes up with a start, wand instinctively in his hand, feels for Hermione beside him* I think we're okay Hermione.
Hermione: Harry?
Harry: I think we're okay Hermione.
Hermione: Kreacher?
Harry: Let's head down to the great hall, see if Snape, Flitwick and McGonagall need us for anything. Then we'll head home.
Kreacher: Master Harry called? Master must be very hungry. And tired. We will bring Master Harry and Mistress Mione home now.
Harry: No...Not just yet. Let's head down to the great hall, see if Snape, Flitwick and McGonagall need us for anything. Then we'll head home.
Kreacher: Breakfast first.
Harry: Please, let it alone? We did what we had to. And… We're not your kids."
6,6468994,Harry,Mrs. Weasley,"Harry: Mrs. Weasley. Mrs. Weasley! *had to raise his voice to get her attention* Please, let it alone? We did what we had to. And… We're not your kids.
Mrs. Weasley: You're as good as! *retorted indignantly* Who else is going to look out for you? And with you two being so close to Ron and Ginny, you may as well be part of the family.
Fred: Mum, let them be, *battered and bruised, tried to intervene*
George: Yeah Mum, give them a break would you?
Hermione: What are you doing here?
Ron: Well I came because I thought you might need me. Because I looked and looked and couldn't find you.
Hermione: You looked. *Her voice almost cracked* You looked for us but you show up now, after it's done, because we might need you.
Harry: Just like with the Hungarian Horntail. *stared at Ron* After it's all over. When it's easy. That's when you come back.
Harry: Hermione and I are going home if there's nothing else we can do here. *stared at Ron* I remember how quickly you were sorted. The Hat didn't even think twice about where to put you. You were sorted for bravery Ron. But bravery isn't worth much to me. If you were half as loyal as you are brave you'd still be one of my best friends.
Hermione: Harry let's just go.
Harry: I never told you. Because I knew you'd flip out. The Sorting Hat said I'd do well in Slytherin. I didn't like Malfoy so I asked for anywhere but Slytherin. *shook his head* I never regretted my choice. But I regret forgiving you six years of jealousy and anger. I regret curbing my abilities to keep you as my friend. Because if you were my friend you'd be happy for me when good things happen. But you never are. You're jealous. You're angry when I succeed. And that isn't a friend.
Harry: You've always been kind to me Mrs. Weasley. You opened your home to me. You never asked for anything. I love your sons and your daughter like family. I will always be grateful for your affection and hospitality. But I do have to live my life. And I cannot do that by tiptoeing around unreasonable expectations.
Percy: Mum, why don't we give Harry and Hermione a little time. They've got to be exhausted. They’ll need quiet, not bustle and worry.
Fred: That's a good idea Perce, *seconded and offered Harry a smile, albeit a tired one*
Harry: *nodded* Hermione was in the library again. Harry wasn’t sure why he found that surprising. Over the last few months they’d spent as much time as they could helping to rebuild the battled damaged Hogwarts. Strangely enough, Snape had been friendlier, saying at one point that repairing what had been broken felt better than convalescing, no matter how many house elves followed him around."
7,6468994,Harry,Hermione,"Harry: I was never much of a teacher. Not in the classroom anyway.
Hermione: You were very passionate about your subject.
Snape: Passion does not always lend itself well to patience. I would have done better with an apprentice. Not a classroom full of children whose every breath could wreak destruction. But I had no choice as to the position I was to fill.
Harry: And it’s a lot easier to teach when people want to learn your subject. When Umbridge was here who do you think actually taught DADA? I taught our group and they taught others. Otherwise no one would have passed their exams. But they wanted to learn and it was hard. I can’t imagine how hard it would be to teach a subject when no one wanted to pay attention. Even if you did have a great speech first year.
Snape: It was by far the high point of my year. Now let us fix what we so…enthusiastically broke.
Harry: No. I don’t. But I’ve always known that’s never going to be what Hermione wants. She’s a brilliant witch and she’ll be just as brilliant at anything else she chooses. She’s gone along with me for seven years, helping me. Now it’s my turn to do it for her.
Ron: So what? You’ll abandon all of us, go to muggle school, ignore magic?
Harry: It’s not like we’re going to Zimbabwe or something. But I love her. If she wants to have kids someday then we will. If she wants to get married then we will. She’s my best friend. I just want to be with her.
Hermione: Yes. Though you might consider something more polished when you decide what to tell our children about your proposal one day.
Harry: Eavesdroppers shouldn’t quibble. But I’ll take you out to dinner and then we can get a ring. How’s that?
Hermione: Suits me fine.
Ron: You’re just… just like… You can’t!
Snape: Mr. Weasley, I was under the impression that you’d come to..."
8,6468994,Ron,Snape,"Ron: “Ronald.” *sputtered like an overheating tea kettle*
Snape: “Mr. Weasley,” *drawled in his silky menacing voice*.
Snape: “You abandoned them once too often. So they have learnt that they are stronger together. And quite well suited.”
Harry: “Thanks Headmaster,” *grinned at him*.
Snape: “Think nothing of it. It was not a compliment after all, merely a statement of fact.” *nodded almost cordially*.
Hermione: “Pretty well sir.” *began to summarize their progress, tucking her arm into Harry’s and guiding him after the Headmaster, leaving Ron behind*.
Harry: *had the satisfied thought that it was where Ron belonged*."
