0,65427,Hermione,Fred Weasley,"Hermione: Oh, hullo, Fred.
Fred Weasley: Hullo, Hermione. What you reading?
Hermione: Hermione told him and was mildly surprised that the glazed look that appeared on most people's faces when she began talking about books, Harry and Ron most definitely included, didn't show up on Fred's smiling face. Instead he actually looked…interested?
Fred Weasley: Yeah? Sounds pretty cool. Maybe I'll borrow it after you're done?
Hermione: You want to borrow it?
Fred Weasley: Ah, c'mon Hermione, I can't get into trouble twenty-four hours a day now can I? Gotta have some other hobbies. Besides, I could probably get some good ideas from that book. You'd be surprised what good pranks you can adapt from the deeds of evil wizards.
Hermione: Well, I should be done with this by Friday.
Fred Weasley: Brilliant.
Hermione: What?
Fred Weasley: I'm not here to prank you!
Hermione: Alright then, are you here to ask for my help in a prank?
Fred Weasley: NO. I'm not here about a prank Hermione.
Hermione: Oh, well then, then why are you here?"
1,65427,Hermione,Fred,"Hermione: Hmm, alright then, are you here to ask for my help in a prank? *eyes narrowed in consideration*
Fred: NO. I'm not here about a prank Hermione.
Hermione: Then why are you here? *expression went from suspicious to puzzled*
Fred: How is it you can always tell me and George apart?
Hermione: Uhm, well, you do have a few different habits... like you tend to tug your right earlobe when you're irritated and George tends to run his hands through his hair. And you like to eat chocolate frogs, while George is partial to Limpey's Licorice. Little things like that. But... I think mostly it's the way you carry yourselves.
Fred: The way we carry ourselves?
Hermione: Yes. You just carry yourselves a bit differently. You sit a bit differently. You slouch a bit differently. Just a bit.
Fred: No one else can tell us apart. Even mum has trouble sometimes.
Hermione: How Mrs. Weasley puts up with the seven of you I'll never know. She has my utmost sympathy.
Fred: We keep her young.
Hermione: She says you're responsible for all the grey hairs she has.
Fred: The grey is a sign of increased youth in wizards. Being from a muggle family you might not have realized that yet.
Hermione: Well, I suppose it may be a bit odd but then I am fairly observant.
Fred: Yeah, but d'you think it might... mean something?
Hermione: Like what?
Fred: Ah, never mind. So d'you want to go with me to Hogsmeade next weekend?
Hermione: You mean, in a group, right? With Harry and Ron and George?
Fred: Uhm, no actually. I meant just with me.
Hermione: You're asking me out on a date?
Fred: Well, yeah. I mean, it's not marriage or anything. Just a date. A walk down to Hogsmeade. Some butterbeers. A visit to Honeyduke's. Not a big deal.
Hermione: *lengthy pause*"
2,65427,Fred,Hermione,"Fred: Hermione? *considering reaching over and poking the girl*
Hermione: Hello? *jumped to her feet and managed to loom over Fred* Frederick Weasley, I can't believe you thought I'd fall for such an obvious prank! What, is George standing outside the fat lady listening?
Fred: Hermione, this isn't a joke. I'm asking you out on a date!
Hermione: Right, *snorted derisively* You just suddenly decide to ask Ron's little friend out on a date. I don't think so.
Fred: Actually I've been thinking about it all year! *face red with frustration and anger* I can't believe you think I'd prank you about something like this. I wouldn't do something like that!
Hermione: Oh? *furious gaze* So that wasn't you who got Gloria Featherpeet to agree to a secret love picnic with you last year at which you failed to show up but sixteen lovestruck garden gnomes did, attracted by the scent you slipped in her perfume?
Fred: That was different! *really shouting now* Gloria Featherpeet was a total prat! She deserved it!
Hermione: *seethed* But it proved her point that Fred was asking her as another joke. Why else would he? Boys weren't interested in her. Not with her looks and she knew her manner was somewhat offputting as well. Ron was quick enough to point that out to her frequently. Oh sure, there had been Victor Krum last year but well, Victor Krum wasn't exactly your normal boy now was he? *hot tears welling up behind her eyes* you should be ashamed of yourself Fred Weasley! *pushing past him and ran up the stairs into the women's dorm*
Fred: But I was being serious!"
3,65427,George,Fred,"George: Sorry, *reaching up to weakly wipe at the tears of laughter streaming down his face.*
Fred: I can't believe she thought I was pranking her, *scowled, still feeling very much indignant at the way his proffered invitation had been thrown back in his face. His very sincere face.*
George: Well, old boy, *propping himself up on both elbows to give Fred his full attention.* I hate to say it but I think our Hermione may have some grounds for concern.
Fred: Shove off George!
George: Yes, yes, I do know that. And you know that, *he continued on.* But how, exactly, would Hermione know that? *He raised a wicked eyebrow, his smile turning a bit smug with satisfaction.* After all, brother, we do have a bit of a modest reputation at Hogwarts, don't we? In point of fact, we've spent the past six years working to earn the well-deserved and well-enjoyed reputation of being the most fearsome pranksters to ever walk the fair halls of our enchanted institution.
Fred: Yeah but Hermione should have known I'd never prank her.
George: Wellll, there was the time we…
Fred: That was before we really knew her! I wouldn't prank her now!
George: Unless it was a really brilliant prank that would only work on a reddish-brown haired female genius with a cat, *Fred clarified hastily.*
George: Y'know Fred… *he paused consideringly.* Maybe what went wrong is that you were being serious.
Fred: Y'mean…
George: Yes! *George nodded vigorously as he watched his twin link on to his own thought process.* No one expects us to be honest and genuine. You threw Hermione off guard, you did, not acting like our normal devilishly charming selves. It made her suspicious.
Fred: She was suspicious because she's a cold hearted woman destined to embrace a life of spinsterly witchhood.
George: Well, you're the one who likes her.
George: But if Fred did…well, it was his solemn duty as a twin to help him get her. And then to tease them both mercilessly once he did.
Fred: You know…you may be right brother.
George: Well, yes, of course I am, *George agreed readily.* And you would have thought of it yourself if you hadn't been so, er, involved in the matter. *He added generously.*
Fred: She's never really seen our serious side has she?
George: Exactly. So she doesn't know we have one.
Fred: So I need to convince her I am being serious by…
George: By not being serious! You need to ask her out while being yourself!
Fred: Yeah, y'know, what we really need to do is approach this like a prank.
Fred: Brilliant Planning…
George: Brilliant Strategy…
Fred: Brilliant Execution…
George: And never ever getting caught."
4,65427,Fred,George,"Fred: By not being serious! You need to ask her out while being yourself!
George: Yeah, y'know, what we really need to do is approach this like a prank.
Fred: Brilliant Planning...
George: Brilliant Strategy...
Fred: Brilliant Execution...

Ron: He what?!
Hermione: Your horrible brother asked me out as a prank!
Ron: That utter wanker!
Harry: Hermione, are you sure it was a prank?
Ron: Of course Fred was pranking her! Y'don't think Fred or George would ask Hermione out for real do you!
Hermione: Oh, thank you so very much Ronald Weasley! Obviously no one would ever want to actually go out with me! Obviously the very idea of that is just ludicrous, isn't it?
Ron: No, no, that's not what I meant Hermione. Y'know, I just meant that Fred and George tend to go for more...more...
Hermione: Oooh! You are...you are just...you horrible Weasley!
Harry: Oh, good one Ron.
Ron: Ah, shut it Harry. Y'know I didn't mean it like that.
Harry: Yeah, I know. But I think the only Weasley that Hermione's going to be talking to for awhile is Ginny.
Ron: Why are girls so bloody sensitive?
Harry: Umm, yeah...well, females are strange.
Ron: It's Fred's fault! He started it with this whole stupid date prank!
Harry: Y'know Ron, I really don't think that Fred would...
Ron: Oh, sure he would. You didn't grow up with those two, did you? You didn't have to be suspicious of every piece of candy or glass of milk that got handed to you when you were growing up. You didn't have to ask Bill to spell wards of protection into your clothes every year so they didn't suddenly turn invisible in public!
Ron: They like you Harry. They take it easy on you. But trust you me, Fred and George are dangerous and untrustworthy blokes!
Harry: Er, they're your brothers Ron.
Ron: So is Percy and he's a total git."
5,65427,Ron,Hermione,"Ron: Who d'you think you are pulling a prank like that on Hermione?
Fred: Pull what prank on Hermione?
George: *leaning back against the opposite wall with an identical expression of innocent inquiry*
Ron: You know what prank you git! You asked Hermione out on a date!
Fred: Well, yeah. I've been meaning to ask her all year you know. Swell girl is our Hermione. Brilliant brain. Cute as a button."
6,65427,Fred,Hermione,"Fred: Girl's got the sweetest smile really, a little bashful around the edge y'know? And it's cute the way she studies all the time and the way she wrinkles her nose when she's trying to solve a really thorny problem and er,…well, uhm... Bloody hell, he'd sounded way too serious there! Even worse he'd bloody been serious. Oy. Being in love was interfering with his game. Why Ron. You're not mad because you've got plans for her yourself are you?
Ron: No! Hermione's my friend and I'm looking out for her.
Fred: I dunno, he looks kind of jealous to me.
George: Y'know, I think you're right brother. There's a definite tinge of green there in his beady eyes.
Harry: C'mon Fred, Ron just wants to make sure you were serious about asking Hermione out. You were serious, weren't you. It wasn't a joke.
Fred: There, y'see Ron, Harry believes us. Harry knows my love is sincere. But you, our own brother come to us with skepticism in your tiny heart. That hurts it does. And I ain't giving her up just because you're in love with her too.
George: You could fight for her.
Fred: Well, yeah, we could. Duel it out like the manly men we are. Of course I'd hate to have to explain to Mum how little Ron got killed and all but…
Ron: I am not in love with Hermione Granger!
Fred: Methinks he doth protest a bit much.
George: Now, now George, you mustn't doubt our brother. He's blood and all. If he says he's not in love with Hermione then he's not in love with Hermione.
Ron: Yes, exactly! I'm not!
Fred: So, if Ron's not in love with Hermione then he can't really object to my dating her now can he?
George: S'true, he really can't. Well… Unless he thinks you're not good enough for the dear girl.
Fred: What d'you mean he doesn't think I'm good enough for her? Here now, who do you think you are judging me like that? Your own brother not good enough for one of your mates? That hurts it does Ronald.
Ron: No! No, I don't think you're not good enough for her. I think that…
Fred: Well good then!"
7,65427,Fred,Hermione,"Fred: Here now, who do you think you are judging me like that? Your own brother not good enough for one of your mates? That hurts it does Ronald.
Ron: No! No, I don't think you're not good enough for her. I think that…
Fred: Well good then! I'm glad you've come around, Ron, old boy. After all, family should stand by each other. Ain't that right George?
George: That's right Fred! I tell you little brother, I was getting right worried for a minute there that you were starting to take after Percy. But you've set our minds at ease, you have.
Fred: Yeah, you've set our minds at ease. And I'm sure we can count on both of you to put in a good word for old Fred here.
Ron: A good word…
Fred: I tell you George, it's really heartening to know that I can count on my brothers in my time of need.
George: Aw Fred, that's what family's for.
Fred: See you blokes at dinner, alright then?
Ron: Y'know Harry, I think under all that Fred and George speak, that Fred was actually being serious.
Harry: Yeah Ron, I think you may be right.
Ron: Fred likes Hermione.
Harry: Uh, are you okay with it?
Ron: Well, yeah, if he's serious. I mean, Fred and George can be bloody wanks but they're solid underneath you know. If Fred really likes her then he'll be good to her.
Harry: Oh, uh, that's great then.
Harry: Y'know, Fred is going to have a horrid time convincing Hermione he's really serious about this.
Ron: Hey, you're right! This is going to be brilliant!
Ron: It'll be payback for all the times those two have pranked me!"
8,65427,Fred,Ron,"Fred: Hey, you're right! This is going to be brilliant!
Ron: It'll be payback for all the times those two have pranked me!
Ron: What?
Harry: Uh, Ron...
Ron: What?
Harry: *pointed at Ron*
Ron: Oh sh…!
Ron: Dangerous and untrustworthy blokes, Harry.
Fred: Brilliant prank mates.
George: We do what we can.
Fred: Thanks mate.
George: We do what we can.
Fred: So what d'you think Hufflepuff's chances are against Ravenclaw this week?"
9,65427,Hermione,Fred,"Hermione: I should prank them all! *muttered to herself, kicking at a stray shirt*
Hermione: Should she prank them all? She should prank them all! She should give them a taste of their own blasted medicine, she should.
Hermione: But this was a special case, she argued with herself. And, well, it could almost be considered an academic pursuit. An experimental assignment of sorts. In the field.
Hermione: Hmm. If she was really serious about pranking them then what could she do? Something public but something that couldn't be traced back to her. She certainly didn't want to get caught.
Hermione: What kind of prank would be enough to teach those three a lesson? But not be too mean. She didn't want to hurt them or anything but…but what kind of prank would…her hands stilled suddenly, buried in soft ginger fur as an idea slowly began to take form.
Hermione: Oh, that was it! That was just perfect!
Hermione: Hmm, but now what would she need?
Hermione: Her mind sorting through ideas, Hermione jumped up, cuddling the purring Crookshanks in her arms. A visit to the library was definitely in order!

Fred: Yeah, he'd go and find Hermione directly after dinner and put Part I of the 'Plan' into action. *thought to himself*
Fred: If Hermione was still mad at him, well, he'd jolly her out of it. He could wait for her to cool off on her own of course, but, well, he just didn't want to.
Fred: The thought flashed briefly across Fred's mind that maybe he should try being serious with Hermione one more time but he quickly quashed the idea.
Fred: That had worked horribly, it had, being sincere. No, better to stick with what he and..."
10,65427,Hermione,Ron,"Fred: Hermione's up to something.
George: Huh? What do you mean? You mean 'up to something' up to something?
Fred: Yeah, she does look a little nervous. The first sign of the amateur mischief maker.
George: And she keeps looking our way. And she keeps sneaking glances at Ron too when he isn't looking. So what could she be feeling nervous about?
George: Maybe she's plotting to do away with you.
Fred: Oh, hah. Thanks. Nah. She's..."
11,65427,Hermione,Ron,"George: She does look a little nervous. The first sign of the amateur mischief maker.
Fred: And she keeps looking our way. And she keeps sneaking glances at Ron too when he isn't looking. So what could she be feeling nervous about?
George: Maybe she's plotting to do away with you.
Fred: Oh, hah. Thanks. Nah. She's...
Lee: What're you two going on about? Why would Hermione be plotting to do away with you?
Fred: Long story mate and she's not plotting to do away with me.
Sybill Trelawney: Oh dear…oh dear this couldn't be…!
Hermione: No. Oh no, no, no, no! Her heart stuttered like a cornered rabbit about to become a meal. No, this just couldn't be happening! How had the blasted spell gotten sent to the head table? She tried to swallow down the panic that threatened to overtake her. It had been meant for Ron and the twins. Dobby had promised he'd get it to the right goblets. He'd promised! Oh, she was going to be expelled, Hermione thought, unable to tamp down the rising hysteria bubbling up in her throat. She was never going to get a chance to take her beloved OWLS. She was never going to graduate at the top of her class. She was going to be sent home in utter disgrace!
Ron: *laughing uncontrollably*
Harry: *trying to muffle his laughter*"
12,65427,Fred,George,"Fred: It's just not possible.
George: She just wouldn't have.
Fred: I think I'm in love.
George: We have got to get that woman to work for us.
Dumbledore: Ah well, it was perhaps time to restore some order to the evening.
Dumbledore: Finite Incantatem!
Dumbledore: Finite Incantatem!
Dumbledore: Finite Incantatem!
Snape: Might I suggest we begin immediate search for the depraved culprits who no doubt will have the last name Weasley.
Dumbledore: No real harm has been done here. It was a childish prank.
Snape: Headmaster, the authority of the teaching staff has been undermined. Such reckless disrespect deserves immediate and heavy consequences."
13,65427,Dumbledore,Snape,"Dumbledore: No real harm has been done here. It was a childish prank.
Snape: Headmaster, the authority of the teaching staff has been undermined. Such reckless disrespect deserves immediate and heavy consequences.
McGonnagal: This is really going too far Albus. There must be consequences for the guilty parties. Perhaps not death.
Dumbledore: But the consequences will be determined with cool and thoughtful heads.
Ron: That was completely brilliant! I wonder how they pulled it off?
Harry: You think it was them then?
Ron: Of course. Who else but Fred and George could pull something like this.
Harry: D'you think they'll get in much trouble for it?
Hermione: Oh Harry, I…I…I
Harry: Hermione? Are you all right?
Ron: You're not going to throw up are you?
Harry: Do you need some air?
Ron: Was it the sight of Snape in a bikini?
Hermione: It wasn't Fred and George."
14,65427,Ron,Fred,"Ron: Well, what is it then? Fred and George have just pulled off the most brilliant prank of their careers. What're you having a mental breakdown about?
Hermione: It wasn't Fred and George.
Ron: What? Of course it was Fred 'n George. Who else could it have been?
Hermione: It was me.
Ron: Oh, c'mon, don't be stupid. Of course it wasn't you. Come up with something more believable why don't you? Like, I dunno, like you becoming the head seeker for Ireland.
Harry: Hermione, are you telling me you really are behind this prank?
Hermione: I didn't mean to do it Harry. It was an accident.
Harry: You accidentally transformed Professor Trelawney into a hairy giant, Professor Snape into a…a, well, half a female, and Professor Dumbledore into a belly dancing old woman? How, exactly, does that happen by accident?
Hermione: It was meant for Ron and the twins.
Ron: It was what? It was meant for what? Are you telling me you really are the one behind this prank? And what do you mean it was meant for me and the twins?
Hermione: I mean it was intended for you three imbeciles.
Ron: Which one was I supposed to be?
Hermione: You were supposed to be the ugly, oafish, hairy ape. That way your outsides would have finally matched your great big stupid insides!
Harry: Come on guys, that's not important now.
Ron: Not important? She was going to turn me into a hairy ape man! And she just called me stupid!
Harry: Well, compared to her, we are stupid. Anyway, we've got to make sure Hermione doesn't get caught.
Hermione: Oh Harry, I'm going to be expelled.
Ron: *remains silent*
Harry: Alright, first thing first, how did a spell that was meant for Ron and the twins end up affecting the Head Table?
Hermione: I don't know. I swear I don't know.
Harry: Well, how did you plan to get them to Ron and the twins?
Hermione: I got Dobby to help me.
Harry: You're sure Dobby knew exactly where to send the spells?
Hermione: Of course I'm sure. He knows perfectly well who Ron and the twins are and I most assuredly did not tell him to send it up to the Head Table.
Harry: I don't know how Dobby could have made a mistake like that."
15,65427,Harry,Dobby,"Harry: You're sure Dobby knew exactly where to send the spells?
Hermione: Of course I'm sure. He knows perfectly well who Ron and the twins are and I most assuredly did not tell him to send it up to the Head Table.
Harry: I don't know how Dobby could have made a mistake like that.
Ron: Why don't you ask him?
Harry: What?
Ron: Why don't you ask him? Dobby worships you Harry. Just ask him.
Harry: That's a really good idea, actually. *hesitating* Dobby!
Dobby: Oh, Harry Potter, there has been a most terrible mistake made. It is not Dobby's doing sir, it is not!
Harry: It's alright Dobby. Hermione told us she asked you to send up some spells into Ron and the twins' goblets. We just want to know how they ended up at the head table.
Dobby: Oh, Harry Potter, Sir! It is too terrible. Dobby should have prevented…but it was Winky Sir!
Harry: Winky?
Hermione: I've never done anything to Winky. I've tried to be nice to her.
Dobby: Winky does not like Harry Potter's female friend at all Sir! Winky is wanting to cause trouble for her.
Harry: You're talking about S.P.E.W. aren't you Dobby?
Dobby: Yes, Harry Potter, sir! Winky is a sly and unworthy Elf and she stole the spells from Dobby and sent them to the Great Table instead.
Harry: Stop that Dobby, it wasn't your fault.
Hermione: I'm going to be expelled because of Winky.
Harry: You're not going to be expelled. You're the top student in our year. You never get in trouble...
Ron: Uh, unless, it's because of us.
Harry: And Professor Dumbledore would never expel you.
Ron: Of course, Snape'll probably try to make your life a living hell…
Hermione: *groans*
Harry: Alright look Dobby..."
16,65427,Harry Potter,Dobby,"Harry: Alright look Dobby, *looked down at the house elf who had stopped trying to ram himself against the desk and was now twisting his own ear viciously, squeaking at the pain.* Stop that! *ordered irritably, reaching out to grab Dobby's hand and wrestle it away from his ear.* Dobby you can still help us, *ordered somewhat desperately as the house elf began trying to bite his own arm.*
Dobby: Dobby can be of use?
Harry: Yes! *said firmly.* Look, the only way the professors can figure out who was behind the prank is if they question the house elves right?
Ron: Yeah! *straightened up, catching on to what Harry was getting at.* You're right. How else would they be able to tell who did it?
Harry: Professor Dumbledore will probably figure out that the spell was in the goblets so it figures if he wants to know who was behind it he'll go down to the kitchens, *went on.*
Dobby: Oh, Harry Potter, Sir, Dobby cannot be lying to Albus Dumbledore. And Winky would also not lie. She will most happily tell any who ask that it was the best female friend of Harry Potter who gave the spells.
Harry: Yeah, *muttered frowning in thought.* But, you don't have to answer if you aren't there do you?
Dobby: Harry Potter is wanting Dobby to go away?
Harry: No, not go away, Dobby, *reassured him hastily.* Just hide out for a little while. I mean you're a free elf right? You and Winky both are, so you could sort of pop off somewhere else for awhile couldn't you? *He asked hopefully.*
Dobby: The Great Professor Dumbledore did tell me that I could be having 'vacation' when I first started my working in the kitchens.
Harry: Yeah! Yeah, a vacation! *smiled encouragingly.* You and Winky should definitely take a little vacation. Go off and visit, uh, somewhere.
Ron: Hang on, *interrupted.* Won't Winky get in trouble if she tells the truth? I mean, Hermione meant to prank the twins and me, *at this he couldn't resist shooting Hermione a nasty glare.* So if she tells Professor Dumbledore what really happened, she's likely to get fired herself ain't she?
Hermione: Oh Ron, the Professor would never do something like that, *chided him, beginning to look a little calmer again.*
Ron: Well, yeah, of course he wouldn't, *shook his head impatiently.* But Winky don't know that now does she?
Harry: Yeah Ron! *smiled enthusiastically.* You're right. If Dobby tells Winky that she'll get fired if she lets on to what happened, then she'll probably be willing to make herself scarce for a few days until this blows over. I mean she doesn't have anywhere else to go right? *He added somewhat heartlessly, feeling little sympathy for Winky right then.*
Hermione: Oh, but that would be wrong… *protested weakly.* Bullying Winky like that.
Ron: Bollocks that! *interjected furiously.* That house elf tried to get you into trouble and all you've ever tried to do is help her. *He manfully bit back the urge to say that he'd thought the whole S.P.E.W. thing was idiotic from the start.*
Harry: Yeah, Hermione, *hurried to head off any fits of conscience.* Winky's brought this on herself. And we're not hurting her or anything. Maybe a few days off would do her some good.
Hermione: Yeah, she could check into a Sanitarium, *Ron muttered.*
Hermione: Well, I suppose you're right, *agreed hesitantly.* But… *she paused considering.* Don't you think that Dumbledore might figure it out anyway?
Harry: Yeah, he probably could if he really wanted to, *admitted.* But the thing is I don't think he'll really care all that much. As long as it's not really obvious I bet he'll let it slide. *Harry smiled slightly, recalling some*"
17,65427,Ron,Hermione,"Ron: I want to talk to you, *muttered*
Hermione: Well, I suppose you're right, *agreed hesitantly*.
Hermione: But… *paused considering*.
Harry: Yeah, he probably could if he really wanted to, *admitted*.
Harry: But the thing is I don't think he'll really care all that much. As long as it's not really obvious I bet he'll let it slide. *smiled slightly*.
Harry: Snape might not, but…well, he hates us anyway and he'll have to take his cue from Dumbledore.
Harry: so it's agreed then, *looked around at the others*.
Ron: *nodded vigorously*.
Hermione: *nodded weakly as well*.
Harry: What do you think Dobby? Can you do it?
Dobby: Dobby will do as Harry Potter has asked. Dobby will take a, *his eyes widened slightly in awe*, a 'vacation.' *His face firmed*. And he will take Winky with him.
Fred: It's the only way it all fits, *concluded, pausing mid-stride, as he shook his head in bemused wonder*.
George: Yeah, you're right, it makes perfect sense, *agreed solemnly before hooting in appreciative laughter*.
George: Trust Hermione to pull off the prank of the year by accident, *he snorted, shaking his head in amused disbelief*.
Fred: *shot his twin a narrow-eyed glare before his own equally bizarre sense of humor surfaced and he reluctantly grinned*.
George: You realize she meant the prank for us, *he commented wryly*.
George: Yeah, well, *George flashed a grin at his twin*. If you can't take a prank…
Fred: Don't pull a prank, *Fred finished, grinning back with an identical wicked smile*.
Fred: Hermione's not cut out to be in trouble, *frowned at the thought of the sweet girl slaving away in detention*.
Fred: *His imagination continued to build the picture of Snape with an evil sneer of triumph on his cold face casting hexes and jinxes at Hermione while she was forced to slave away in the deepest dankest castle dungeon, faint with hunger, cleaning out noxious potion vial after potion vial night after night*.
George: Not cut out to be in trouble? Girl seems to have a positive genius for trouble if you ask me, *raised an arched eyebrow, skepticism plain on his devilish face*.
Fred: Yeah, she really does, doesn't she? *felt his smile go goofish for a minute before shaking it off*. You know that's not what I meant. I meant that Hermione's not cut out to serve detentions or get yelled at, or well, be on Snape's 'death by Potion's' list.
George: *straightened up, casting a narrow-eyed gaze of concern at his brother*. Hold on now, *he protested*. For one, the girl did the crime, she can do the time, *George thought of some of the stunts she, Ron and Harry had pulled in previous years*. She's a tough little thing y'know. And, *he continued hurriedly when it looked like Fred was going to try to cut in*, she's already on Snape's 'Death by Potion's' list just by being best mates with Harry. So don't, *he plowed on, ruthlessly overrunning Fred's attempts to speak*, even think about getting all..."
18,65427,George,Fred,"George: She's a tough little thing y'know. And she's already on Snape's 'Death by Potion's' list just by being best mates with Harry. So don't even think about getting all chivalrous and gentlemanly on us. We are not chivalrous and gentlemanly blokes.
Fred: She's just so tiny.
George: Too tiny? Your argument is that she's too tiny? Love is rotting your brains mate! I mean, have you gone completely mental? The girl was clever enough to get into this mess wasn't she? I'm sure she's clever enough to get out of it all on her own.
Fred: She's not used to being devious though. I mean, she messed up the prank didn't she?
George: Yeah! She did! Or else it would have been us turning into belly-dancing old ladies and what-not! Have you forgotten that? And I haven't even done anything! Besides, this is Hermione Granger we're talking about! She's the smartest witch we've ever met! Uh, don't tell her I said that though.
George: Don't you dare say she's tiny again or I'll pound you! Just forget it! Whatever you're thinking of doing just forget it!
Fred: But...
George: No!
Fred: I only...
George: I mean it! The answer's no!
Fred: I wonder if Genevieve Delorean ever found out who it was that stole her Feather of Love enchantment and replaced it with a Feather of sneezing?
George: We vowed never to speak of that!
Fred: Desperate measures mate.
George: You want to play that game then do you? Alright then. Oy, I bet Dad would love to know who it was behind that Muggle two-headed bovine emergency that kept his entire department out in the countryside chasing cows for five bloody nights straight last year.
Fred: Well I wonder how Mum would feel if she found out who it was put Draught of belching into Aunt Marge's biscuits two years ago. Right before they were entered into the Portnash baking contest.
George: Ginny still don't know it was you what chained the gremlin to her bed when she was six. And that girl…is getting dangerous.
Fred: Ho, I wonder if Charlie would like to know about the time you got Roddy Griffith's cousin to tell Charlie he was an orphan and that the Slytherin Orphanage for Wayward Fiends was going to take him away the next morning?
George: That was both of us!
George: This is getting us nowhere.
Fred: Yeah, you're right. We've got too much dirt on each other. Neither of us would survive full disclosure.
George: Alright look, you're worried for your lady-love right? I mean, obviously. It's making you so mental that you're actually threatening your own deeply beloved brother.
Fred: S'right."
19,65427,Fred,George,"Fred: Yeah, you're right, *nodded reluctantly, also leaning back*. We've got too much dirt on each other. Neither of us would survive full disclosure.
George: Alright look, *said after another moment of silence as they both analyzed the possibilities*. You're worried for your lady-love right? I mean, obviously. It's making you so mental that you're actually threatening your own deeply beloved brother.
Fred: S'right, *agreed readily*. Which is why…
George: Aw, shut it and listen, *interrupted irritably*. We don't even know she's going to get caught, do we?
Fred: Well…Dumbledore and Snape'll probably…
George: Forget probably… *overrode*. Before we cast ourselves on the sword of love, and by the way you are going to so owe me big time for this…
Fred: Yeah, yeah, *responded impatiently*.
George: Right…as I was saying, before we get all noble let's find out if our monumental act of sacrifice is really needed shall we?
Fred: *huffed impatiently*. Fine. But I don't think Hermione's going to be willing to talk to either of us right now.
George: Yeah, *nodded in agreement*. Shame you didn't get a chance to put the 'Hermione will be yours' plan into action yet. Still, Ron and Harry…
Fred: Yeah, *nodded*. That's true. Ron and Harry should know what's what. Well… *reconsidered*. maybe just Harry since the last we saw, Hermione wasn't talking to Ron neither.
George: Right. Okay, so we corner Harry and find out if Hermione's in danger of getting caught, *concluded*.
Fred: And if she is… *asked, one eyebrow waggling questioningly at his brother*.
George: *stared at him in irritation for a brief moment before finally shrugging his surrender*. Fine! If it looks like she's going to get caught and if there's no other alternative that presents itself then we take credit for the crime. But like I said, you're going to owe me…
Fred: Big time! *agreed hurriedly, flashing his brother a brilliant smile*. He'd known George would come through in the end. With his brothers' consent taken care of he jerked his head towards the far end of the hall, eager to be off. Right then, let's go!
George: *watched Fred take off at full speed in his search for Harry, shaking his head slowly in dismay*. The idiot really is in love, *he concluded morosely*. Won't get a decent prank out of him until this thing settles down. Sighing, *he wandered more slowly after his brother, his twisty mind still considering options*. His face brightened momentarily when a though struck him and he shouted after Fred Oy Fred! What about trying to blame it on the Slytherins?
Fred: *was still a bit ahead of George as he entered the Gryffindor common rooms*. Immediately the crowd of Gryffindors hanging out began a rousing cheer for one of their temporary heroes. Fred, as distracted as he was, was still enough of a showman to smile and bow to the crowd of students, raising his arms in grand acceptance of the adulation, taking it as his natural due. Thank you! Thank you! But really, I'm just a normal lad. Like all of you except, well, taller and more charming and well, better looking of course… *he laughed as the crowd started good-naturedly cat-calling him, the closer students shoving at him playfully*.
Fred: Hey Neville! *He reached out and collared the awkward lad*. Have you seen Harry anywhere?
Neville: Oh, uh, I think he might've left dinner early, *Neville replied, a bit nervous*. Any time the notorious pranksters noticed him he felt a bit nervous. Although, really, they were usually pretty decent to him. Not that they didn't prank him 'cause, well, this was Fred and George and they pranked everybody. But it was always good-natured. It was the Slytherins you had to watch out for. He was with Ron and Hermione. I'm not sure where they went though. Haven't seen them up here, *Neville offered tentatively*.
Fred: Well, d'you have any idea where they might have gone? It's kind of important, *Fred asked, the unusually serious expression on his face impressing the younger boy*.
Neville: Well… *Neville frowned in consideration before brightening*. Hey! The library! The three of them seem to hang out in the library quite a lot.
Fred: The library? *Fred considered and then nodded*."
20,65427,Fred,Harry,"Fred: Oy, Harry, is Hermione in trouble?
Harry: Wh...what do you mean?
Fred: C'mon, don't be coy. We know it was Hermione who was behind that prank.
George: Yeah, we know it was Hermione who was behind that prank.
Harry: Why do you think it was Hermione?
Fred: Well, it wasn't us.
Harry: Er, well, okay, but there's still lots of other people in the school. What makes you think Hermione could possibly have had anything to do with it?
Fred: Look, you know she was mad at me 'cause she thought I was pranking her when I asked her out earlier.
Harry: Yeah.
Fred: Well, I was watching her when she came in at supper and she was up to something. I could tell.
Harry: How?
Fred: I just could.
Harry: Okay.
Fred: Look, it's not important how I know, I just do. She meant the prank for us and Ron...
George: Yeah, I know why she's mad at us but what did that git do to get on Hermione's bad side?
Harry: Uh, well, he sort of...
Fred: That don't matter now."
21,65427,Fred,Hermione,"Harry: Well, he sort of...
Fred: That don't matter now.
George: *rolled his eyes*
Fred: We know she meant the prank for us and it somehow hit the head table instead. What we need to know is whether there's any evidence to link her to the prank.
Harry: Okay Fred, you're right. It was Hermione behind the prank. But you can't tell anyone.
Fred: Of course we're not going to tell anyone. We're here to help make sure she don't get caught.
George: Yeah! This git won't rest until he makes sure Hermione don't get in trouble! On account of he's soooo in love with her.
Harry: But Fred asked Hermione out as a prank didn't he?
Fred: You know I was serious when I was asking her out! I've been thinking about asking her since this summer!
Harry: Just what exactly is it about Hermione that you like so much?
Fred: What's not to like? She's just, she's just wonderful alright? She's brilliant and funny and sweet and pretty and clever and by Merlin's Beard she just pulled off the prank of the year by accident! And if she's in trouble then George and I'll take care of it! We'll take credit for the prank if we have to alright? But we need the details so we can figure out how to fix it!
Harry: She's not in danger of getting caught Fred. But you can ask her yourself.
Fred: Oh, um, Hermione...hi.
Hermione: *silent, studying Fred's face with serious intent*
Fred: Y'see I...well, that is, I really just...
Hermione: *smiling*
Fred: Yeah?
Hermione: Would you like to go out with me this weekend?
Fred: Yeah. Yeah, I'd like that. A lot.
Hermione: I'm sorry I tried to prank you."
22,65427,Fred,Hermione,"Fred: Yeah. Yeah, I'd like that. A lot.
Hermione: I'm sorry I tried to prank you. I'm really, really sorry Fred.
Fred: Don't be sorry about it Hermione. That was a brilliant prank. You'll have to tell me how you did it.
Hermione: Well, do you really think it was brilliant?
Fred: Are you kidding? It was outstanding! Only a brilliant witch like you could have pulled that off.
George: Oy! Hermione! I was willing to go down for you too y'know! I dunno why you want to ask this shady character out.
George: By the way, could I interest you in a part-time job this year? Extra cash, lot's of practical applications of magic. We could use a good assistant. Uh, I mean, colleague. A really smart colleague to help us out with development and research.
Harry: Y'know, if Fred 'n George convince Hermione to team up with them…well, I fear for the world Harry. I really do.
Harry: Well, at least the world will be laughing."
