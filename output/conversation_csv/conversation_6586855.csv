0,6586855,Harry,Winky,"Harry: Winky, could you pass me the sugar, please? *Harry rubs the ingredients together to form a ball of dough* Thank you. Now, I'll set this dough aside in the refrigerator.

Winky: *cleans along beside Harry*

Dobby: *turns on the music-player* Time for some Baroque music, Harry!

Harry: *washes his hands again* Thanks, Dobby. It's going to be another nice, relaxing morning."
1,6586855,Harry,Winky,"Harry: Winky, I need your help, if you don't mind. Can you do the crumb coating for the cakes and then ice the cupcakes? -- You know where the list is.
Winky: Winky would be very pleased to help Master Harry!
Harry: Thank you, Winky.
Winky: Winky is happy to do as Master needs.
Harry: Almost time to open, Master Harry. And this needs done!
Harry: When the breads are done, can you put them in their baskets and stock them out front?"
2,6586855,Harry,Winky,"Harry: Almost time to open, Master Harry, she said. And this needs done!
Harry: When the breads are done, can you put it them in their baskets and stock them out front? Harry asked.
Winky: Great, good. Ask Dobby to brew the coffee too, please, he replied to her nod.
Winky: Dobby is a good elf, she responded before popping away.
Harry: Yes, he really is, he said to no one before he began to decorate.
Harry: As he stepped behind the serving counter, with its rows of pretty baked goods beneath glass surfaces, his first customer of the day walked in."
3,6586855,Severus Snape,Minerva McGonagall,"Severus Snape: Do be still, Severus, Minerva said gently as she stared at him. You are staring again, Minerva, Severus responded, not unkindly. It is difficult for me to be still, these days, whilst being stared at.
Minerva McGonagall: You used to be so poised and composed, Severus. Hardly giving a thing away, let alone nerves. What brings you to my door on such a cold, October evening?
Severus Snape: I have somewhat of a....problem, and I need your help. It has come to my attention that you are the acting leader of the Order of the Phoenix. That it was not disbanded. I felt it...possible, quite probable, that you might have the information I need, he said at last.
Minerva McGonagall: What is it that you need my help with, Severus?
Severus Snape: I need to find someone, and I have...I have depleted all of my sources of their information and still I have not found...whom it is that I seek, Severus explained.
Minerva McGonagall: When your portrait never filled in, beyond the lab and books, we had assumed you were still alive, somewhere. I am pleased to find you so well, Minerva said evasively.
Severus Snape: Severus lifted a hand to the pale scars on his neck and rubbed them slightly. Yes. I....it was rather a near thing. In fact, in order to recover from the....incident, I was technically dead for an entire twenty-four hours, he replied.
Minerva McGonagall: I am sorry to say that there are those that still believe you to be dead, however, Minerva explained.
Severus Snape: Ah. Yes. I....that is best, in many cases. My life is very quiet, and I like it the way that it is, for the most part, Severus said quietly. I do not wish to disturb anyone's life, Minerva, but I must find him. Will..."
4,6586855,Harry,Minerva,"Harry: I am sorry to say that there are those that still believe you to be dead, however.
Minerva: Ah. Yes. I....that is best, in many cases. My life is very quiet, and I like it the way that it is, for the most part.
Severus: I do not wish to disturb anyone's life, Minerva, but I must find him. Will you not help?
Minerva: Who is it that you seek?
Severus: Mr. Potter. Harry. I need to find him. Do you have any leads?
Minerva: Mr. Potter left the wizarding world four years ago and has not been seen, nor heard of, since, Severus.
Severus: That does not mean that you do not know where he is, Minerva.
Minerva: No, it doesn't. Are you sure you need to know?
Severus: Yes.
Minerva: Very well. Go lightly on him, when you find him, Severus. He is damaged. And he is not aware that I have known where he is, that I have visited him. Please do your best to not disturb the peaceful life he has tried so hard to create.
Severus: I give you my word, Minerva, that I need to find him and that I will do my best not to cause him undue harm or turmoil.
Minerva: There's the address. If you have need of work, I do have the post of Deputy Headmaster available. It doesn't pay as much as a Professorship, but....it's yours if you want it.
Severus: That won't be necessary, Minerva. Thank you, for this.
Minerva: He is happy, with his life such as it is, and he is very, very good at his craft, Severus. Don't be too unkind. He has suffered....a great deal.
Severus: I won't be unkind, Minerva. I need his help. What is Pottering?
Minerva: You'll find out soon enough."
5,6586855,Severus,Mrs. Greer,"Severus: Good morning, Mrs. Greer! *greets as he moves back behind the counter and washes his hands* What'll it be today?
Mrs. Greer: I do love your Saturdays, Mr. Fleamont, *replies as she looks over the case* I'm going to clean you out of the free bread rolls today, my dear, I have company coming 'round for lunch. Ah, and I'll buy half-a-dozen of the banana, peanut-butter cupcakes, please.
Severus: *grins and takes out two bakery boxes* Anything else? *totals up the prices for each and quotes her the price*
Mrs. Greer: No, dearie. That will do me today, *replies as she takes the bag of goods he handed her in exchange for her payment*
Mrs. Greer: *calls back over her shoulder* Make sure you get out into this beautiful Saturday weather we're having, young man!
Severus: *laughs a little and prepares to wait on the next customer*"
6,6586855,Severus,Hermione,"Severus: Master Snape, *opened the door*.
Ophelia Thornton: Miss Thornton, *led Severus into the house and then into the first-floor parlour on the right-hand side*.
Severus: Is Lady Malfoy at home?
Ophelia Thornton: Yes, of course, *led Severus into the house and then into the first-floor parlour on the right-hand side*.
Draco: Godfather, to what do we owe the pleasure?
Severus: *turned and nearly let his mouth drop open at the sight of Hermione*.
Hermione: Carrying twin boys, *rubbed her rather-large belly*.
Hermione: I've sent Miss Greeves for tea, Master Snape, if you'd sit.
Severus: *nodded, but directed his reply to Draco* I need a bit of assistance and was hoping your lovely wife might accommodate me.
Hermione: Is it relating to legal advice? Are you in need of a solicitor?
Severus: No. Not as such. I merely hoped you might have some information for me. I am looking for someone.
Hermione: Who is it you're looking for, Master Snape?
Hermione: You may call me Severus, Lady Malfoy.
Hermione: And as I have said before, you may call me Hermione, Severus.
Draco: What's going on, Severus?
Severus: I need to find Harry Potter. I...I wanted to know what you, both of you, know about him now and what he did after the war.
Hermione: Why?
Severus: *stood slowly* I need to find Harry Potter. I...I wanted to know what you, both of you, know about him now and what he did after the war."
7,6586855,Severus,Harry Potter,"Severus: I need to find Harry Potter. I...I wanted to know what you, both of you, know about him now and what he did after the war, *said after a long moment.*
Hermione: Why? *asked as she applied herself to her plate.*
Severus: *stood slowly.* He really hadn't wanted it to come to this, but he felt as though he owed Draco and Hermione a forthright, honest answer. He undid the cuff-link on his right wrist and slowly pulled up the sleeve. Then, he unclasped a thick, black band from around his wrist. He had kept his soulmate mark hidden since he'd received it - at age eleven. He'd bared it to no one, save Headmaster Dumbledore. *He approached Hermione slowly and then practically shoved his wrist in her face. At her gasp, he pulled back, snapped the band back in place and righted his sleeve.* Harry James Potter was written in slanted, cramped printing in colours that ranged from gold to brown to maroon, on the inside of his wrist.
Hermione: Has it always been Harry? *asked.*
Severus: *shook his head and sat back down.* No. It changed to his name during his first-ever Potions class.
Draco: Your soulmate is Harry bloody Potter? *asked, incredulous.*
Severus: *nodded.*
Draco: But it used to be someone else? *continued.*
Severus: *Again, Severus could only nod.*
Draco: Who? *asked.*
Hermione: Lily Evans, *said softly.* It could be no other. She was the soulmate of two people?
Severus: Yes. Until her death, *replied.*
Hermione: *sat back against the chair and then nodded.* For the entire first year after the war, Harry helped rebuild Hogwarts and attended certain trials. He gave testimony in some, and weight towards sentencing in others. Then, he went with Ron and I, and others, to finish his education when Hogwarts re-opened. At the end of what is affectionately termed Eighth Year, he vanished.
Severus: Alright. Is there anything else you know that you can tell me? *asked.*
Hermione: *sighed and then slashed out with her wand and muttered the summoning charm.* He cleaned out two of his Gringott's accounts and one of the Black accounts as well. The others were monitored for a while, by the Auror's office, and it seemed as though he'd been getting updates on the remaining accounts. One was entirely diverted to Hogwarts. Another was entirely invested in a large orphanage. His taxes were monitored for a long while as well, and the only thing that has been reported on them in the last four years is Black Manor, the interest from investments, Sleekeazy's and a sum of money deposited monthly, from Aberforth's.
Severus: Aberforth's? As in Aberforth Dumbledore? *asked.* The Hog's Head?
Hermione: *nodded.* It's called Aberforth's now. Harry worked there, contributed a few menu items, redesigned the business for Aberforth, really, while he was helping to rebuild Hogwarts. It's a themed restaurant now. Every menu item contains some form of goat's milk. It's a restaurant by day and a pub by night, now. Harry helped do that. He helped a lot, just after the war, with revitalizing Hogsmeade and Diagon Alley, things like that.
Severus: After all of that, he just...fled? *asked.*
Draco: It appears so, *added.* Hermione and I discovered we were soulmates during Eighth year. Ronald and Hermione broke up a few months before that. Miss Lovegood went to University in New York, in America. Neville Longbottom and George Weasley began courting, due to their soulmate bond. Seamus Finnegan and Dean Thomas got married right after we graduated.
Hermione: People's lives moved on where Harry's just seemed to...stop. Ginny and Blaise found out they were soulmates just before Harry left too. I think...I think it was all very hard for him. He wanted to move on with his life. He never, not once, mentioned having a soulmate mark. I think everyone just assumed he...didn't, *said.*
Severus: He may not, *said quietly.*
Draco: *added.* Yes, I have read that can happen.
Severus: What about his friendships with you and Mr. Weasley? *asked.*
Hermione: We just drifted. Ronald hated the fact that I am Draco's soulmate. And we never really recovered our friendship after our...relationship. Still, Harry tried to take care of us. He tried to take care of all of us. Ronald and his wife, Lavender, live at Black Manor with Teddy and Andromeda Black-Tonks. Harry testified at Draco's trial, at mine, at Ron's."
8,6586855,Draco,Severus,"Draco: What about his friendships with you and Mr. Weasley?
Severus: We just drifted. Ronald hated the fact that I am Draco's soulmate. And we never really recovered our friendship after our...relationship. Still, Harry tried to take care of us. He tried to take care of all of us. Ronald and his wife, Lavender, live at Black Manor with Teddy and Andromeda Black-Tonks. Harry testified at Draco's trial, at mine, at Ron's, at a lot of others as well. He tried to fix as much as he could, but...I think he felt like it was never enough,

Hermione: The Ministry put you on trial?
Severus: While we were rebuilding Hogwarts, yes,
Hermione: A lot of members of the Order of the Phoenix were tried -- mostly for misuse of magic or for use of restricted or Unforgivable magic,
Draco: Benenine Isle, off the coast of Northern Ireland, was converted into a Prison. Death Eaters and Death Eater Sympathizers were held at Azkaban, with the remaining Dementors, while all other people, if they were sentenced, were sent to Benenine Isle.
Hermione: Molly Weasley did six-months at Benenine for Unforgivable Curse use. I did three months for the use of Restricted magic,
Draco: The Ministry believed the only person actually exempt from Prison time, from punishment, was Harry Potter -- as he'd saved our whole world. Everyone else was tried. If found guilty, you served a sentence. My trial was early in the year,

Severus: How did I get a full pardon?
Hermione: It was assumed you were dead. Harry used your memories, as well as a vial of memories Headmistress McGonagall had from Dumbledore, as well as statements by students and other evidence that we were not made privy to, to clear your name. Harry had Minister Breakenbatch include in the pardon that it would apply regardless of the status of your life -- living or dead. We're not sure what else he did to ensure your freedom, should you be found alive. He never told us,
Severus: Alright,

Draco: My mother did six months at Azkaban for Death Eater activity, even though she never took the Mark. My father is still there - and will be, for the rest of his life. He was not able to claim the Imperius curse again, because the Ministry devised a way to tell for sure. A three-part method to see if you have been under the Imperius curse,
Severus: Why did we not speak of this before?
Draco: You were just getting back on your feet,
Hermione: You needed time. We wanted to wait until you asked,

Severus: Alright. Is there anything more you know about Mr. Potter?
Hermione: If you want more information, you should go eat at Aberforth's. Also, you could speak to Ronald. Considering he lives in Harry's house, he might know more,
Severus: I will,

Hermione: What did he, Harry, study in his final year?
Severus: He took core classes, and a couple of the new classes. He took his NEWTS. He did really well on them, though I'm sure he isn't aware of it. He worked for Aberforth on the weekends. We...we didn't see him much. Everyone else was working hard too, and when we weren't...we all kind of paired off. I hate to say it, to even feel it, but...we fell down on the job. We left him alone.
Draco: It was not your job to look after him, Hermione,
Hermione: Wasn't it?

Hermione: When you find him...tell him we miss him,
Severus: If that's all, I'll be on my way. I still have things to do today,
Hermione: When you find him...tell him we miss him,

Severus: As Severus left, he wondered if he should have told them where Harry was. Well, where Minerva thought he was, actually. It would be a long trip to Belfast, actually. Better to stop by Black Manor first and see if Ronald Weasley had any more information. Would talking to Ronald be worth it? Should he take such a risk when he..."
9,6586855,Severus,Luna,"Severus: Miss Lovegood, he said softly.
Luna: Master Snape, it's Mrs. Scamander now, she replied.
Severus: May I come in?
Luna: You're here about Harry, said Luna.
Severus: Of course, came Severus's reply.
Luna: Stella! Luna called with a sort of giddy laugh.
Stella: Mistress Scamander? she asked in a soft, whisper of a voice.
Luna: Bring tea, please. The almond, Severus prefers it. And the little chocolate biscuits, please, Luna requested. And please let Rolf know I'll be up here, in the main house, for longer than we'd planned.
Severus: You have servants. I hadn't expected that, Severus commented.
Luna: Just Stella, actually. We have a couple of interns too, to help with the animals, but, really, Severus, this isn't what you came here for. You want to know about Harry and about me and Harry, she said.
Severus: You aren't surprised at my being alive, he stated.
Luna: I'm a Seer, so, no I wasn't the least bit surprised, Luna responded. Now, ask what you came here to ask. You're among friends, it's okay.
Severus: If you knew you weren't soulmates, why did you and Harry...become partners?
Luna: That isn't exactly what you want to know. What you want to know is if he has your name written on his body, and I can't tell you that. Luna sighed. I can tell you that he was an excellent lover, for that time period and that age. I can tell you I loved him and he loved me, but we were never in love. I can tell you he does have a soulmate mark, but he kept it hidden the entire time we were together.
Severus: Did you discuss me, at any point? Severus asked.
Luna: He often spoke of you. How he wished he'd understood you, your role, during his education. How he wished he'd been able to talk to you, back then. He commiserated your passing, and could not believe me when I told him there was a..."
10,6586855,Severus,Luna,"Severus: I want to talk to you. *sat across the street on a park bench*
Luna: I am a partner in his bakery, but I don't go giving out his address or location, Severus. If you want to locate him, you'll have to ask someone else or find it on your own.
Severus: So he does own a bakery then?
Luna: Yes. He does very well. He's very skilled, and he seems happy. I get an update once a month and I get a percentage of the profits. I occasionally help review the menu items or help him decide on a way to go. Rolf's father's godfather is a baker, here in New York. So, we do communicate fairly regularly. I think I'm the only magickal person he talks to aside from his House Elves.
Severus: He has House Elves?
Luna: Dobby and Winky and Kreacher are all bound to him. He saved Dobby's life.
Severus: They help him, then?
Luna: He's as alone as he could get.
Severus: Thank you for the tea and biscuits, Miss Lovegood. I think I'll be going now.
Luna: Tell him hello from me, and that he's loved. He'll get past it, Severus. Faster than you might think. But, if you never start, if you never try, then the two of you will miss out on something wonderful.
Severus: Thank you for the advice.
Luna: You have my blessing, if it matters to you, Severus.
Severus: It matters. Thank you.
Luna: Anytime."
11,6586855,Severus,Harry,"Severus: That's quite alright, Mr. Potter. I have no need for your shop to be open for what I need.
Harry: I'm really sorry, but we're just about to close.
Severus: An excellent sentiment, Mr. Potter. Now that the dramatics are over, could you perhaps continue in your closing duties so that we might talk?
Harry: Are you real?
Severus: I am, indeed, real, Mr. Potter.
Harry: Tell me something about you that only I would know.
Severus: You once invaded my privacy by looking into my pensieve during Occlumency lessons. But, what you learned there changed a fundamental part of your world and I should have tried harder to teach you.
Harry: Another. Another thing, please.
Severus: The last thing I wanted to do, before I succumbed to the coma, though you thought I was dying, was to look into your eyes.
Harry: I...I thought you just w-wanted to see my mother's eyes before you died.
Severus: Let's...let's go up to my apartment. I can....I'll set the elves to cleaning up for the night, and...okay?
Harry: If you'll follow me up?
Winky: Master Harry should remember that Winky is off tomorrow. Winky can be here, if Master needs.
Harry: I remember, Winky. It's okay. Take the day, as usual.
Severus: It's alright.
Harry: I'm happy you're alive, Professor Snape.
Severus: You may call me Severus.
Harry: Only if you call me Harry.
Severus: Alright....Harry."
12,6586855,Severus,Harry,"Severus: When did you learn to bake?
Harry: I...learned growing up. With my aunt and uncle. But...I'm self-taught. I haven't had classes or anything. A lot of experiments, a lot of baking, and a hobby of watching muggles bake on television -- when I could.
Severus: Why did you decide to open a bakery in Belfast?
Harry: I wanted somewhere close to Britain, something with a rich history, that was still governed by the UK. Uh, and I'd been here once before, on holiday during Eighth Year -- with Luna. I liked it. I liked the cafe around the corner.
Severus: And your business...it's doing well?
Harry: It's going very well. I love it, and the people here seem to love it too.
Harry: I'm going to make tea. It's almond, is that okay?
Severus: That sounds nice, thank you."
13,6586855,Severus,Harry,"Severus: I'm going to make tea. It's almond, is that okay?
Harry: That sounds nice, thank you.
Harry: I've got some sandwiches too. Uh, I'm sorry, but I don't eat dairy in my regular life...Hope that's alright.
Severus: It sounds fine, Harry.
Harry: Why are you here, Severus?
Severus: I needed to see you. To know you're alright. I wanted to make sure you're happy and well.
Harry: Did Luna tell you where to find me?
Severus: I did speak to Luna, but, no, she didn't give away your location.
Harry: I can't begin to tell you how happy I am that you're alive...But, Severus, really. How did you find me?
Severus: Minerva made me aware of your location.
Harry: Headmistress McGonagall knows where I live and work?
Severus: She visited, in her cat form, a couple of years ago...Only Luna and Minerva knew where you were, and only Minerva told me.
Harry: Good. I don't want anyone knowing where I am...I'm never going back.
Severus: I didn't come here to fetch you, Harry. You don't ever have to go back. I give you my word.
Harry: Thank you. Now. It's late, I need to be up very early to start my day and open the bakery. Was there something else you needed?
Severus: It's only half past five, it isn't late.
Harry: I get up at midnight...because I sell largely to muggles, I don't tend to use a lot of magick in my work.
Severus: Is the offer to stay the night still good?
Harry: Of course. There's a tv in your room...In the morning, you should come down to the bakery for breakfast."
14,6586855,Harry,Severus,"Harry: Is the offer to stay the night still good?
Severus: Don't worry so much about disturbing me. Thank you, for letting me stay. We have a lot to talk about, Harry.
Harry: Of course. Oh! You'll enjoy the night-blooming section, and there's a section of edible flowers as well. I'm going to catch a shower and go to sleep. I'll see you tomorrow.
Severus: *smiles at Harry's retreating back*
Severus: *thinks to himself* He hoped he'd made the right choice in choosing not to show Harry his soulmate mark. Surely Harry would have mentioned it if he'd had Severus's name somewhere on his body? The fact that he hadn't must indicate that Harry's soulmate was someone else. Either way, Severus felt it would have been really inappropriate to tell Harry. Harry had seemed really sad. Resigned, but sad. Not angry, as Severus had expected. He'd seemed weary. Like he expected at any moment for Severus to take him back to Hogwarts or something.
Severus: *heads up to the rooftop garden and tours the plants*
Severus: *goes back inside and settles in the guestroom*
Harry: *gets up at one in the morning, showers, prepares coffee for Severus, and has a cup of tea and toast*
Harry: *goes downstairs and sees Dobby and Winky working*
Dobby: Master Harry! All the breads and pies and cakes are ready to be baked, Master Harry.
Winky: Winky will be going on her day off now, unless Master needs her to stay.
Harry: That suits me fine, Winky. You've done such a good job, thank you. Enjoy your day.
Harry: *starts working on assembling pastries and scones*"
15,6586855,Dobby,Harry,"Dobby: The puff pastry is ready for you to assemble the pastries, Master Harry, and you will need to get to the scones, sir.
Harry: Dobby, thank you, for your hard work. I really appreciate it. Go on break and then run any errands. I've got this for the next couple of hours. I'll need some help when it comes to the sandwich setup, but that's not needed until about four.

Dobby: *bowed and grinned at Harry and then apparated away*

Harry: *moved one small table into the corner, with its chair having its back to the wall. He added a sash over the chair that said reserved and a little sign that said the same on the table too. He included the day's menu, a set of silverware, and a little basket full of goodies*

Severus: *sat at the table Harry had reserved for him and perused the sandwich menu*

Severus: *ordered the small tea-service, with a personal pot of Assam tea*

Severus: *took a last sip from a new pot of tea -- a vanilla blend, without any caffeine -- and looked up at Harry. He allowed his face to soften.* You, he replied.

Harry: So, he braved. You never told me why you were here. What do you need, Severus?

Severus: Just as I said, Harry. I'm not one to mince words. I came to find you because I need you. I had hoped you might need me too, Severus said, laying his cards bare.

Harry: I'm not sure what you mean, came Harry's reply. His face had paled.

Severus: Let us not belabor the point. He dragged up his sleeve,"
16,6586855,Harry,Severus,"Harry: What do you mean, you need me?
Severus: Just as I said, Harry. I'm not one to mince words. I came to find you because I need you. I had hoped you might need me too.
Harry: I'm not sure what you mean.
Severus: Let us not belabor the point.
Harry: Is this some sort of trick?
Severus: Of course not, you foolish man, I would not trick you. I would not put myself in this sort of vulnerable position for mere levity.
Harry: It's not foolish of me to be absolutely gobsmacked that I'm your bloody soulmate, Severus Snape!
Severus: No, I suppose it's not. But do leave off the dramatics. If my name is not written somewhere on your body, then that's acceptable. I'll go and leave you in peace. I will not bother you any further.
Harry: Oh, Severus, of course it is! Don't be a prat. It's been there, on my leg, since before you died nearly in my arms. I...I don't....I've wanted...
Severus: Well, then. Seems like there's only one real solution to this problem.
Harry: What now?
Severus: We get to know each other as we are now. And we make it right."
17,6586855,Harry,Griffin,"Harry: So the poh-leese are chasin' after the crimnals.
Harry: Well, your father will be home soon, my little love, so you'd better clean that up and come with me to help me set the table.
Griffin: Is Brody and Maris coming?
Harry: No, Griff, not tonight. We're having a special night at the bakery, so Brody and Maris are both working. But, they'll probably come over for lunch on Sunday.
Griffin: Can we have the blue?
Harry: Of course we can have the blue. We can always have the blue, if you want it, my little man.
Severus: Griffin Elon Snape, what are you up to?
Griffin: Helpin' Daddy set the table!
Severus: And how are you and our daughter doing on this fine Thursday evening?
Harry: A little tired. Very hungry. We're all exceedingly glad you made it home for dinner.
Severus: The castle is extremely busy right now, and Minerva has turned more and more duties over to me. I'm here as much as I can, love.
Harry: I know, Severus. It's genuine delight, not a dig, I promise.
Harry: Good. We had a really good day, Sev. All of us.
Harry: Mmmm. That feels nice.
Severus: This is always where I want to be.
Harry: Yeah?"
