0,6725662,Peter Parker,Tony Stark,"Peter Parker: Hey, Mr. Stark, can I talk to you for a second?
Tony Stark: *looks up from his work* Sure, kid. What's up?
Peter Parker: Well, um, I was just thinking...since I'm not old enough to fly unaccompanied, maybe one of the other Avengers could take me home after the fight?
Tony Stark: *raises an eyebrow* You want someone else to take you home?
Peter Parker: Yeah, I mean, it's just a suggestion. I don't want to be a burden or anything.
Tony Stark: *smirks* Kid, you're not a burden. But I think I'll take you up on that suggestion. I could use a break from all the paperwork.
Peter Parker: *grins* Thanks, Mr. Stark. I appreciate it.
Tony Stark: No problem, kid. Just don't forget to pack your suit."
1,6725662,Captain America,Peter,"Captain America: Weâ€™re not going to start fighting again, are we? Because sure, yeah, Iâ€™m ready to go again, but some of you guys look old and I donâ€™t want to accidentally break some hipsâ€”
Peter: You are not ready to go again.
Peter: I am. Did you see me take down a guy that was the size of a building? A building! Also, hey, Iâ€™m super impressed about the turning-into-a-building thing. Doesnâ€™t that break all kinds of rules about the conservation of mass? How does that even work? Is it a superpower, or are you an alien like that Thor guy, or is it, like, scienceâ€”
Hawkeye: Where did you find this kid?
Falcon: Man, even I know not to hire people off of craigslist.
Peter: Thatâ€™s rude. Who knew, other superheroes were rude. I thought that was just me.
Captain America: Weâ€™re all assholes."
2,6725662,Peter,Mr. Stark,"Peter: That's rude. Who knew, other superheroes were rude. I thought that was just me.
Mr. Stark: Nope, you're not special, pumpkin. We're all assholes.
Peter: *shuffled closer to Mr. Stark*
Peter: *sat with his legs tucked, criss-cross, hands on his knees*
Peter: SHIELD will be here soon.
Mr. Stark: *murmured to War Machine*
Rhodes: *whispered back to Mr. Stark*
Peter: Um, are we going back to New York, or...?
Tony: *began to speak*
Peter: *leapt up*
Peter: Ohhhh no. No, no, no. I'm sorry, Mr. Stark, but you promised you'd have me back.
Rhodes: *teased with a tired smile*
Peter: *flapped his hands in the air*
Hawkeye: *murmured from his place several feet away*
Scarlett Witch: *said loudly from her place in Vision's arms*
Peter: I have a Spanish test tomorrow.
Rhodes: *told Mr. Stark flatly*
Mr. Stark: *shrugged, defensive*
Peter: Guys, c'mon!
Peter: *looked around at the group of superheroes*
Peter: *kicked Building Guy in the thigh*
Building Guy: *grumbled, only half conscious*
Peter: *cast his eyes around at the other superheroes, searching*"
3,6725662,Peter,Mr. Stark,"Peter: You can turn into a giant, but can you fly? Could you fly me home? Hello?
Building Guy: No flying.
Peter: Hey, can one of you guys—
Black Widow: Not it.
Hawkeye: Not it.
Building Guy: Not it.
Mr. Stark: Oh, come on, really? Are we doing this? Really? How old are we?
Rhodes: Not it.
Scarlett Witch: Not it.
Vision: Not it, either.
Mr. Stark: Fine. Fine. Peter turned hopefully towards him, only for the billionaire to rise to his feet and say loudly, 'Not it.'
Peter: You were the one that took me here, *stabbing the man in the chest plate with a finger. It dented a little under his annoyed, desperate strength. He quickly withdraw his hand, guilty, embarrassed, but Mr. Stark only looked down at it, impressed.*
Falcon: Can't you give the kid a plane ticket?
Mr. Stark: Not without a crap-load of paperwork. Kid doesn't even have a passport. And I'm pretty sure minors aren't supposed to be flying without an adult to hold their hand, or something? Don't you have to book a special ticket or whatever if a toddler wants to fly in an aeroplane?
Peter: Why did I let you talk me into this?
Scarlett Witch: *wincing, teeth gritted at her injuries.*
Vision: *adjusting his hold on the woman and, with a shine of yellow rock and the dramatic billowing of his cape, ascending vertically into the air, flying away from them with ease.*
Peter: Oh, yeah. That's why.
Peter: Hey, he could've taken me, too.
Falcon: Wait, shit. I'm not it.
Mr. Stark: Nope. You were the last person. Hope those wings of yours don't melt over seawater, Wilson.
Peter: Weren't you guys about to tear each other to pieces, like, half an hour ago?
Falcon: He's your pet project.
Mr. Stark: How dare you. I have more than one pet project.
Peter: I am right here. And why do I suddenly feel like I've been cheated on, Mr. Stark, what the hell—
Mr. Stark: Don't you have private jets—
Peter: Not one that I can send a teenager on pilotless. Not in Germany, anyway.
Falcon: So fly home with him! I'm supposed to take the kid home so you can go after Steve? No way, Tin Man—
Mr. Stark: That is so cold of you. Look at him! Look at"
4,6725662,Tony,Sam,"Tony: Don’t you have private jets—
Sam: Not one that I can send a teenager on pilotless. Not in Germany, anyway.
Tony: So fly home with him! I’m supposed to take the kid home so you can go after Steve? No way, Tin Man—
Tony: That is so cold of you. Look at him! Look at that face! *Mr. Stark grabbed hold of Peter’s chin and tilted it gently toward Falcon, so the other man could see how sad and adorable Peter theoretically was, even though he was wearing a thick, opaque mask.*
Peter: *knocked the gauntlet away and grabbed Mr. Stark’s armoured shoulders.* Take me home, Mr. Stark!
Tony: You want me to violate the rules of ‘not it?’ How could you ask for such a thing—
Peter: *pressed his hands over his face.* Ughhhhhhhhhhh!
Black Panther: I will make sure the child is escorted home.
Peter: Thank you. *To Mr. Stark, he said,* He’s my new favourite superhero.
Tony: Hey—
Sam: This is what you get.
Black Panther: I will fight you again, Wilson—
Black Panther: Come along. *gesturing Peter forward.* Are you injured?
Peter: A little concussed. A lot bruised. *Peter shrugged.* I heal quickly.
Black Panther: If you feel as though you need assistance, I can have someone look you over. *he said.* Someone I trust. Your secret identity will not be compromised under my protection.
Peter: We just met.
Black Panther: We fought together. *Black Panther dismissed.* And you’re young. And you need assistance I can provide. I can help you, so it’s my responsibility to do so.
Peter: Yeah, *Peter said,* you’re definitely my new favourite hero."
