0,7134677,Waver,Iskander,"Waver: ...boy?
Iskander: My king...you really did grow 30 centimeters! Though I wonder why I'm back in the modern era - there isn't another war, is there? And get up off your knees, you're being way too formal.
Waver: No wars. You wished to live in the modern era, correct?
Iskander: So you missed me, huh?
Waver: Of course I missed you! Yes, I missed you. Though...I didn't expect you to be little when I summoned you again.
Iskander: Are you disappointed, boy?
Waver: No, not at all. I'd never be disappointed in you.
Iskander: You've gotten sappy, boy.
Waver: I'm not sappy, I'm old. Come on, I'll show you into the rest of my home. No need to linger in the workshop."
1,7134677,Waver,Iskander,"Waver: I want to talk to you, *his knees were complaining at being bent for too long, just another perk of getting older.*
Waver: Come on, I’ll show you into the rest of my home. No need to linger in the workshop.
Waver: …you’ve certainly improved your standing some, I’m proud of you.
Waver: *He couldn’t help the smile that was plastered to his face, Iskander was proud, Iskander was in this era – and for good this time! Today was a good day.*
Waver: *He led his diminutive king into his home, pausing only to remove his shoes and hang up the red jacket that he’d been wearing.*
Waver: *He found himself absently wondering if Iskander had noticed that he’d been wearing his colors.*
Waver: *He plopped down on the sofa and motioned for Iskander to join him.*
Waver: *There were a few moments of silence – not awkward in the least, though. Just companionable. Even after a decade of being apart, they were still able to just sit and enjoy each other’s company. It was like no time had passed whatsoever in that respect. Waver was glad of it.*
Iskander: You’re going to have to tell me all about your adventures, Waver.
Waver: *His eyes were wide and he could feel heat creeping up his cheeks, a telltale sign that he was actually blushing.*
Waver: *He looked down, fidgeting with the cuffs of his shirt for a moment.*
Waver: Of course. I did go on many…all over the world, really.
Waver: *Even though he’d been focused on his quest, Waver had made sure to enjoy each area he went to. It just seemed right. After all, it was Iskander who had inspired him to travel and somehow he thought all business and no play was a poor way to honor his king’s wishes.*
Iskander: The ritual supplied me with some information about this era…do you have, uh, pictures? Of your travels? I’d like to see. And then I want to see them in person.
Waver: *He was already starting to formulate ideas on how to get Iskander places – it was going to be more difficult with the other looking like he was about thirteen. He supposed he could just say he was a young looking adult, and that wasn’t even factoring the whole ‘getting an ID and birth certificate’ thing. It was going to be a lot of work, but Waver felt it was worth it, well worth it.*
Waver: I do have pictures, plenty of them. I can’t promise that I’m the best photographer out there –
Iskander: I don’t expect you to be the best, I expect you to be you.
Waver: *The smile returned to his face as he made eye contact with his king. Olive green met crimson.*
Waver: I think I can handle that.
Iskander: *There was another hearty chuckle as Iskander slung an arm around Waver’s shoulders, the smaller man having to reach up quite a lot to manage it.* Well, I’d hope so. Who else would be you?"

Iskander: *slung an arm around Waver’s shoulders* Well, I’d hope so. Who else would be you?
Waver: I don’t know, my mystic code? I’m going to have to get used to you being so short, Iskander.
Iskander: Well, I didn’t exactly expect you to actually grow 30 cm, boy."
