0,7249360,Draco,Harry,"Draco: That is not a scarf.
Harry: No, he's not a scarf. *Harry unzips his jacket and cradles the ball of fuzz in his hands.*
Draco: How did he end up in your jacket?
Harry: He was all on his own. He'd been left behind by somebody... He's very nervous, but he liked me, for some reason, so.
Draco: For some reason.
Harry: And it's cold out there.
Draco: I should have known... That shacking up with you meant one day you'd turn up with a sad lonely animal.
Harry: You say that like it's a bad thing.
Draco: Of course it's not a bad thing, you idiot. Have you taken it to a healer yet?
Harry: No.
Draco: Well, let's get going then. *Draco strides out of the kitchen to find his own jacket.*
Harry: *Harry pulls Draco in for a kiss, almost receiving a scratch to the face.*"

Harry: *pulls Draco in for a kiss*
Draco: He has been mine for much longer, animal, and if you’re staying you better keep that in mind.
Harry: *snorts*
Draco: You’re buying me dinner while we’re out.
Harry: Am I?
Draco: I was talking to the cat.

Draco: The Earl of nothing. Just Earl.
Harry: The Earl of Nothing, a just noble.
Draco: *throws a pillow at Harry*
Harry: *gets scratched by the cat*
Draco: *ends up with a kitten called The Earl who is trying to steal his boyfriend*

Hermione: He’s so sweet!
Ron: He’s cute.
Draco: *agrees that the kitten is cute*
Draco: He agrees with me about the Internet.
Draco: *yelling at the kitten across the bed*
Draco: He agrees with me about the Internet.
Draco: *feels soppy towards the kitten*
Draco: It’s not a disagreement, don’t worry.
Draco: *gets swiped or bitten by the kitten*
Draco: I am much cuter than that stupid cat.
Hermione: You love him.
Draco: *raises an eyebrow*
Hermione: The cat. We’ve"
2,7249360,Ron,Draco,"Ron: Draco, I think you've got competition.
Draco: I am much cuter than that stupid cat.
Hermione: You love him. I can see it.
Draco: Must we continue to say these things out loud?
Hermione: Yes, we must. It's good for you.

Draco: If Harry was here he wouldn't have time for any of us. He probably wouldn't let me touch him, either.
Sadie: Wouldn't let you touch him, the cat, or wouldn't let you touch Harry?
Draco: Either. A cat is coming between us.
Teresa: Is that a real thing or a Draco thing?
Draco: So it's a Draco thing.
Sadie: Just wait 'til next Valentine's Day and see who he gives chocolates to.
Draco: Yes, thank you, I'll wait a year and find out then.
Abigail: Well, I think if he gave them to the cat it'd be an even more dramatic statement in Draco's favor, wouldn't it?
Draco: We can look for the answer on the Internet!
Sadie: Okay, sweetheart.

Harry: Aren't you meant to always be approachable at the reference desk?
Draco: I am extremely approachable. However, I must also do a lot of work, without the aid of a computer, because the wizarding world is extremely primitive and prejudiced.
Harry: He's fine.
Draco: Says you!
Harry: He was just so sad to see me go."
3,7249360,Draco,Harry,"Draco: You’re more pitiful than he is. What do you want?
Harry: To steal you away for lunch. For old time’s sake.
Draco: And at what establishment are we meant to eat with a kitten in your jacket?
Harry: The great outdoors.
Draco: Are we foraging?
Harry: You’re in top form today. I reckoned we’d get something to-go, you massive arsehole.
Maude: This is a public establishment at which there are children, young man.
Draco: I was just telling him to get it out of here.
Maude: What sort of librarian are you?
Draco: You can try, but he only likes Harry, because they’re both horrible.
Maude: You’re Draco’s boy!
Harry: Er — that’s me.
Maude: And this is Draco’s boy, as well.
Harry: I’ll get him out of here. I was just coming round to steal Draco for lunch.
Maude: Oh, I suppose you’d better, before Audrey sees.
Harry: Is that what I’m known for here?
Draco: Being a madman carting around cats?
Harry: As Draco’s boy.
Draco: Yes, I’m a lot more famous than you, comparatively. In the land of magical libraries.
Harry: The most famous student reference desk employee they’ve got, I imagine.
Draco: What, your fame?
Harry: I’m extremely famous. I meant — that you’re my boy.
Draco: I think you’re The Earl’s boy now.
Harry: Yes, laugh it up."
4,7249360,Draco,Harry,"Draco: No, I think you're The Earl's boy now.
Harry: *laughs loudly* Yes, laugh it up. It's hilarious that you've left me for a kitten.
Draco: *still laughing* Wait. You're not serious?
Harry: You're a little bit serious, aren't you?
Draco: Of course not.
Harry: You know I'm not dating The Earl, right?
Draco: Surely you know I'm not into animals.
Harry: Potter.
Harry: *stares at Draco* You're right. You're absolutely right. All this time what I've been doing is planning to propose to The Earl.
Draco: *goggles at Harry* What?
Harry: Draco, I was joking. I mean, obviously, but I mean, entirely. There's no... you're jealous of our cat?
Draco: I don't feel like eating with you anymore.
Harry: *grabs Draco's arm* Draco, you're being weird.
Draco: I appreciate the insult.
Harry: I don't like the cat more than you.
Draco: Well, the cat likes you more than he likes me.
Harry: I don't know about that.
Draco: I do.
Harry: I'm very likable.
Draco: I don't like you at all.
Harry: That's why little old lady librarians refer to me as 'Draco's boy,' right?
Draco: Yes, Draco's boy as in, the one he hates and complains about all the time.
Harry: Funny how fine that line is.
Draco: *glaring*
Harry: *smiles at Draco*
Draco: How about you let me kiss you?
Draco: Will The Earl allow it?
Harry: *looks down at The Earl* He'll allow it.
Draco: *looks at The Earl* He's not your boy.
Harry: *laughs*"
