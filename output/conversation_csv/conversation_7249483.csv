0,7249483,Hermione Jean Granger,George Weasley,"Fred: Hermione Jean Granger, what keeps you out of your bed at this late hour?
Hermione: I was just about to ask you the same question. This wouldn’t happen to be a meeting pertaining to the illegal testing of unsafe products on minors, would it?
George: Illegal? Unsafe? Now that just doesn’t sound like us at all.
Hermione: George, you’re not theoretically putting those kids in danger-
Fred: It’s not like they’ll die, ‘Mione, we have made sure they’re not poison.
Hermione: And what if it kills you?
Fred: Aw, Hermione, we never knew you cared for us so much!
George: Though we all know you care for one of us in particular.
Hermione: And what’s that supposed to mean?
George: Oh, nothing, just that I’m pretty sure you’re madly in love with me.
Hermione: I wouldn’t touch you with a barge pole, George Weasley - you are nothing but trouble.
George: *leans in close to Hermione* Yet you’re holding his hand…"
1,7249483,Hermione Granger,Fred Weasley,"Hermione Granger: “It’s mad that if you’d put half the work and effort you’ve put into the shop into your studies you’d have done wonderfully -” she ignored his scoff, “-and it’s insane that you’ve been thinking about this since you were twelve - ridiculous, even - but you’re not dreaming kids any more, Fred. You’ve put in the galleons, yes, but it’s more than that. You’ve set a goal and you’re working towards it with everything you’ve got. I know how much market research you do and I know how thoroughly you’ve been studying the theory behind your products. I’m sorry to ruin your self image but you two have been downright studious, and you need to start taking responsibility for that. You are far more intelligent than you let on to anybody and, to be honest, it kind of scares me how brilliant I think this whole thing is.”
Fred Weasley: *stares silently at her*
Hermione Granger: *blushes* “That’s not to say there are no problems with the enterprise. The experimentation on first years, for example,” she hit him with a glare, but he looked so disarmed that she couldn’t quite hold it, “is unacceptable. If you want to be a reputable company you have to start acting like one, Fred Weasley. And that means finding a place better than your dorms to work out formulae and recipes too. I’m surprised that boys of your caliber haven’t figured out how to sneak into the potions labs after hours yet-”
Fred Weasley: “Hermione Granger!” *exclaims* “are you suggesting that we do something… against the school rules?”
Hermione Granger: *inhales sharply* “If it means you have higher quality products less likely to kill anyone,” she admitted, “then yes. If you’re serious about this… If this isn’t just another game to you, then… well. If there’s one thing we’re all learning from this year, it’s that some risks are worth taking.”
Fred Weasley: *studies her for a moment* “Yeah, okay - I take your point, but this is hardly the same as the DA is it? It’s just a joke shop.”
Hermione Granger: *laughs incredulously* “Just a joke shop? Are you a Weasley twin or not?” She paused. “Now more than ever we need laughter, we need some stupid jokes, we need happiness and light.” Quietly, she added: “We need you.”
Fred Weasley: *grins at her*
Hermione Granger: “Yes, well don’t get used to it,” she said, but there was no edge to her voice, and Fred grinned at her. After another moment of silence she added, “if you need any help with anything…” She trailed off and he stared at her curiously for a second before nodding.
Fred Weasley: “Thanks, ‘Mione.”
Hermione Granger: “Don’t mention it.”
Fred Weasley: “Wouldn’t dream of it,” He assured her, and watched her rise from the chair and head towards the girls’ dorms. Something in him ached to see her walk away and he called her name again on instinct, causing her to turn to him with one eyebrow arched.
Fred Weasley: “Really, Hermione,” he said softly, “thanks.”"
2,7249483,Hermione,George,"Hermione: The straight and narrow. Right. A path you haven’t even been in owling distance of since you were about five.
George: We’re deeply offended.
Fred: Alright then, what are you two doing here?
Fred: Just taking your advice, ‘Mione.
Fred: Harry lent us his cloak.
Hermione: What are you doing?
Fred: Please tell me you’ve not been slaving away over that cauldron on that.
Hermione: Why? I’m perfectly capable of NEWT level work, Fred-
Fred: I would never dare suggest otherwise, but it might interest you to know that this edition of the book has got several typos-
Hermione: -probably because they hired a half troll to do the editing-
Fred: -and as a result, this recipe is incorrect.
Fred: I think Snape said that’s supposed to be eight times anti clockwise and one time clockwise.
Fred: Believe me yet?
Hermione: I don’t have any problem believing you, Fred.
George: Our condolences.
Fred: At least you know it wasn’t your fault, you’re not the stupid one.
George: Well, as much as we enjoy your potion-related crises, Hermione, we’ve got a couple of our own we need to sort out, so…"
3,7249483,Ron,Hermione,"Ron: “Yeah but one minute she’s telling them off and the next she’s best bum chums with them,” He paled. “You don’t think they’ve slipped anything into her morning Pumpkin juice or something, do you? Made her like them or whatever? Oh my God, I think they were working on a love potion in the holidays-”
Harry: “Ron,” Harry stopped him before his ramblings got even more out of hand, “I don’t think she’s in love with them. I think she’s enjoying working with them. And anyway, they stopped testing on the first years, didn’t they? That was her main problem.”
Ron: “They’re her main problem, if you ask me,” grumbled Ron, but he let it go. “We should probably get ready to leave - Quidditch in ten.”
***
Ron: “What have you done to Hermione?” He asked, glaring at George, who raised an eyebrow.
George: “What are you on about?”
Ron: “Her-mi-o-ne,” said Ron, like he was talking to a child, “you’ve done something to her to make her help you, and you need to stop it.” He heard a laugh from behind him and turned to Fred.
Fred: “Did it ever occur to you that she might just enjoy spending time with us?” He asked, throwing the snitch over Ron’s head to neatly land in George’s open palm. Ron gave a humorless laugh.
Ron: “Hermione? With you?” He asked, voice hard, “have you met her?”
Fred: “Yeah, Ron, I have actually - and we happen to work well together, so with all due respect - which stands at zero, by the way - you can kindly fuck off and keep your abnormally long nose out of our business.”
***
Fred: *angry* “Yeah, Ron, I have actually - and we happen to work well together, so with all due respect - which stands at zero, by the way - you can kindly fuck off and keep your abnormally long nose out of our business.”"
4,7249483,Fred,Ferret,"Fred: Oi, Ferret! I suggest that you look up the word revolting before you use it like that again - or better yet, look in a mirror. That should give you a pretty good idea as to what the word actually means.
Malfoy: What? You’re telling me she’s got the whole Weasley clan defending her? I’d say she were well connected for a mudblood but-
Fred: And as for that word, if I ever hear even a syllable of that fucking word leaving your nasty little rodent mouth again, I’ll beat you so hard even Madame Pomfrey won’t be able to fix you up.
Hermione: Thanks."
5,7249483,Hermione,Fred,"Hermione: Thanks, but you know I could have handled that, right? *moving forward to try to see his face*
Fred: *clenched his jaw, not meeting her eyes* You shouldn't have to.
Hermione: *half laughed* Aw, Fred, I never knew you cared for me so much!
Fred: *looked as though he was going to be sick* Fred?
Hermione: Are you okay?
Fred: *almost laughed* No. No, I'm not okay. I'd better head inside. *walked away*"
6,7249483,Hermione,Ron,"Hermione: Well you did just suggest that the only way I would ever spend time with him is if I was being enchanted into it.
Ron: Yeah, well, I still don’t really understand-
Hermione: I like him, Ron, and I like working with him.
Ron: She didn’t mean- like, like?
Harry: *opens his mouth to dismiss the idea as ridiculous but stops halfway through*
Ron: She didn’t mean- like, like?
Harry: *opens his mouth to dismiss the idea as ridiculous but stops halfway through*
Hermione: The thing is, I think he..."
7,7249483,Hermione,Ron,"Hermione: Well, at least you asked my opinion before assuming what I was or wasn’t capable of feeling. Ron shouldn’t have confronted you without talking to me first - I could have explained about our work. *sighs* Fred- The thing is, I think he’s feeling jealous.
Fred: *mouth opened slightly, staring at her*
Hermione: I mean, last year - with Krum - *blushing furiously* - he spent so much time being aggressive towards him that I sort of figured that he must, at least on some level, like me.
Fred: *trying to keep his face calm and inviting*
Hermione: But I waited for him to make a move and he never did - and I realised I didn’t really want him to. I asked Harry to talk to him about calming down then but I don’t think he even realises he’s doing the same thing again.
Fred: *trying to understand what she’d just said*
Fred: You didn’t want Ron to make a move?
Hermione: Of course not, he’s one of my best friends. *pauses* I did think, once… but not any more.
Fred: *staring dumbly at her*
Fred: You… don’t like Ron?
Hermione: No…? I mean of course I like him - he’s my friend, I’m not insulting your brother or anything but-
Fred: *laughing hysterically*
Hermione: Fred?
Fred: *waves her concern away with a freckled hand*
Fred: I just realized I’m as much of an idiot as my brother.
Hermione: *half-smiling half-bemused expression*
Fred: It’s like you said, right? About assuming what you’re feeling. I’ve just been taking it as a given for so long that you and Ron…
Hermione: *frowning*
Fred: *gazing at her rapturously*
Fred: Is that… is that relevant?
Hermione: *eyes widening incrementally, mouth opening in a silent oh*
Fred: *smiling besottedly at her*
Fred: Do you want it to be?
Hermione: *blushing*
Fred: Listen, it doesn’t have to be. Relevant, I mean. I mean, I’ve gone this long without acknowledging it, I can go on for a bit longer… We can just pretend today never happened, and go back to working on Wheezes as friends, yeah? You don’t have to-"
8,7249483,Fred,Hermione,"Fred: Listen, it doesn't have to be relevant. I mean, I've gone this long without acknowledging it, I can go on for a bit longer... We can just pretend today never happened, and go back to working on Wheezes as friends, yeah? You don't have to worry about hurting my precious feelings or whatever-
Fred: ...Or?
Hermione: Or... I try to stifle my squeals of joy, which will otherwise soon be turned into cries of pain by one Madam Prince- released as I am from the chains of my previous noble intentions. I kiss you stupid on this library sofa and then we hold hands all the way back to the common room like - like Percy and Penelope bloody Clearwater - making stupid goo-goo eyes at each other until we lose every one of our friends due to our disgusting behaviour and end up living the rest of our lives as hermits in a cave somewhere in the south of France where we can steal food from a nearby vineyard. Or whatever else you want to do, I'm easy.
Hermione: Well, that kissing me stupid part did sound pretty interesting. Although I warn you, with my intelligence levels, it might take a while to get all the way down to stupid-
Fred: I've been told I'm a very goal-driven man, Granger, I think I might be willing to put in the time-

BANG!
Hermione: You know, when books mentioned fireworks I didn't think they were being literal, Fred.
Fred: Must have forgotten it was in my pocket-
Madam Prince: FIREWORKS! IN MY LIBRARY!

Fred: Look sharp, Granger-
Hermione: Right behind you, Weasley-"
