0,745690,Charles,Hank,"Charles: Pepperoni. Also, sausage. No to peppers, yes to olives, and a thick crust please. *corrects one of Hank's equations*
Charles: Thank you. Bye. I love you.
Charles: Umm...
Charles: Oh, of course not. Although that's rather cheap of you. Charging your lover full-price.
Charles: Not that—not that I'm your lover. Sorry, that was a mistake. I wouldn't ever tell you I love you. Wait, that's not what I meant—Not that you aren't loveable, of course! I'm sure your mother loves you very much, and you've probably got wonderful friends who adore you. And I like you, not saying I didn't, naturally, you've been very polite and—and I'm going to shut up now. Goodbye.
Charles: *slams the receiver down into the cradle*
Charles: *takes a moment to be stupidly relieved that no one's in his office at the moment to witness the furious flush that's suffusing his face*
Charles: Smooth, Charles. Really. This is why multitasking is going to ruin him one day.
Charles: *puts the incident out of his mind*
Delivery man: *knocks on his door and hands his pizza over*
Charles: *pays him quickly and takes the box back to his desk*
Charles: *flips the box open and is startled to see a note written on the inside of the top flap*"
1,745690,Charles,Erik,"Charles: Hey, this is sort of cheesy, but you are one supreme slice. Love, the guy you confessed your undying love to. P.S. You sound adorable when you’re flustered.
Charles: Erm, I’m terribly sorry about that, I didn’t mean—
Employee: Nah, it’s cool! Erik, get your ass over here!
Charles: *ends the call before the employee on the other end can say anything more*
Charles: Hey, British dude! Writing you a message while Erik’s in the back. He’d kill me if he saw me doing this. Anyway, your voice is sexy. Call me?
Charles: The first man though…Erik. His voice had been deep and mature and had been shot through with an accent that Charles hadn’t been able to readily identify. Now that had been a sexy voice.
Erik: *picks up the phone*"
2,745690,Erik,Charles,"Erik: Frost's Pizzas, how can I help you? *his voice taking on an impatient edge*
Charles: Oh! Uh…hi. I’d like to order a pizza. One small, with pepperoni, sausage—
Erik: —no peppers, olives, and a thick crust, *finishes swiftly* Got it.
Charles: *gapes at the phone* How did you…
Erik: Charles. It’s Charles, right?
Charles: *realizes Erik knows his name* You remember me?
Erik: You’re the only guy who ever calls who has a British accent, *a bit of amusement creeping into his tone* Kind of hard to miss.
Charles: *laughs* Yes. Sorry about that.
Erik: As long as it doesn’t happen again, *says easily* Your total’s going to be $12.60. It should be there in half an hour.
Charles: All right. Thank you.
Erik: What? No goodbye?
Charles: *blushes* Thank you. Bye.
Erik: *waits expectantly* Love you.
Charles: *confused* Hah.
Erik: There it is. I just wanted to hear it so I could reclaim your love from Sean.
Charles: *laughs* Bye then.
Erik: *laughs* You’ll have to work for that, *hangs up*"
3,745690,Charles,Erik,"Charles: Hello, I’d like to order a small pizza for delivery to—
Employee: Erik! Lover Boy!
Charles: *heart skips a few beats* Hello? Um, hi. It’s me. Charles.
Erik: Yeah, I got that from ‘Lover Boy.’
Charles: Is that what they call me? Could I petition for a more dignified moniker?
Erik: Depends. What did you have in mind?
Charles: I don’t know. Just something that doesn’t sound as if I’m a lovesick teenager.
Erik: Are you?
Charles: What? A teenager.
Erik: No. Just checking though. Will it be the usual?
Charles: Yes please.
Erik: All right. Your total’s $12.60. Should be there in thirty minutes.
Charles: Excellent.
Charles: Oh. Last time Sean wrote me a message asking—
Erik: —asking you to call him?
Charles: Yeah, he told me. Don’t worry about it. The kid’s going through a phase where he assumes every man he speaks to is gay and available…
Erik: *voice faintly hopeful* I am.
Charles: *breathless* ...Oh.
Erik: Which one?
Charles: Both.
Erik: Oh. All right.
Charles: All right.
Charles: Call again next week?
Erik: Yes. Same time.
Charles: Good. I’m looking forward to it.
Erik: Yes. Me too."
4,745690,Charles,Erik,"Charles: It’s probably better if he didn’t get his hopes up. Erik could be hideous. He could be completely not Charles’s type. He could be a mutantphobe, for all Charles knows. He refuses to allow himself to get hung up on this guy. He’ll just take it one week at a time. One week. Why the hell does one Wednesday have to be seven days after the next?

Angel: “Hello, Frost’s Pizzas. This is Angel. How may I help you?”
Charles: Angel. Hi. Is Erik there?
Angel: “No, he’s in the office. Can I take a message?”
Charles: No. Actually, yes. This is Charles. Charles Xavier?
Angel: “Oh! Lover B—Professor X!”
Charles: What?
Angel: “Erik told us to think of a new nickname for you. Since you’re a professor, we thought Professor X would work.”
Charles: Professor X. It’s better than Lover Boy at least.
Angel: “So, like, are you old?”
Charles: Pardon me?
Angel: “You don’t sound too old, but you’re a professor. I’m picturing you as my grandfather in tweed.”
Charles: Well— I am wearing tweed, but I’m not anywhere near old enough to be anyone’s grandfather. I’m only twenty-eight.
Angel: “Wow. Genius, huh? Erik will be happy to hear that. The not-old part more than the genius part. Though the genius part is cool, too.”
Charles: Is Erik…um, is he…
Angel: “Thirty, hot as hell, and single. He’s working part-time here ’cause he’s in between jobs. No messy exes that I know of. He’s not allergic to anything, he cleans up after himself, and he’s a pretty cool guy once you get past his smile.”
Charles: What? What’s wrong with his smile?
Angel: “Picture that great white on Shark Week and give it hair. Trust me, it takes some getting used to.”
Charles: Wait, wait, how can you know that?
Angel: “He talks about you. Like, a lot. Well, a lot by Erik standards. He barely says three sentences to anyone all day, and you take up two.”
Charles: Anyway, we’re rooting for you. Erik’s probably the most antisocial guy we’ve ever met. It’d be nice for him to have someone to distract him from bitching at us.
Charles: I’ll tell him you called. Anything else? Did you want a pizza?"
5,745690,Angel,Erik,"Angel: “Erik’s probably the most antisocial guy we’ve ever met. He’s not a bad guy, but he doesn’t go out much. It’d be nice for him to have someone to distract him from bitching at us.”
Charles: “Ah…okay?”
Angel: “I’ll tell him you called. Anything else? Did you want a pizza?”
Charles: “Yes please.”
Angel: *gives Charles his usual order* “He’s usually around the phone during his shifts. You’ll probably catch him.”
Charles: “All right. Thank you.”
Angel: “No problem, Prof.” *smiles* “Pizza’ll be there before one.”

Charles: *tries to wait until next Wednesday to call* “Hello, Frost’s Pizzas.”
Erik: “Charles! I wasn’t expecting—You always call on Wednesdays.”
Charles: *grins* “Decided to change it up. I hope you don’t mind.”
Erik: “No, I don’t.”
Charles: “I’m not distracting you from work?”
Erik: “Business is slow right now. And if you’re ordering something, this is work.”
Charles: “Oh. Right. Then I’ll have a small pepperoni pizza. I heard…Well, I spoke to Angel the other day.”
Erik: “She told me.” *pauses* “She can get a little…overenthusiastic sometimes. So if she said anything, it’s best to take it with a grain of salt. Toppings?”
Charles: *heart sinks a little* “I’ll have sausage, no peppers, and olives.”
Erik: “I thought you said you decided to change it up,” *teasingly* “Fine. Give me onions and extra cheese. And breadsticks.”
Charles: “Got it. Your total is $18.28. It’ll be there in half an hour. You know the drill.”
Erik: “I do.”
Charles: *after a moment* “So you’re a professor.”
Erik: “Genetics.” *guarded tone* “You’re interested in that? Evolution?”
Charles: “Among other things.”
Erik: *sounds abruptly guarded* “You’re interested in that? Evolution?”
Charles: “Among other things.”
Erik: *light tone but with a layer of steel underneath* “Listen, if you’ve got anything against mutants, we should stop talking. I’m a metallokinetic. That means I—”
Charles: *delight coursing through him* “You can move metal.”"
6,745690,Erik,Charles,"Erik: “Listen,” he says, his tone light but there is a layer of steel underneath, “if you’ve got anything against mutants, we should stop talking. I’m a metallokinetic. That means I—”
Charles: “You can move metal,” Charles breathes, delight coursing through him. “Oh, that’s brilliant.”
Erik: “So you’re not mutantphobic?” Erik asks, relief tingeing the question.
Charles: “Not at all, my friend!” Charles laughs giddily. “You see, I’m a mutant as well. Telepath.”
Erik: “Really? That’s…that’s amazing.” And Erik actually sounds amazed. “I wasn’t sure…I was going to tell you that if you didn’t like the idea of mutants, I didn’t want to speak anymore. But you’re a mutant. This is good.”
Charles: “This is good,” Charles echoes, excitement making it difficult to keep still. His mind is spinning. What next? Is it too soon to ask to meet?
Erik: “Your pizza will be there soon. We’ll talk later.”
Charles: “Oh. Okay.” He hangs up confused. He’d thought that conversation was going somewhere. Apparently he’s worse at reading people without the benefit of his telepathy than he’d thought. But when his pizza arrives, he understands: there, written on the lid, is Erik’s name and a number. ‘Call me after six?’ is scribbled underneath. His heart leaps as he scrabbles for his cellphone and saves Erik’s number to his contacts. He stares at it for a long moment, hardly daring to believe it. He wants to call immediately. Then he glances at the clock—still six hours to go. Damn.
Charles: He accomplishes exactly nothing all afternoon. His stomach is too busy tying itself into knots for him to concentrate. It’s been months since he’s been on a proper date. Lately, he’s fallen back into his old habit of bar-hopping, and as fun as that can be, he’s been looking for something a bit more substantial. His younger sister already has a relationship that’s lasted longer than any of his own. He can’t deny that he’s a little jealous about how much Hank and Raven adore each other. He wants that. He’s always wanted that, and this is the first time he’s been willing to admit that to himself. If Erik asks him out…oh God. What the hell is he supposed to do on a date? What the hell should he wear? Not tweed—as much as he likes it, he does agree with Raven that it makes him look older and more formal than he’d like. He mentally sorts through his closet. Jeans? T-shirts? A nice button-down? At the very least, they’ll be face-to-face, which means that, with his telepathy in proper working order, Charles will be a thousand times more at ease. He worries so much that six arrives before he’s even ready. He hasn’t even thought of what to say yet. He agonizes over it for a long five minutes before deciding to just improvise. Hitting call, he holds his breath as the line rings. Barely two seconds pass before Erik picks up. “Hello?”
Charles: “Erik! It’s Charles.”
Erik: “Charles. I’m glad you called. I wasn’t sure if you would.”
Charles: Charles laughs. “How could I resist?”
Erik: “Yes, well…I wanted to ask if you’re free on Wednesday for lunch. You could come by the shop, get your pizza personally.”
Charles: Not quite a date then. Charles lets out a breath. Then Erik adds, “If you came at one, you’d catch me in my lunch break. We could…share a pizza.”
Charles: It is a date then. Charles’s heart hammers against his chest. “Yes. That sounds great. One o’clock?”
Erik: “Yes. See you here?”
Charles: “See you.” Charles hangs up and puts his phone down. Then he immediately picks it back up to text Raven."
7,745690,Charles Xavier,Erik,"Charles: If you came at one, you’d catch me in my lunch break. We could…share a pizza.
Charles: Yes. That sounds great. One o’clock?
Charles: See you.
Charles: Hello, my name is Charles Xavier. I’m here to—
Charles: Thank you for that.
Erik: Charles?
Charles: Yes. Hi. Nice to meet you, Erik.
Erik: I had Sean make up your usual. There’s a table in the back. That is, if you still want to.
Charles: I’d love to, my friend.
Erik: Come on. We can eat, and I can show you what I can do.
Charles: I can’t wait."
