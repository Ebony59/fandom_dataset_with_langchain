0,757029,Harry,Dumbledore,"Harry: Well, first things first. Best make explanations and get my visa. Wouldn’t do to be an illegal time traveller.
Harry: Now, what to do with myself? Stuck in the past, not a Knut to my name… I need a job.
Harry: He slammed open the doors of the great hall at Hogwarts, and was casting before the gathered staff and students could do more than jump in shock … or scream shrilly in the case of some of the girls and Draco Malfoy.
Harry: Expelliarmus, Stupefy, Incarcerous.
Harry: Who are you?
Dumbledore: My name is Harry Potter.
Harry: Can you prove your claim?
Harry: Expecto Patronum.
Dumbledore: If he is Harry, and I believe he is."
1,757029,Dumbledore,Harry,"Dumbledore: Can you prove your claim?
Harry: Expecto Patronum.
Dumbledore: In that case...
Dumbledore: Minerva, if you would contact the DMLE for me? Filius, Pomona, see that the students get off to class despite all this drama. Severus, if you would help me move our prisoner. And Mr Potter—
Dumbledore: The elder Mr Potter. If you would join us?
Harry: Of course.
Dumbledore: My apologies Madame Maxine, Highmaster Karkaroff, for the interruption of yours and your students’ breakfasts. Please, enjoy the remainder of it in relative peace.
Dumbledore: So, you’re from the future then my boy.
Harry: Not quite a boy anymore. But that’s about the size of it, yeah.
Snape: A Hogwarts dropout and a criminal. Why am I not surprised?
Dumbledore: If only you had been more discreet. I imagine that stunt in the great hall has affected the timeline considerably. Any foreknowledge you possess could be becoming less and less accurate by the second. If you had let things play out then—
Harry: Wouldn’t have worked. If the avatars of Fortune, Misfortune, Chaos and What-The-Fuck paired off and spawned, and then their kids got together, giving them a mutual grandchild … who was a wizard … well, that child would probably be me. By my age, I’ve pretty much resigned myself to the fact that I’m alternately destiny’s golden boy and chew toy. No way would things have just gone smoothly and as expected, even if I tried staying out of it.
Harry: Severus Snape, You are just as petty and unpleasant as I remember. I’m suddenly feeling all warm and tingly at having got to see you die.
Dumbledore: Harry, really.
Snape: How dare you, you—
Harry: I can’t believe I named my son after you.
McGonagall: How dare you, you—"
2,757029,Harry,McGonagall,"Harry: I can't believe I named my son after you.
McGonagall: *arrived with Madam Bones and Aurors Tonks and Shacklebolt in tow*
Moody: *transforming into Barty Crouch Jr*
Harry: *stood back and watched for the most part*
Fudge: Who do you think you are?
Harry: Harry Potter, from the future.
Fudge: *threatened to have him arrested for illegal time travel*
Harry: *presented his visa*
Fudge: *paled*
Madam Bones: *shot Harry an appreciative look*
Harry: *threatened to go to the Prophet with an exposé on ministry corruption*
Madam Bones: *insisted that Barty Jr be interrogated*
Snape: You named your son after me?
Harry: What!?
Dumbledore: *twinkled his eyes merrily*
McGonagall: Show yourselves at once.
Hermione: *looked torn between nervousness and desperate curiosity*
Ron: *looked a little green*
Harry: *looked at his counterpart with fear on his face*
runty-Harry: That's a joke, right?
Harry: 'Fraid not.
Snape: *stumbled from the room*
Harry: I wasn't in my right mind at the time.
runty-Harry: *looked near to tears*
Harry: Gin-Bitch Weasley had been dosing me with Amortentia since summer before sixth year.
Hermione: She didn't!
Ron: What did you call my sister?
Harry: It took two years of mind healing before my mind was quite right again.
runty-Harry: *said quietly*
Harry: And earned herself twenty in Azkaban."
3,757029,Harry,Ginny,"Harry: A potion’s different. It’s in your system. Can’t fight it off the same way. Still, my subconscious gave it a hell of a try, and it warped itself in the process. Took two years of mind healing, after the potion was discovered and flushed from my system, before my mind was quite right again.
runty-Harry: Ginny did that?
Harry: And earned herself twenty in Azkaban. Only good thing to come of our non-consensual relationship and marriage, apart from the sprogs.
Dumbledore: Well, that was another timeline. I’m sure that in this world things will be different. Nothing has happened here yet. We cannot hold against this Miss Weasley the actions of her counterpart.
Harry: Actually, her interrogation revealed that she started planning it back after her first year. So, such a thing has happened here already. Or started to.
Ron: Ginny wouldn’t—
Harry: She did. Maybe you should ask her where she got the idea, too. Or just get your mum to tell you about that time she used a love potion on your dad. That’d explain it just as well.
Hermione: That wasn’t Amortentia. Mrs Weasley’s told me the story. It wasn’t anything as insidious as a love potion really. It just caused a brief infatuation. Just enough to get him to notice her. It lasted a half hour at most. It’s not the same at all.
Harry: Alright, you have a point. And possibly it wasn’t all Ginny’s fault either. There was some suspicion that she might have been corrupted from that thing with Riddle’s diary. Combine that with her fangirl obsession and everything got out of hand. Might want to get that checked out by a mind healer actually, before any damage becomes permanent and untraceable. If it hasn’t already.
McGonagall: I’ll just—
Dumbledore: Contact Molly and Arthur. Yes, of course. Tell them the school can be expected to provide medical costs as necessary, since the incident occurred while she was under Hogwarts care.
Harry: And then there were five.
Dumbledore: I won’t ask what you three were thinking, sneaking into my office under that admirable cloak of yours, young Mr Potter. I think I can guess quite well that you were curious about our visitor. But you have classes starting very shortly that you need to attend.
runty-Harry: But sir—
Harry: I’ll be around kiddo. After all, Hogwarts has just had an opening for a Defence professor, right?
Dumbledore: An excellent idea. Run along now you three.
Harry: So..."
4,757029,Hermione,Harry,"Hermione: So you haven’t come back to avert catastrophe? Not to save those who were lost? To fight Voldemort better? Nothing at all?
Harry: Nope. Total accident. Experiment gone wrong. I thought I’d taken enough precautions but… Not even an Unspeakable is perfect.
Hermione: You were an Unspeakable? You must know all sorts of magic!
Harry: *relieved when the rest of his students arrived and classes started* Right. All of you sit down, shut up and pay attention!
Hermione: Yes, Professor… Professor Potter, she finished, as if it were the strangest thing she’d ever said. I suppose that we ought to have suspected what he was, given what he was teaching.
Harry: Don’t be stupid. The Unforgivables are a brilliant lesson. Just needed to be less about the gruesome demonstrations, and traumatizing of young minds, and more about the practicalities. Like, for example … the Killing Curse. Well? Anyone want to tell me how you’d fight that?
Hermione: *raised a tentative hand* Well, you can’t. Apart from Harry, which was a strange and still not really understood situation, there’s no known counter to the Killing Curse. No shield that’ll hold it at bay.
Harry: BZZZZZT! Wrong. There are in fact a number of defenses against the Killing Curse. And there’s definitely a sort of shield that’ll work against it. Anyone? No? A physical shield. Come on. You levitate or chuck something in the way of the curse, or duck behind something else so it takes the hit. Yeah, your ‘shield’ will probably only be good for one use, before it shatters or explodes or turns to dust, but it still works.
Hermione: *muttering* Why didn’t I think of that?
Ron: But we’re Gryffindors. Only cowards run away.
Harry: Bullshit. There’s nothing particularly brave about hanging about and getting killed, alright? Something that took me years too long to learn. Getting killed, or almost killed, when you could be doing otherwise, is not courage."
5,757029,Harry,Ron,"Harry: Run, Apparate, whatever. Avoid that fight.
Ron: But we're Gryffindors. Only cowards run away.
Harry: Bullshit. There's nothing particularly brave about hanging about and getting killed, alright? Something that took me years too long to learn. Getting killed, or almost killed, when you could be doing otherwise, is not courage. It's stupidity. Dying should only ever be a last resort.
runty-Harry: But what if it's not just you?
Harry: Alright, let's think this through. Let's say you stuck around and took that death blow. What then? What have you accomplished? You're certainly no help to them then. Well, unless they use your corpse as a shield, and watch it turn into a chunky pink mist. And then of course, they're soon as dead as you are.
runty-Harry: But at least I'd die with them, trying to help! And maybe, my dying would give them a chance to escape.
Harry: I haven't heard such a load of immature self-centred bullshit since I was an immature self-centred brat myself.
Ron: That's not fair.
Harry: Just because it isn't fair doesn't mean it isn't true. Mr Potter, let's say you did die for your friends. Mr Weasley, Miss Granger, is that what you would want? Would you want Mr Potter to die for you?
Harry: Well, no, but—
Harry: In fact, such truly loyal friends would probably prefer to have died yourselves then have Mr Potter here get killed in your place. Am I right?
Harry: Which means, Mr Potter, that your dying wasn't some noble selfless sacrifice. It's not what they want. Not what would be best for them. It's best for you. It's done to protect your feelings from the loss of your friends.
Harry: Well, it's not all doom and gloom. There's a third option besides 'die selfishly' or 'lose your friends'. I call it 'run away, but take your friends with you'. Or, you know, don't go rushing into danger in the first place. Think things through. I had a dog once. Big black thing. Loved it to bits. Then I went and got it killed by rushing into a situation, he said, giving runty-Harry a meaningful glance that made his eyes go wide with horrified understanding.
Harry: And oh, look at the time! Class dismissed. Next lesson we'll be working on your Imperius resistance. Nothing worse than being forced to rape and slaughter your loved ones, he said cheerfully, ignoring the blanched faces at his comment. I'm sure you all want to work hard to avoid that.
Hermione: But you can't Apparate in Hogwarts. It says so in 'Hogwarts, a History'!"
6,757029,Ron,Hermione,"Ron: Forget your bible Hermione, and help me with Harry.
Hermione: Sirius, the younger Harry whispered in shock. I— He— I would have gotten him killed.
Hermione: Come on Harry, Hermione said gently, and they exited the classroom.
Harry: Well, Harry said to himself, beaming invisibly about the room. I think that went swell.
Dumbledore: Ahem, Dumbledore coughed delicately, peering at Harry over his spectacles. Hello Harry. How are you this evening?
Harry: Great, he said weakly, shifting self-consciously from foot to foot. I’m just … great.
Dumbledore: Lovely. And if I may ask, what exactly is it, which is alive?
Harry: Well, nothing really. Except us of course. And I think there’s a spider living in the web up in that corner.
Dumbledore: And the red stains on your … interesting robes?
Harry: Tmmahss, he mumbled, ducking his head.
Harry: Tomato sauce, he admitted. It was for, you know, the theatre of it.
Dumbledore: I see, Dumbledore said, eyes lighting in understanding and approval. Well, it’s always good to enjoy your work. Speaking of, might you fill me in on why the house-elves reported that you’ve taken over this little tower room for said work?
Harry: No one was using it, judging by the layer of dust the elves had to clear up first. And I needed some lab space to brew a potion I developed in my time.
Harry: You developed it?
Harry: I understand your surprise. Snape pretty much destroyed my interest in potions from the first class. He waved off Dumbledore’s objections. Yes, yes he did. It wasn’t till I joined the Department of Mysteries and they started training me up, filling in my basic knowledge gaps, that I really got into it. Luna was my potions trainer, and the one who suggested the mad scientist thing might make it more fun. She was right. I turned out to be quite good at both brewing and invention.
Dumbledore: Very impressive, my boy. Dumbledore wandered closer, peering into his cauldron. And what does this potion do?
Harry: Defeats dark wizards and takes their Horcruxes with them, Harry said cheerfully."
7,757029,Luna,Dumbledore,"Luna: that I really got into it. Luna was my potions trainer, and the one who suggested the mad scientist thing might make it more fun. She was right. I turned out to be quite good at both brewing and invention.
Dumbledore: Very impressive, my boy. *wanders closer, peering into his cauldron* And what does this potion do?
Harry: Defeats dark wizards and takes their Horcruxes with them, *said cheerfully*.
Dumbledore: *gasps* Amazing! Has it been tested? You’ve told me you didn’t become an Unspeakable till well after Voldemort’s defeat, so you can’t have used it then.
Harry: Nope. Did things the old fashioned way with Voldie. The tedious way. And yes, it’s been tested. Somehow it slipped out after the war, how Voldemort managed his supposed immortality. Horcruxes became almost common knowledge, unfortunately. A few times the Aurors came to us for help in taking down Dark Wizards that seemed to keep inexplicably surviving. Worked like a charm every time. Doesn’t even damage the host items, which is good, because in one instance some bastard stored his soul shard in a unicorn, figuring we wouldn’t dare curse ourselves by killing it. It was fine though, potion didn’t hurt it. Ah, sir? Are you … crying?
Dumbledore: Just some dust in my eye, *choked out*.
Harry: It’s kind of you to say, but I don’t think it is.
Harry: Hey, want to help me brew a backup? *he suggested, hoping to cheer the man up, or at least distract him*.
Dumbledore: Yes, I think that would be grand. In fact. *waves his wand, turning his outer robe into a tomato sauce-splattered lab coat, then another to make his hair stick out madly like a certain famous physicist* There, that’s getting into the spirit of things!
Harry: What’s with the hair?
Dumbledore: Well, to match yours of course. Very ‘mad scientist’, *he complimented*.
Harry: You look fine, Albert, *he mumbled*."
8,757029,Albert,old man,"Albert: You look fine, Albert, he mumbled, and shoved the most disgusting ingredient within reach towards the old man. Here, disembowel these mucus toads.
Runty-Harry: Will that be enough? Runty-Harry asked, handing over a bag of galleons. I'm not sure how much de-aging potions cost.
Harry: Should be fine. If not, I do have a little saved from the last few weeks teaching. Now, do you understand your part?
Runty-Harry: Simple. Stay out of sight, don't give you away, don't face a death-defying task, etcetera. Believe you me, I'll do it gladly. You're sure my magic will be fine?
Harry: Positive. So long as 'Harry Potter' competes in the task, the cup will be appeased.
Runty-Harry: And you'll keep up your end of the bargain?
Harry: You do know the whole plan is to your benefit, right?
Runty-Harry: You promised.
Harry: Oh, fine, I won't call you 'Runty' anymore.

Harry: What's up, Mini-me? Harry asked. A sip of his Firewhisky hid the amused smile he sported at the boy's exasperated reaction to his new nickname. Thought you'd still be partying with the rest of the school.
Mini-Harry: Yeah, I'll head back in a minute. It's just ... I still don't get it, he said, a broad smile on his face despite his confessed confusion. The smile hadn't left since older Harry announced Voldemort was finally gone for good. I mean, shouldn't he have changed his plans when he heard of you? Everyone knows you're a time traveler. You knew what he was going to do!
Harry: Well, he would have, Harry admitted. Except I cornered Draco one day after class to give him a great big hug.
Mini-Harry: You ... hugged Malfoy? Mini-Harry gave his older self a disturbed look. Good god, why?
Harry: Because there's no way in hell I would, under normal circumstances. I gave the ferret the impression he and I were great buddies back in my world, ever since our first year. Draco slipped the info to his dad, who told old Voldie, who concluded that I must come from another reality entirely, rather than just further up a similar timeline. I also mentioned how I was surprised Crouch hadn't been caught yet, because in my world Dumbledore caught him out first week of classes. And also, Fudge had him Kissed right away, and we never did figure out what he'd been up to.
Mini-Harry: So he thought his plans were still safe, Mini-Harry said in understanding. Clever. And, you know, took guts. Hugging Malfoy, I mean. Really, talk about taking one for the team.
Harry: I know, Harry agreed gravely. I took a three-hour scalding shower after. Just to be sure I wasn't infected with any inbred stupidity. And to think, another few short years he'll be seventeen and get access to his daddy-deadest's fortune. Draco's not too bright, add some karma to that, and the Malfoy family will be ruined by the time you graduate.
Mini-Harry: Lucius Malfoy, Mini-Harry sighed dreamily.
Harry: Have you been drinking the twin's experimental punch? Or do I need to get you to a mind healer?
Mini-Harry: No! Eww. No."
9,757029,Harry,Mini-Harry,"Harry: Have you been drinking the twin’s experimental punch? Or do I need to get you to a mind healer?
Mini-Harry: No! Eww. No, just— You reminded me how he’s dead. And that reminded me of Snape.
Harry: Ah, front row view of Snape and Karkaroff keeling over dead, huh?
Mini-Harry: Especially Snape. He was on the end of a row. He clawed at his chest with this look of agony, and then he accidentally toppled right over the side of the stands.
Harry: Yeah. They’re still not sure whether it was the heart attack or the fall that killed him.
Mini-Harry: I will treasure the memory forever.
Harry: How did you even convince Dumbledore to go along with it anyway? I’d have thought for sure he’d object to all the Death Eaters being taken out along with Voldemort.
Harry: He didn’t know. Mainly because I didn’t know. I knew the potion wouldn’t damage the Horcrux host items—
Mini-Harry: Much appreciated.
Harry: No problem. But anyway, I had no idea Voldemort had linked his soul to his servants’ through the Dark Marks. Well, not until I force fed the Dork Lord the potion. Once second I’m admiring the view as his heart literally bursts out of his chest, and the black Horcrux cloud thing is expelled from Nagini. All expected. Somewhat less expected though was the bit where all the Death Eaters had simultaneous heart attacks. Gotta say though, I’m not regretting it.
Mini-Harry: Amen.
Harry: Back to the party with you. Oh, and just in case you were curious, Susan Bones had a massive crush on me all the way from second to sixth year. And she’s too sensible to go batshit like Gin-Bitch did.
Mini-Harry: Susan Bones? You mean… You’re sure?
Harry: Positive. Go ask her to dance or something. She won’t care if you step on her toes, that’s how bad she’s got it. Might even let you get in a grope.
Mini-Harry: Wow. Okay, I’ll just— Gotta go. Bye!"
10,757029,Harry,Mini-me,"Harry: I want to talk to you, *Harry hurried off in the same direction his Mini-me had gone.*
Sirius: What's up? *Sirius was happy to provide him a room at Padfoot’s Pad, the house he purchased the moment his pardon was signed.*
Harry: I don't mind Sirius stealing Amelia. *Harry didn’t mind Sirius stealing Amelia, on account of he drowned his sorrows in Firewhisky at the Three Broomsticks, and there found comfort in the arms of its buxom barmaid Rosmerta.*
Rosmerta: You did something stupid again! *She was used to dealing efficiently with rowdy customers, and wasn’t afraid to throw Harry out by the ear when he did something stupid.*
Harry: I claim Mini-me's brats as honorary grandchildren. *While they never had any kids, Harry claimed his Mini-me’s brats as honorary grandchildren.*
Mini-Harry: I'm staying at home. *When they decided to start a family, mini-Harry was the one to stay at home.*
Ron: Hey Harry! *Ron married Hermione, and Harry always had déjà vu when he saw their kids.*
Hermione: How are you doing? *Ron married Hermione, and Harry always had déjà vu when he saw their kids.*
Ginny: I'm never released from St Mungo's. *As for Ginny, she was never was released from St Mungo’s as the mind healers were never able to extract the ‘psycho bitch’ from her personality.*
Draco: I pauper myself. *Draco did indeed pauper himself in quick order.*
Fudge: Oops, I slipped in the tub and died. *Oh, and Fudge slipped in the tub and died, making way for a more competent minister.*"
