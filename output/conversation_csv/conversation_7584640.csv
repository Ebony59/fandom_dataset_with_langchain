Charlus: *turned to look at his wife with a raised eyebrow*
Dorea: *smiled and nodded*
James: Septima. *tugging on his right sleeve* Can I? *motioning to Septima's arms*
Septima: *reaching out, pulled the sleeve up on her left arm*
Septima: Where are your parents, dearie?
Dorea: At work.
Septima: What time do you have to leave?
James: I don't know.
Septima: My father said he would be back to pick me up later.
Charlus: Where do you want to go first?
Dorea: Robes.
James: *pouted*
Septima: *looked down at her hands*
Dorea: –delivered to the Manor.
Septima: How much?
Dorea: Don't worry about it, dearie. It's all covered.
Septima: *nodded, turning away*
Dorea: *sighed*
Charlus: *led James and Septima around the alley to collect their school supplies*
Septima: *tried several wands – more than James tried – until she found the right wand*
Ollivander: Eleven inches, alder, and unicorn hair. Excellent for non-verbal spells and healing.
Septima: *acted quickly to pay for her wand before the Potters could collect the bill*
Dorea: *smiled at the girl's eagerness*
Charlus: *led the group to Flourish and Blott*
James: *sighed*
Septima: *eagerly started exploring the bookstore*"
1,7584640,Dorea,Septima,"Dorea: We should give these to Septima on the first. *picks up The Standard Book of Spells, Volume One*
Charlus: *glances at her*
Dorea: You've noticed her frowns. She doesn't seem used to people buying her things. I want to hold off giving these to her until the first.
Charlus: *silently asking for an explanation*
Dorea: We need to convince her that she's a member of the family. Even if she and James aren't romantically linked, Septima is a Member of our House.

Dorea: *decided it was time to return to Potter Manor* Both James and Septima appeared to be asleep on their feet.

Dorea: *frowns at the house* It was old, rundown, and abandoned looking. If she didn't know any better, Dorea would assume no one lived there.
Septima: *knocks on the door*
Dorea: *joins Septima on the porch* The pair waited for a few minutes. Septima frowned while Dorea looked around. The property looked abandoned. There wasn't a car in the driveway and there wasn't anything on the porch.
Dorea: *pulls out her wand* Casting a non-verbal Alohomora, the door unlocked and Dorea pushed it open. She entered the house with Septima half a step behind her.
Septima: *frowns as she looks around the living room* Almost everything was gone.
Dorea: *follows behind the girl*

Dorea: *joins Septima on the bed* It looked like Septima would become a Member of House Potter sooner than expected.
Septima: How could they leave me? *tears began to form in her eyes*
Dorea: *starts rubbing the girl's back*"
2,7584640,Septima,Dorea,"Septima: How could they leave me? *tears began to form in her eyes*
Dorea: *frowned and started rubbing the girl's back*
Septima: *cried for a little before wiping her tears* What's gonna happen to me, now? *her voice small*
Dorea: You're coming home with me, and we're never going to leave you.
Septima: *nods, her eyes hardening* What's gonna happen to me, now?
Dorea: *enters the informal dining room* Septima, dearie, *lifts her arms*"
3,7584640,James,Septima,"James: Of course, dad.
Septima: *unsure of what to do*
Dorea: Septima, dearie.
Septima: *gives Dorea a hug* I'll miss you, dearie. Be sure to write – and make James write me, too.
Dorea: That girl's definitely a Potter.
Charlus: That she is, that she is.

James: What house do you think we'll be in?
Septima: *puts her textbook down* You'll be a Gryffindor. After all, Potters have been Gryffindors for centuries.
James: Maybe. What about you?
Septima: Maybe Hufflepuff or Ravenclaw.
James: *hopeful look* You could be a Gryffindor.
Septima: No matter what, we'll still be friends.
James: *not convinced*
Septima: *places her hand on his words* You won't get rid of me that easy.
James: *kisses Septima*
Septima: *returns the kiss*
James: I love you, Sept.
Septima: *blushes* I-I-I'm not going anywhere.
James: *accepts her answer*"
