1,7610077,Draco,Harry,"Draco: ? And wait a minute. You're actually gay?
Harry: No, I'm bisexual. But wouldn't you have assumed I was before you asked me to be your boyfriend?
Draco: I just sat next to the most attractive person in the cafe Potter. I didn't expect you to be interested in men. *Draco was suddenly looking as though a faint pink blush was ghosting his pale cheeks.*
Harry: I am very much interested in men. Especially ones who look like you. *Harry could sense his embarrassment, and decided flirting further was the best way to get his face even more pink, and he wondered briefly if he flushed like that anywhere else.*
Draco: I-er-well. Alright. Fine. Give me your mobile. *Draco snatched the phone out of Harry's hand and added in his contact before shoving it back into his palm and pointing at a block of knives. That one if you can afford it. It's a good useful gift that not many people think of. And it will match with anything.*
Harry: *Harry looked pleased as Draco stalked away, grabbing a set of knives and pulling it up to the register. Draco was long gone by the time Harry realized he has put an email address in instead of a phone number.*

Harry: It's pretty late, is this a bootycall, Malfoy?
Draco: No time for jokes Harry. *Harry now knew it was probably not a bootycall because although he had no problem calling Draco by his first name, Draco had only ever called him Harry once before, and that was when he was thanking him for the ride home from the wedding, extremely drunk.*
Harry: Alright, what's up then?
Draco: I've just gotten out of my studio and my thesis is almost done and I don't have time to talk to you about it so don't ask but my parents are throwing one of their stupid parties and I wasn't going to attend but they still invite Blaise's parents and he apparently showed up as well and mentioned that I now have a boyfriend and so my parents are insisting that I bring him and I'm panicking. *Draco had said this all very quickly in a singular breath.*
Harry: Wait, what?
Draco: Do you have a damned boyfriend Potter!
Harry: No, Draco I don't, but,
Draco: WELL YOU FUCKING DO NOW. TEXT ME YOUR ADDRESS. I AM COMING TO GET YOU.

Harry: Hey hot stuff, do you have a boyfriend?
Draco: Not for long if he doesn't hand me my damn coffee in the next two seconds. *Harry laughed and handed the cup over to a sleepy and grouchy Draco. He sat up and kissed him lightly.*
Harry: Ask me now.
Draco: Harry, this is a dumb game and I'm not playing it.
Harry: Ask me.
Draco: Does your goofy ass have a boyfriend? I'd be shocked if you did.
Harry: Ask nicely!
Draco: *Draco rolled his eyes so far back Harry thought they might get stuck.* Do you have a boyfriend?
Harry: Hopefully not in a few moments. *Harry deadpanned and Draco's eyes widened slightly.*
Harry: *Harry knelt on the ground and pulled out a box.* Do you have a husband?"
