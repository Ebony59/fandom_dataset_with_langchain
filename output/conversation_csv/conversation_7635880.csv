0,7635880,Sirius,James,"Sirius: You know, James. A normal person, in this situation would help their vertically challenged friend and get the book down for him.
James: A normal person would get the stool I pointed out on their way in.
Sirius: That is an insult to my punkness?
James: Uh gotta go Padfoot. You have fun.
Sirius: Right sure, go run off to your girlfriend and leave your best friend behind. You know the one you’ve had since you were eleven? You know when you were a scrawny nerd, friendless on your first day of boarding school? And I took pity on your titchy ass and decided you might someday grow into someone who would be cool enough to hang with me?
James: Great, knew you’d be cool with it. Thanks Pads.
Sirius: *scowled and flipped his friend off*
Sirius: Ok you can do this. Who’s the best footie player at school? That’s right you are. No matter what James said. Just because Minnie’s still pissed about the time you suggested she shave her legs if she wanted a date for Valentine’s and made James captain over you, does not mean he is a better player. Who scored the winning goal against Malfoy last year? That’s right you did."
1,7635880,Sirius,James,"Sirius: I want to talk to you, *Sirius took a great running leap, hand snatching furiously at the air as he sailed past his intended target.*
Sirius: *Sirius head whipped around and he almost fell over right there and then* uhhh,
Sirius: *nodding stupidly*
Sirius: *stuttering out a shaky thank you*
James: Hey, arsehole, you do realise that we’re all waiting for you right.
Sirius: James, I’m in love.
James: Oh for fuck’s sake. Hold on I’m putting you on speaker phone."
2,7635880,Sirius,Lily,"Sirius: Ok how can you be in love? I thought you had the hots for one of the Prewett twins just last week.
Lily: No, Lils. This guy is- He’s just- I can’t even- eugh.
Sirius: Just hold on, I’m sending you a photo.
James: Great now we’re in stalking territory.
Peter: Yeah, this is almost as bad as that time…
Marlene: He’s…
James: Tall…?
Lily: If I was single…
Marlene: He’s fucking hot.
Sirius: I know.
Marlene: Jesus Christ. I have half a mind to come take him for myself.
Sirius: Hey back off bitch.
Marlene: Don’t worry, love, you know I’m interested in that hot chick that works at the pub anyway.
James: Listen, is the guy still there?
Sirius: Yeah?
James: Then grow some balls and go ask him out, alright? You’ve got half an hour to do that and get over here, or we’re starting without you got it?

BLB: Listen Alice, I’ve got to go. You know some of us actually have a job. Yeah, yeah, I love you too."
3,7635880,Alice,Sirius,"BLB: Listen Alice, I’ve got to go. You know some of us actually have a job. Yeah, yeah, I love you too. *typing on keyboard*
Sirius: Sorry about that.
BLB: Don’t worry about it. How long have you and your girlfriend been together?
Sirius: My girl-? Oh you mean Alice. She’s not my girlfriend. Just a close friend. My best friend actually.
BLB: Got a library card?
Sirius: *hands over library card*
BLB: Didn’t have you pegged as a Lily. Oh no, I’m Sirius but my friend Lily’s a total nerd so I borrowed her card, knowing she had one to every library around. Not that being a nerd is a bad thing or anything. She’s read every book in every library at least twice. I swear she’s the smartest person I know. Reading’s just not my thing.
BLB: Well for someone who doesn’t read much, you’ve got good taste.
Sirius: You’re into French Lit.
BLB: Yeah, my Mam got me into them.
BLB: Well enjoy your books and have a nice day.
Sirius: *nods and steps away*
Sirius: You want to go out with me?
BLB: Why?
Sirius: Why should you go out with me or-
BLB: No, why do you want to go out with me?
Sirius: You read French Lit so I’m guessing you’re pretty bloody smart, you’re absolutely gorgeous and have the sexiest accent I’ve heard in my life.
BLB: Well alright then. Call me sometime, Sirius."
4,7635880,Remus,Sirius,"Remus: Well alright then, *plucked Sirius' wrist* Call me sometime, Sirius, *grinned before slipping away to help a customer*.

Sirius: *sank back against the hard edge with a sigh and a grin* By the way, my name is Remus, *traced the looping letters*.

Remus: *slipped away to help a customer*.

Sirius: *lifted his wrist to stare at the numbers* And if he needed another ten or so minutes before he was able to walk without the aid of the desk, well that was his own business, *noticed for the first time that BLB had added a message at the end*.

Remus: *slipped away to help a customer*.

Sirius: *sighed* Well his and the dozen or so other browsers who were looking at him with varying degrees of concern."
