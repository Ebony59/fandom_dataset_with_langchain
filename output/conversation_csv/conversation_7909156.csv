0,7909156,Tony Stark,Peter Parker,"Tony: Hey, kid, quittin' time. *called to the teen hunched over a mess of wires and spare parts.*
Peter: C'mon, Tony! It's not that late! And I'm almost finished with this!
Tony: Almost finished, my ass. *standing and wandering over to Peter's work table.* Besides, you've got school tomorrow. That's something you youngsters do, isn't it?
Peter: No? *Peter stood anyway, gathering his jacket from the bench next to him.*
Tony: *handed him his school bag and slung an arm over his shoulders as they walked to the elevator.* Say, Petey-Pie, you've never met a god before, have you?
Peter: I, uh, can't say that I have, *he responded.*
Tony: That's about to change! Hey, J, tell the guys I'm bringing Peter up with me to say hi. Tell Barton he's not allowed to be too much of a pain. Don't need Birdbrain scaring off my interns.
Peter: Weren't you just saying I have school tomorrow? I don't think now's the best time for a meet-and-greet.
Tony: You're a big boy, we can push your curfew back a little bit. *Tony paused a minute and took in Peter's nervous energy, his fingers twisting in the sleeves of his hoodie.* There's nothing to be worried about, kid. They're just people. Well, Thor's not. And Capsicle's from the 40s. Nat's probably 35% robot, but that's less than half, so Iâ€™d say weâ€™re good.
Peter: *leveled him an unimpressed glare.*
Tony: The best way to get over your fear is to dive right into it. It also, coincidentally, is the best way to get over your crush on a certain super-soldier, *he said, waggling his eyebrows.*
Peter: I do notâ€”!â€�
Peter: *The elevator doors opened. There, twenty feet in front of him, was Tony Stark's living room.* Iâ€” umâ€” hi, *Peter stammered.*"
1,7909156,Bruce,Peter,"Bruce: Hi, Peter, I'm guessing Tony dragged you up here?
Peter: He is my intern, I get to drag him wherever I want.
Peter: That is most definitely how internships work! And here I thought you were learning.
Tony: Anyway, I brought the kid up to meet you all before I drop him home.
Peter: That's right, wouldn't want to deny you your beauty sleep. Look's like you might need it.
Hawkeye: Keep this one, Stark.
Tony: That's the plan, Katniss.
Captain America: Nice to meet you, Captain Rogers.
Peter: Call me Steve.
Falcon: Sam.
Hawkeye: Or, as I like to call him, the second best bird-themed superhero in this Tower.
Peter: Is there another one I should know about?
Black Widow: Ignore Clint. I'm Natasha.
Peter: The key is to just ignore him and nod a lot when he won't go away.
Thor: Indeed, it takes a strong will to bear our good friend's antics. It is nice to meet you, Peter.
Peter: Y-you too, sir.
Tony: How come you call him 'sir'? I'm your boss, Parker, and I don't get a 'sir'?"
2,7909156,Thor,Peter,"Thor: It is nice to meet you, Peter. *Thor's huge hand engulfs Peter's slim fingers.*
Peter: Y-you too, sir.
Tony: How come you call him 'sir'? I'm your boss, Parker, and I don't get a 'sir'?
Peter: You threatened to make Dummy help me with my projects if I ever called you 'sir', sir. *Peter raised his hands in an oh well gesture.*
Tony: That sounds like something I might say. Then again, maybe I have been rubbing off on you and that's why you haven't run screaming for the hills.
Clint: I don't even want to think about having a second Tony around. One is more than enough.
Tony: Yeah, yeah, wait until you're looking for another gear upgrade. *Tony takes a seat, pulling Peter down with him.*
Peter: *Peter gets the feeling the man had totally forgotten about taking him home. Not that he minded. While talking to Earth's Mightiest Heroes was nerve-wracking, Peter thought he might be enjoying himself.*
Tony: So what are you guys up to?
Sam: We were trying to get Cap to have another go at the hammer. *Sam gestured with his hand to the hammer sitting on the ground next to the coffee table.*
Thor: There is no trickery, my friend.
Peter: What's it made out of?
Thor: An Asgardian metal called Uru. It was forged in the heart of a dying star.
Peter: Really? *Peter scooted forward to get a better look.*
Thor: Would you like to try and lift it?
Peter: *Peter's head snapped around.* Are— are you serious? Can I?
Thor: *Thor nodded, smiling.*
Tony: *Tony nudged him and Peter stood.*
Peter: *Peter wrapped his fingers around the handle. For a moment he was unsure whether to even try. What if he used too much strength? He couldn't afford to out himself like this. Then again, when would he ever get another chance to be this close to Thor's hammer, let alone touch it? Mind made up, Peter pulled.*
Peter: I-I thought it'd be heavier. *Peter said, smiling weakly. He looked around at the stunned faces around him. Thor’s face was blank, his eyes wide.* What-what’s wrong? D-did I do something wrong? *Nearly dropping the hammer back on the table, Peter wiped his hands on his jeans as if trying to erase ever having touched it. He turned around and saw Tony beaming wildly at him.*
Tony: You did everything right, kiddo. Let's get you home. *Tony rose and led him toward the elevator. Peter managed a good-bye before the doors closed over the Avengers' slack-jawed faces. Tony was still grinning.*
Peter: Uh, what the hell was that?
Tony: Nothing much. But you might be inheriting the throne of Asgard sometime in the future.
Peter: Wait, what?"
