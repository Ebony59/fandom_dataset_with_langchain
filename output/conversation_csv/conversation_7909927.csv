0,7909927,Hermione,Ron,"Hermione: I am very surprised the Waggleshoots didn't warn me that I'd be performing a wedding ceremony today. Normally they warn me of such unexpected events. *ruffling through the pages of the book*
Hermione: That's great Ron but what I was really trying to ask was...
Ron: Harry had to check on Ginny for himself but he'll be right back. He said he thought we deserved to hear everything. Not like we've really had time for an in-depth discussion lately and I definitely want to hear about what made him nutters enough to give himself up like that.
Hermione: What are you talking about Ron?
Harry: No one told you about Fred? I thought you were there when it happened.
Hermione: I saw him fall when the wall collapsed but he was fine. Was something broken or something?"
1,7909927,Fred,Hermione,"Ron: No one told you about Fred? I thought you were there when it happened.
Hermione: I saw him fall when the wall collapsed but he was fine. Was something broken or something?
Harry: Fred isn't okay. He was killed during that explosion. We thought you knew already.
Ron: And I don't know why you look so upset anyways. You and Fred were never really close but the family will want you there anyways. Mum and Ginny will certainly appreciate seeing you.
Harry: I know Ron's an insensitive git but now is not the time to fight about it.
Hermione: I wasn't about to start a fight. I have to see Fred.
Ron: Why are you rushing off so fast? There's nothing you can do to help him since he's already dead.
Harry: I don't know what's going on either but we should go to the Great Hall so we can find out.
Ginny: Stop making such a fuss Hermione! Mum and Dad have every right to say goodbye and grieve before the rest of us.
Hermione: Fred is not dead!
Bill: Fred is not dead!
Arthur: What's going on Hermione?
Hermione: I need to see Fred more closely.
Mrs. Weasley: Fred is still alive Mrs. Weasley.
Ginny: I tried to stop her Mum but she's being very stubborn.
Molly: I love you like a daughter dear but you have no right to push through my family and upset them more than they already are. I'm his Mum and I'd know more than anyone whether or not he was dead.
Hermione: *casting a nonverbal spell to prevent anyone from following her*"
2,7909927,Hermione,Fred Weasley,"Hermione: What are you doing? *whipping her wand out and casting a nonverbal spell to prevent anyone from following her. Her one hand held tight to her locket while she placed the other on Fred's chest.*
George: What in the hell is going on?
Hermione: Go to Madame Pomfrey and tell her that Fred Weasley is most definitely alive but needs to be stabilized before his transfer to St. Mungo's.
Mrs. Weasley: I have no idea what you are doing young lady. I would know if my son were alive or not. You may be known as the smartest witch of your age but ˗
Madame Pomfrey: Hermione can you please allow me near Mr. Weasley?
Hermione: Of course.
Madame Pomfrey: You're right. The signals are faint but Fred Weasley is certainly alive. At least for now.

Hermione: Hey Harry.
Harry: They're all just really upset. Mrs. Weasley doesn't understand how you knew and she didn't.
Hermione: I'm not ready to explain that just yet.

Healer Calder: Mr. Weasley is very much alive though he is in a sleep-like state similar to being Petrified.
Healer Mugwort: But there is bad news.
Mr. Weasley: How bad?
Healer Mugwort: He was hit with a curse none of the staff have ever seen in person. It's known as the Heart's Desire spell. He will only regain consciousness if he is reminded of the last thought he held dear to his heart before he was hit with the curse.
Calder: We suggest you go into Fred's room in small groups and see if any of you can come up with the correct memory. The faster the better. We wish you the best of luck."
3,7909927,Molly,Freddie,"Molly: Let me fix my face first. I don't want Freddie to be worried when he wakes up. *pulls her wand out of her robes* Don't get your hopes up too much Molly dear. From the sounds of it this isn't going to be easy.
Arthur: *presses his hand gently against the small of Molly's back* He's our son Arthur. We should know him better than anyone except perhaps George.
Molly: *pulls Fred's hand into her own* Percy said they were laughing together right before the curse hit. He was surrounded by his brothers so perhaps he was thinking of what you told them in the Room of Requirement before the battle started.
Arthur: And you are certain they were in the Lestrange's vault and that they made it out safely?
Molly: What's going on?
Molly: We will meet you there. Be careful son."
4,7909927,Molly,Fred,"Molly: I'm sorry I yelled at you for bringing Ginny along.
Fred: That's okay mum.
George: You were just being our mum. It wouldn't be right if you didn't.
Molly: No matter what happens I will always be your mum and I will always love you. Now let's go finish this war.
Fred: I thought you didn't want any of us fighting.
Molly: Just because I don't want any of you hurt but when it comes to spellwork I am very glad to know that the two of you will be fighting for us.
Arthur: We have been so proud of you son. You've always stood up for what is right and we are looking forward to the brave young man you are becoming.
Molly: *collapsed against the back of her chair with a sob*
Arthur: There's a waiting room full of people with memories that might help Fred. We have to hope that one of them will succeed.
Arthur: Bill and Charlie? Maybe the two of you should be next.
Bill: If he was thinking of us at all do you think it would have been an old memory or a new one?
Charlie: I don't know mate. Wouldn't hurt to try one of each, would it?
Charlie: If we were thinking of my favorite memories of you then I'd have to mention the day you and George were born but I doubt you'd remember that so…Well I know when I'm in a bad situation I fall back on the memory I use to conjure my Patronus. So maybe you thought of flying too.
Bill: I knew you'd be just as interested in flying as I was when you followed me out to the yard to watch me fly when you and George were just bitty tykes. I got into so much trouble when mum found out I was taking you on rides.
Charlie: But I taught you everything I knew even though it was obvious what position you and George would take if you made the Quidditch team.
Bill: From the moment we saw you play that Muggle game with the ball and the bat we knew you'd make fantastic Beaters. You were both right dangerous with bats and clubs."
5,7909927,Charlie,George,"Charlie: I want to talk to you, Charlie spoke. But I taught you everything I knew even though it was obvious what position you and George would take if you made the Quidditch team.
Bill: Too right, Bill interjected. From the moment we saw you play that Muggle game with the ball and the bat we knew you'd make fantastic Beaters. You were both right dangerous with bats and clubs.
Charlie: *grimaced, remembering all the bruises and headaches either his mum or Madame Pomfrey had taken care of over the years because Fred or George had smacked him with a Bludger. There had been quite a few concussions as well.*
Charlie: I was a little worried when I became Captain in your second year since I knew you and George would try out for the team. I knew you'd have to be the absolute best or everyone would think I put you on the team just because you were family. But I needn't have worried at all. You were perfect and the looks on your faces when you were flying were just ecstatic. And I hope you were as happy to become my teammates as I was to have you.
Bill: I never saw you on a broomstick without a smile even when we were all disguised as Harry and running from Death Eaters, Bill admitted.
Bill: When I first asked Fleur to marry me I was worried about the wedding. I could tell that most of the family didn't like her but I was hoping all of you would understand that I saw something different in her. Something the rest of you didn't see. But then one day I saw a look in your face and I realized you understood.
Bill: I started watching you closer because I knew there was a girl in your life. Someone you weren't willing to tell us about. And then on my wedding day I knew. You two hardly even spoke, at least not in front of us, but I could tell by the way you looked at her.
Charlie: *looked at Bill in surprise but didn't interrupt.*
Bill: I can't say I wasn't surprised when she looked back at you in the same way, Bill continued. So I have a feeling she's going to be the one who you were thinking of at the end but I doubt mum would believe me if I demanded Hermione be sent in here right away.
Bill: Don't mention what I just said to anyone. I don't think they have any idea and it would be a shock to them if they didn't hear it from Hermione or Fred.
Charlie: *nodded.* One thing's certain. If you're right we're going to have to make sure Hermione gets in there quickly.
Bill: She probably already would be if mum hadn't pulled her wand on her earlier. Though I'm not sure Hermione even really noticed.
Harry: Hermione Granger is next to a book and she isn't reading it? Harry asked in mock surprise as he took a seat across from the young witch. Whatever is this world coming to?
Hermione: I'm not really in the mood for jokes right now Harry, Hermione sighed. She took a long swig of her vanilla latte and avoided his eyes. Why aren't you in there consoling Ginny?
Harry: She has the rest of her family to console her, Harry said. He pulled Hermione's scone over and pinched a corner, watching the pasty disintegrate into a fine dust. I know Mr. and Mrs. Weasley love me like family but I can't help but blame myself for this. If I hadn't gotten so close to the Weasley's then Fred wouldn't be in the hospital right now.
Hermione: *looked up in surprise.* This isn't your fault, it's Voldemort's. He would've done the same thing, started the same war whether it had been you or Neville. He would've attacked Muggleborns and bloodtraitors even if there had never been a prophecy, she hissed under her breath. With or without Harry Potter the Weasley's would've stood up to that."
6,7909927,Hermione,Voldemort,"Hermione: This isn't your fault, it's Voldemort's. He would've done the same thing, started the same war whether it had been you or Neville. He would've attacked Muggleborns and bloodtraitors even if there had never been a prophecy, she hissed under her breath. With or without Harry Potter the Weasley's would've stood up to that tyrant.
Harry: Ginny may want me with her when she goes in but that won't be for a while. George just went in to talk with him and I'm sure he has tons of memories to share. Though I'm starting to think he won't be the one who will get Fred to wake up.
Hermione: I'm not sure what you mean, Hermione said. She took another sip of her latte and slowly ate a bite of her scone.
Harry: I may be dense but I'm a hell of a lot more aware of things than Ron is, Harry pointed out. Why haven't you just told Mrs. Weasley about your relationship with Fred? Maybe she would have let you in to see him already.
Hermione: Mrs. Weasley would never believe me. We were so careful around the family and she obviously had no clue or we would have heard about it. You know how she gets about her children's relationships.
Harry: How long? Harry asked quietly.
Hermione: My feelings for him started my second year when the twins supported you during the whole Chamber of Secrets debacle. But I didn't find out Fred liked me back until after the Yule Ball.
Harry: You've been together since our Fourth Year? Wow. It must be serious.
Hermione: You have no idea, she muttered. Her left hand snaked up until it was clutching her locket and she closed her eyes. Dear Merlin let him come out of this alive and well.
Bill: There you are! Bill sighed in relief as he slid into the last chair at the small table. Charlie was forced to awkwardly stand off to the side.
Hermione: Why are you here? Is there something wrong?
Bill: No changes for good or bad, Charlie admitted. Everyone's already gone in to see him and nothing's happened. Mum thinks we should grab a bite to eat and try to brainstorm more things to remind Fred of, Bill explained. She wanted us to get the two of you and see if you have any ideas.
Harry: How about it Hermione? You ready to give it a try? I'm sure if Fred isn't awake yet then Mrs. Weasley won't question it much if you talk to him.
Hermione: The look in Hermione's eyes was fierce as she stood up, shoving her chair so hard that it banged against the table behind her. I'd like to see her try and stop me now.
Charlie: Is it wrong that I'd like to see Hermione confront mum? Charlie asked.
Harry: Harry and Bill couldn't help but roll their eyes.
Healer Calder: We were able to obtain a private room for you to discuss your options, Healer Calder explained. It is just down the hall so we will easily be able to alert you to any changes in Mr. Weasley's vitals.
Mrs. Weasley: How is he doing now? Mrs. Weasley asked. Her voice trembled but she stood up straight and tall.
Healer Mugwort: Healer Mugwort's expression was grim. Everything is slowing down but not enough to cause permanent damage if he is woken soon. Now is the time to contact anyone and everyone who could possibly hold the key to Fred's last memory.
Bill: Bill leaned down to whisper in Hermione's ear. You're up. Good luck. Then he gently pushed her towards the Healer's.
Hermione: I'd like to speak to Fred, she announced as the rest of the Weasley's turned to stare at her."
7,7909927,Hermione,Fred,"Hermione: Definitely blame the shoes. Those things are evil.
Fred: Hey! I don't know if I should be yelling at you for almost hitting me or if I should ask what your shoes did to deserve that.
Hermione: This isn't going to turn my face blue when I use it, will it?
Fred: The color changing one is in the pocket of my other robe. He waited until she had gently wiped her eyes before piping up. That one just turns your hair pink. If I would've known the color of your robes I could have coordinated better.
Hermione: You didn't!"
8,7909927,Hermione,Fred,"Hermione: Fred?
Fred: Hermione? What are you doing in here?
Hermione: Reading, or at least attempting to. What are you doing in here?
Fred: Nothing. I'll just leave you to it.
Hermione: Does this have anything to do with the doxies you stole earlier?
Fred: You used magic outside of school and you're still underage!"
9,7909927,Fred,Hermione,"Fred: Nothing, *started edging towards the door* I'll just leave you to it.
Hermione: *whipped out her wand and cast a spell* Does this have anything to do with the doxies you stole earlier?
Fred: You used magic outside of school and you're still underage! *walked over and sat in an armchair*
Hermione: It's not that big of a deal, *admitted* There are so many wizards in the house that the Ministry wouldn't bother to check unless it was something big. Plus there are so many wards up they may not know anything about it at all.
Fred: But why did you lock me in here with you anyways? *a smirk appeared on his face* Was there something you wanted?
Hermione: I want to know why you took the doxies.
Fred: You're not going to let that go, are you? Please don't tell mum!
Hermione: And I won't tell her as long as you tell me what you plan on doing with them. Doxy venom can be very dangerous, *lectured*
Fred: George and I are already aware of that Little Miss Know-it-all, *pointed out* We are going to be careful. No trial runs on anyone until after George and I have tested it on ourselves. Unless you want us to use Crookshanks?
Hermione: *threw a pillow at him* I know you must be smart or else you wouldn't be able to come up with some of your little pranks but I think you might need some extra help. Especially if you're going to have people ingest such volatile substances as doxy venom. I'm guessing it's meant to be ingested?
Fred: Are you offering to help us Ms. Granger?
Hermione: I'll help you, *corrected* But you are not to tell anyone of my involvement and if I see you hurting anyone with your items then I will reprimand you and I may go so far as to tell your mother.
Fred: Why would you help me? *couldn't help but ask as he flopped down on the couch next to her*
Hermione: Your pranks and items amuse people and some, like the Expendable Ears, are actually useful. And no matter what your mum says I know you will continue on with this shop of yours that you're planning. I may as well make sure you're using money wisely and that you're not hurting anyone.
Fred: It will be easy enough to meet up in secret here since George knows I'm using the libraries for research. Once we reach Hogwarts I'll probably have to tell George that I have an anonymous consultant, *he mused*
Hermione: *pulled out a few scraps of parchment and a quill* Well to start off there's a few books about magical creatures on the third shelf, *she pointed out*
Fred: *summoned the book*"
10,7909927,Fred,Hermione,"Fred: Merlin Hermione. You make it seem like my brother would walk in on a passionate love affair instead of charms and potion making. *He turned to her and saw how red her face had gotten.* Unless you want privacy so we can start a passionate love affair, *he teased as he casually leaned closer to her.*
Hermione: Maybe I do. What would you say to that?
Fred: Finally. *grinned as he pulled her to him.*
...
Fred: What exactly would you be doing on a date with Harry?
Hermione: Nothing because I'm not interested in Harry like that but I'm betting Cho was picturing something like this, *Hermione whispered as she straddled Fred's lap.* And this. *She trailed her lips down his neck.* And this. *She slid her hands under his sweater as her lips moved to capture Fred's in a deep kiss.*
Fred: *Before it could go much farther Fred gently pulled away.* So do you have any ideas for the fireworks?
Hermione: *Hermione couldn't help but smile as she wondered how she had ever got so lucky.* I do have an idea. We're doing this to annoy Umbridge because we don't want to comply with any of her decrees. When my dad wanted me to know something would never happen he'd say 'when pigs fly.'
...
Fred: If this works out as well as I hope then George is going to start getting suspicious. We've never had so many successes in a row, Fred declared.
Hermione: *Hermione smiled.* Although she had offered to help test the products Fred hardly ever let her. He said she'd had enough injuries to last a lifetime and he didn't want to test anything that could be too dangerous on her. After eating nougat that caused her to projectile sneeze blue goo she had quickly agreed.
Fred: *Fred pulled off his goggles and pulled her over to the couch.* You're being awfully quiet today. What's on your mind?
Hermione: *Hermione took a deep breath.* You and George should be ready. Harry's about to reach his breaking point.
Fred: *Fred sighed and pulled her close.* I'll write to you everyday if you don't mind Filch or Umbridge reading our letters, *he whispered.* And we only have a few weeks until you'll be done with classes too. You'll be spending time at the Burrow with us before you know it."
11,7909927,Hermione,Fred,"Hermione: Let me say goodbye to Harry and the Weasley's and then we can go home. It's been a rough year.
Hermione: I'll write to you every day, *whispered before turning around to whisk her parents away.*
Hermione: What's all this for?
Fred: I know why we've been hiding our relationship for so long but now I think it's time for everyone to know. I want to be able to tell my family how much I love you."
12,7909927,Hermione,Fred,"Hermione: Maybe we should tell everyone but you do know I'm going to be leaving with Harry and Ron soon, *she pointed out as she pulled back far enough that she could search Fred's eyes.*
Fred: I know, *Fred admitted.* But I've decided I can't let you go without this.
Hermione: *watched in confusion as Fred stepped back and fumbled through his pockets.* Then he dropped to one knee and time seemed to stop.
Fred: *stared up at her and took a deep breath before beginning.* Hermione Jane Granger I love you with all my heart and soul. I can't picture living my life without you no matter how much time we have left. Regardless of this war I know I want nothing more than to have you as my wife. Will you marry me?
Hermione: *For once Hermione didn't stop to think because she already knew the answer.* Yes of course I'll marry you!
Fred: *Before she knew it Fred was sliding a ring onto her ring finger and she was pulling him into a kiss that left them both breathless.* He gently guided her back to the blanket amid kisses and giggles of happiness.
Hermione: *They lost track of time as they kissed and whispered sweet nothings in each other's ears.* When the first rays of sun made their appearance Hermione sighed and sat up. We better get back to the Burrow. I'm sure Fleur will be forcing all the girls to wake up and help her anytime now.
Fred: Before we get up I want to tell you something about the ring, *Fred said as he reached down and gently grabbed her left hand in his own.*
Hermione: What about it? *She looked down at the ring. She didn't know much about jewelry but knew it was a princess cut solitaire, probably about a caret or two.* You're not about to tell me this ring used to belong to a Death Eater or something, are you?
Fred: *snorted.* I don't know a single Death Eater that would be willing to give my family a ring. No it's nothing bad. No need to jump to the worst possible conclusions.
Hermione: *blushed.* It's just so beautiful I was afraid whatever took you so long to say would be awful.
Fred: Actually I hope that what I'm about to tell you will make the ring even lovelier, *Fred said as he fumbled around in his pockets again before finally pulling out another jewelry box.* He opened it and grabbed a gold ring which he had Hermione slip upon his own ring finger. I know it's not traditional for a Muggle man to wear a ring during the engagement but I have my reasons.
Hermione: *couldn't help but smile.* I like the idea of you wearing a ring, *she admitted.* It's like we belong to one another.
Fred: It's not just that. I hope you don't mind but I enchanted them. Since we slipped the rings on each other's fingers the magic is binding.
Hermione: *heart started pounding.* She fully believed Fred was a kind and caring man who wasn't the least bit jealous of her friendships with Harry and Ron but she couldn't keep her mind from racing. Would the ring curse her if she got too friendly with the boys? Was that the enchantment? What do you mean by enchanted?
Fred: Just concentrate on the ring. Do you feel anything unusual?
Hermione: *closed her eyes and concentrated, her eyes popping open when she felt it.* The ring feels like it's warm. Not hot but it's a pleasant feeling.
Fred: Mine feels that way too. It means you're alive. The rings are connected to both of us so if one of us dies the other will know because the rings will turn ice cold. I know that sounds a little morbid and I'm sorry about that but we are in a war.
Hermione: And it will work no matter how far apart we are? *Hermione looked at the ring in surprise.* The enchantment Fred was talking about was something she had never heard about.
Fred: It will unless you want me to lift the enchantment. *Fred nodded.*
Hermione: *smiled and reached out to grasp Fred's hand.*"
13,7909927,Hermione,Fred,"Hermione: And it will work no matter how far apart we are? *Hermione looked at the ring in surprise. The enchantment Fred was talking about was something she had never heard about.*
Fred: It will unless you want me to lift the enchantment. *Fred nodded.*
Hermione: *Hermione smiled and reached out to grasp Fred's hand and gasped in surprise when the ring grew warmer and started to glow.* No I like the idea. If anything were to happen to you I'd rather know right away.
Fred: *Fred smiled in relief.* I was hoping you'd see it that way because that's exactly why I did it. But I don't want to announce anything until after Bill and Fleur are married. Today should be about them.
Hermione: That is very thoughtful of you. But what about the rings? *Hermione couldn't help but ask.* We can't really hide our engagement if I go walking into your house with this diamond on my finger.
Fred: *Fred fingered the locket he had given her the previous Christmas.* I'm going to charm my ring so that no one but the two of us will be able to see it and I thought we could shrink yours and put it in here, *he said as he tapped her locket.*
Hermione: *Hermione smiled as he opened the locket and held it in the palm of his hands.* I know a spell we can use to prevent the clasp from breaking under almost any circumstances. That way it will be safe while you're doing whatever you need to do with Harry and Ron.
Fred: It's perfect, *Hermione said before she leaned up to give Fred a deep kiss.*"
14,7909927,Fred,Hermione,"Fred: That didn't go too badly, did it?
Hermione: You got married?!
Fred: I know this came as a shock Molly, Mrs. Weasley, but I love your son very much. I know we'll need to talk about this but I don't think right now is a very good time so maybe you can yell at us about it when Fred's not in St. Mungos.
Mrs. Weasley: How...but...honestly how did you keep this a secret for so long?
Fred: I know George enough to get around him and if I can hide something from George then I could hide it from anyone.
George: I just want to know how you managed to snag such an attractive bird. It's not fair! And how did you get around your two boys here, Hermione?
Harry: All she had to do was tell us she was going to the library and we'd never suspect anything different. And she knew more about the Marauder's Map than I did so she knew the Room of Requirement was untraceable.
Mrs. Weasley: Quiet everyone! I know we all have questions but Fred needs rest. Perhaps we should leave them alone for the time being."
15,7909927,Mrs. Weasley,Fred,"Mrs. Weasley: Quiet everyone! *put her hands on her hips and glared around* I know we all have questions but Fred needs rest. Perhaps we should leave them alone for the time being.

Hermione: *mouth dropped open*

Mrs. Weasley: We have many things to talk about dear but your stories go to show how much you love my son and your love helped save him. That's all a mother could ask for.

Ginny: It's jut like Bill and Fleur all over again. We think mum's going to go nutters and then she gets all sappy instead.

Harry: You sound like you wanted Hermione and your mum to battle it out. *voice low*

Charlie: My Galleons would be on Hermione.

Ron: You would've lost that bet. Sorry Hermione but mum did call Bellatrix a bitch before she took her out.

Fred: *snickered* For some reason I don't think it would be in my best interest to pick sides on this.

Mrs. Weasley: Will you all quiet down!


Mrs. Weasley: I already said we need to leave, don't make me repeat myself! Once Fred is cleared you should let me know and I'll cook us all a nice family dinner, okay dears? *left*

Fred: *pulled Hermione's hand to get her attention* Now they know you're a Weasley they're going to drive you even more batty than ever before. Are you ready?

Hermione: *smiled and climbed back into the bed* I've been ready for ages."
16,7909927,Hermione,Fred,"Hermione: I want to talk to you. *giggles as Fred swung her around the dance floor after their vows* It certainly wasn't our first dance as a married couple since there had been countless balls celebrating the defeat of Voldemort but it was still special. We had pledged our love to one another in front of our family and friends and it felt wonderful.
Fred: When we first met did you ever think we'd end up here? *whispers into her ear*
Hermione: Of course not but I wouldn't change this for the world.
Fred: I was hoping you'd say something like that. I can't picture myself with anybody else. *pulls her even closer, so close that they were barely even dancing anymore*"
