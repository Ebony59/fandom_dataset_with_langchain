0,7945231,Sirius,James,"Sirius: Please ignore Prongs, *quickly refills the coffee machine and pushes a button so it starts brewing.*
James: You'd better pick up a pace, mate, the morning wave's approaching, *tells him with a grin and winks at the hipster boy who looks even more lost than he did before.*
Sirius: If it weren't for Lily, I would tell Pete you smoke during your shift again, *tells him to shut him up while he is making milk foam.*
James: I'm, at least, not flirting with a customer, *whispers behind his back.*
Sirius: *feels his cheeks heat up and yanks his head to look at said customer.*
Sirius: Enjoy, *smiles at the guy.*
Customer: *beams back thankfully and places down a pound too much for the coffee on the counter.*
Sirius: *always tries to give him the change but the boy just waves, turns around and walks out without wishing them a great day.*
Sirius: God, *sighs, leaning against the counter as if he has just defeated something great.* It's harder with every day.
James: I can't bloody believe you fell for a customer you don't even know, *shakes his head and starts brewing himself a coffee as well.*
Sirius: Oi, *looks at him with a genuinely hurt expression.* I do know him! I mean- we've talked plenty of times, I know a lot about him.
James: *eyes him, smiling sarcastically.* Then what's his name?
Sirius: I mean who cares what his name is? *huffs, leaning against the wall.* Not like I don't, just... there're more important things, you know?
Lily: *snickers at him from behind her cider.* James told me he's a cutie, though.
Sirius: Don't even get me started on it, *sighs dramatically.*
Lily: Wow, okay, *puts up her hands.* So tell me about him, Casanova. What is he like?
Sirius: Well, *frowns.* He's really sweet indeed. He has that hipster style, you know, he has beautiful olive eyes but he always looks like he's tired. He might be, he's at uni, learning Art and his parents are the sweetest people, and he loves wolves and he's obsessed with The Beatles and chocolate and-
James: *chimes in from behind him as he arrives.* He's rambling about Moony again, isn't he? *asks and kisses Lily on the cheek.*
Sirius: *punches him on the arm and sits down at the table, opposite to them.*
Lily: *frowns, looking at her boyfriend.* Moony?
James: *grins.* Yeah, Sirius gave him that nickname, *grins and Sirius just pokes his tongue at him.*
Lily: Aww, *coos.* Well, we need to call him something, don't we?"
1,7945231,Sirius,Moony,"Sirius: Moony?
Lily: Yeah, Sirius gave him that nickname.
James: Aww.
Sirius: Well, we need to call him something, don’t we? And it fits. His pale face, his wolf obsession, his late night drawing sessions-
James: And how do you know about those, exactly?
Sirius: I told you, we talk a lot.
Frontman: What’s up, everyone?
Sirius: A w’skey, please!
Bartender: Sorry, bud.
Sirius: What y’ mean you’re sorry? Gimme a whiskey, mate!
Bartender: Dude, one more word an’ I get ya kicked out.
Sirius: Hey.
Moony: Moony!
Sirius: He belongs to ya?
Bartender: Damn right I am!
Sirius: He’s mine an’ I’m his and we make out an’ I top and he-
Bartender: ’kay, ‘kay, jus’ take ‘im outta here, will ya?
Sirius: Where’re we goin’?
Moony: Sit down.
Sirius: *sits down*"
2,7945231,Sirius,Moony,"Sirius: Sit down, *Moony talks to him softly* How are you?
Moony: Just a friend, *looks at Sirius with a small smile* How are you?
Sirius: You found me in the middle of a fuckin' bar w' this concert and I'm bloody hammered an' you askin' me how I am?
Moony: Are you always like this when you drink?
Sirius: Onl' understand the happy part, *Sirius tells him with a wide smile* But nah, only when I've such a pretty boy w' me.
Sirius: Aww, Moony, so cute when you blush, *coos at the boy and clumsily reaches up to caress his cheek* Why do you keep calling me Moony?
Moony: 'Cause that's y'name? Dumbo, *Moony chuckles and adds quietly: But keep it, I like it.*
James: Oh, god, what did you get yourself into this time?
Sirius: What you doin' here, Prongsy? You ruinin' the mood.
Lily: Haven't even shown you m' tattoo, *Sirius tells him with a grin and simply pulls up his shirt on his torso*
James: Yeah, that's- uhh something he totally shows everyone when he's drunk, *James says in an apologetic voice and yanks Sirius to his feet*
Lily: Thanks for keeping him safe, Moony, *Lily smiles at him*
James: Yeah, but it's time for him to go home, *James nods and grabs his friend*
Sirius: *waves at him sadly*
Moony: *waves back*"
3,7945231,Sirius,Lad,"Sirius: Even looking at you makes my mouth feel dry. *walks to the tap and drenches himself with water* If you can't work today-
Peter: I can. *smiling smugly as he readies some cups by the kettle* You had a fun night, I've heard.
Sirius: James Prongs Potter is a gossiping little- *interrupted by the bell on the door tingling*
Lad: Hello there.
Sirius: Good morning. *tries to look at the lad's eyes without feeling uncomfortable*
Lad: Nice shirt. *smiles*
Sirius: Thanks. *nods with a matching smile* I didn't even know I had this shirt, I mean it's from like junior year, not like I have grown much since and I kinda knew you were about to fall in today, too, so- *stops rambling and looks down at his hands*
Lad: Yes, I like it. *smiles* A latte with extra brown sugar, please.
Sirius: I wanted to thank you. *braver now that the lad's eyes are not staring at his face* For yesterday, I mean. I could have gotten into some serious crap if you hadn't come for me.
Lad: It's okay. *reassures him*
Sirius: You were surprised? *grinning* I mean, who knew you listened to that band?
Lad: I don't, actually. *admits with a small, apologetic smile* A friend requested them to me. It was a great night, though, so I regret nothing.
Sirius: Yeah, amazing concert. *lying* School today?
Lad: No. *smiles* It's Saturday, you know.
Sirius: Fuck, right. *laughs*"
4,7945231,Sirius,Moony,"Sirius: It's Saturday, you know.
Moony: Fuck, right.
Sirius: *cracks up*
Moony: *joins in, chuckling with him*
Sirius: *feels his guts heat up with the familiar feeling of the boy in front of him* I want to tell him how pretty and breath-taking he looks but it would probably be creepy. Most certainly.
Sirius: *pours the milk and the coffee together on the brown sugar until it forms a perfect latte* I was feeling a little off today, but you definitely turned me on.
Moony: *sips his coffee and opens up his notebook*
Sirius: Why did he- why did he sit down? He never- he just doesn’t-
Peter: Well, he’s a customer, he has the right. Don’t disturb my customer, okay? You’ve caused enough excitement for him today already.
Sirius: What do you mean?
Peter: Nothing, Romeo, it’s nothing.
Sirius: *concentrates on the paper intensely, just sometimes looking up, probably when he feels Moony’s gaze on himself*
Moony: *stands up from his table and steps to the counter with his cup between his slender fingers*
Sirius: You know, I would’ve given you coffee in a glass if you told me you’d stay.
Moony: It’s okay. I feel like it wouldn’t taste the same, hadn’t I drunk it from this paper cup.
Sirius: Can I get you anything else?
Moony: No, thanks. I’d better go. It was really nice.
Sirius: You too, Moony."
5,7945231,Sirius,Moony,"Sirius: Can I get you anything else? *fumbling with small packet of sugar between his fingers*
Moony: No, thanks. *sounds a bit lost for a moment* I'd better go. It was really nice. *turns around and walks away*
Sirius: You too, Moony. *Moony flashes him a surprised but heart-warming smile*
Pete: Queers.
Sirius: Shut up, ace. *rolls his eyes* Also, who said he was queer?
Pete: Erm, his body language, style and that he was checking you out all morning?
Sirius: Was he actually? *asks back with a surprised grin* Oh, man, if only- *his eyes wander over the abandoned table and grow wide* Wait, he left his notebook here!
Sirius: Pete, Moony left his notebook here.
Pete: I see. *nods* What's in it?
Sirius: I dunno, I mean- *eyes it carefully* Am I allowed to?
Pete: It's just a sketchbook, mate. *grins* You want me to open it for you?
Sirius: No, weirdo, don't look at his art. *tells him in a possessive voice* Not before I do, anyway.
Sirius: Oh my god. *blurt out* His hair looks like the artist really took his time to create it, the perfect curls he didn't manage to tuck into his manbun. His jaw, his cheekbones, his eyes... he has never seen himself this beautiful before.
Sirius: The name Padfoot is written in pretty cursive at the bottom of the picture. Padfoot. Is that a nickname Moony gave him? Sounds fitting, Sirius decides.
Sirius: Not bad. *shuts the sketchbook* Not bad? It's literally the best art I've ever seen.
Pete: Not even a bit partial there, are we? *chuckles to himself* Will you give it back or just keep it for your shrine?
Sirius: You're creepy. *looks at him as if the idea hadn't occurred to him at all* No, I'll- I mean, you can give it back to him. I'm not working tomorrow.
Pete: Well, then he won't come tomorrow.
Sirius: What do you mean? *frowns*
Pete: He only ever comes when you are in, you inobservant fudge."
6,7945231,Sirius,Peter,"Sirius: I want to talk to you. *watching the telly upside down*
Peter: Well, then he won't come tomorrow. *shrugs*
Sirius: What do you mean? *frowns*
Peter: He only ever comes when you are in, you inobservant fudge.
Sirius: *turns to lie on his back* He has been thinking about visiting The Marauders.
Sirius: *picks up the phone* Hey.
James: Wow, you're fast.
Sirius: Oh, it's you.
James: Why, what did you think?
Sirius: I dunno, mate.
Sirius: *turns back on his stomach* Friday was bad enough and tomorrow we have the morning shift, you know.
James: Since when do you care abou- oh.
Sirius: Be so kind and get off me.
James: I know you want to be well-rested and beautiful tomorrow morning.
Sirius: I'm gonna hang up now.
Sirius: Good morning!
James: I hate you.
Sirius: I'm protesting! If you hit me, hit me with force.
James: Piss off, twat.
Sirius: You and Lily had fun last night?
James: You're jealous, aren't you?
Sirius: Just asking because you showed up almost an hour late.
James: Crap. Does Pete know?
Sirius: Come on, the lad's good, but not that good."
7,7945231,Sirius,James,"Sirius: Crap, *he moans, turning to look at the clock on the wall.* Does Pete know?
Sirius: Come on, *Sirius grabs a sponge and starts cleaning the coffee machine.* The lad's good, but not that good.
James: *nods and leans against the counter, his head hanging low.* And what was Loverboy like today?
Sirius: *replies, not looking up.* He wasn't.
James: What?
Sirius: He's not come this morning.
James: Well, I guess he's realized the worth of sleeping in. *jokes* Hey, I'm sure he'll come by.
Sirius: *drops his sponge in the sink.* Yeah. Also... you know the sketchbook he always carries around?
James: Yeah, why?
Sirius: When he came on Saturday, he left it here. *gives James a small smile.*
James: What? *breaks into a grin.* Show me.
Sirius: *carefully places the notebook down on the counter.* Okay, so anything you see in there, you don't have the right to judge him. Or me. Deal?
James: Oh, god, what's in there? *beams* Shut up and promise me!
Sirius: Yeah, okay, cross my heart and all that. *rolls his eyes.* Now give it to me!
James: *opens it and the long-haired barista watches his face.* Oh my god, he's made a drawing of you! *giggles* This is the cutest thing I've ever seen. And also, *looks at the page more carefully,* did he just give you a nickname?
Sirius: *looks down at his feet, smiling like an idiot.* Yeah, I guess.
James: *grinning at his blushing cheeks.* You look much prettier here than in real life.
Sirius: *huffs, punching his arm.* I'm beautiful. Look at the next page, though.
James: *turns the page, his jaw drops.* Jesus, you two are definitely getting together. *closes the sketchbook, handing it back to Sirius.*
Sirius: *looks up from his phone with a bored expression.* Hey.
Moony: *looks at him with his usual shy smile and holds...*"
8,7945231,Sirius,Moony,"Sirius: Hey, *smiles at the boy who steps in*
Moony: *looks at Sirius with his usual shy smile and holds the door open*
Sirius: Oh.
Girl: Hello! *follows Moony*
Sirius: *frowns* He has no idea who she can be. Sister? No, Moony has no sister. Best friend? Most likely. Girlfriend…?
Girl: *hops to the counter and stands in front of it with an expectant smile*
Sirius: *smiles back politely*
Moony: Hi, *greets Sirius finally* How are you?
Sirius: I’m- I’m okay, really, cool. And you?
Moony: I’m fine, thank you. It will be the usual for me. Dora?
Girl: Stop calling me that, dumbo, *frowns and punches Moony in the arm* I told Mum not to call me that either. Sounds lame.
Moony: Okay, Nymphadora, choose, please.
Girl: I really hate you sometimes, Lupin, *looks at Sirius with a scandalized expression*
Sirius: *swallows* Lupin. His surname is Lupin.
Moony: Alright, Tonks, just choose something, *laughs at her*
Sirius: *realizes he has never heard Moony laugh properly before*
Girl: The same for me as for him, *chirps too loudly* He always goes on about how amazing it is so I wanna give it a try.
Sirius: *asks Moony with a lifted eyebrow and a lopsided smile* You do?
Moony: No, Dora just likes to talk about things she doesn’t know, *replies with a slight blush on his cheeks*
Girl: In your position, I wouldn’t be so cheeky, *smirks at Moony*
Sirius: *turns around and starts scooping sugar in paper cups*
Sirius: *realizes both Moony and Tonks are looking at him*
Sirius: *grabs his Sharpie and scribbles down a line on one of the cups* Aren't your legs tired? Just because you've been running around my mind all day.
Sirius: *places the cups down in front of them* No, the other one is yours, that’s for Moony. Please, *motioning between them*
Girl: *grins brightly and hands the cup to Moony*
Moony: *smiles shyly and doesn’t read it, just as usual*
Moony: *pays for both lattes and is ready to leave*
Sirius: Hey, wait a moment,"
9,7945231,Sirius,Lupin,"Sirius: No, the other one is yours, that's for Moony. Please, *motioning between them.*
Lupin: *grins brightly and hands it over.*
Lupin: Oh, I've been looking for it for ages but I thought I left it on the campus, *smiles thankfully as he takes it.*
Sirius: You left it here last week, I thought- *shrugs.* I really like your art style, by the way.
Lupin: Thank you, *still a bit flushed but looks satisfied.*
Lupin: See you, Padfoot.
Moony: Hey, *speaks, worry in his tired eyes.* Are you guys closing already, or...?
Sirius: We're not, *smiles at him.*
Sirius: Man, are you okay?
Lupin: Yeah, yeah, *nods, tiredly smiling.* I just- can't really sleep?
Sirius: It's quite funny, you know. We should get you a new nickname, then, *says with a wink.*
Sirius: What can I do for you, pretty boy? *blatantly flirting.*
Sirius: Okay, then I make you a nice warm tea, *decides.* It's on the house, *hands him the box of tea.* Choose.
Lupin: *smiles weakly and picks out the first bag he touches.* Just sit down, I'll take it out."
10,7945231,Sirius,Moony,"Sirius: I do, of course, but I-
Sirius: Then I'll make you tea. It's on the house. *hands him the box of tea* Choose.
Moony: *smiles weakly* *picks out the first bag he touches* *hands it over to Sirius*
Sirius: Just sit down, I'll take it out. *fills the kettle*
Sirius: *steals glances at Moony* *smiles*
Sirius: Here you are. *stops next to Moony with a tray of things* It was a last minute idea, the muffin. *places the napkin down in front of Moony* You're like a pizza. Even when you're bad, you're good.
Moony: *glances up at Sirius* So it was chocolate!
Sirius: Yeah, it's my secret ingredient. *smiles proudly* Well, not a secret anymore. I guess I'll have to kill you now. *jokes*
Moony: *laughs*
Moony: Thank you for the tea. I'll pay for it next time, I just really didn't count on this.
Sirius: You really don't understand 'on the house', do you? *chuckles* I've planned on buying you a drink for a while now anyway. And you've left so much tip here I can't even count it. It's the least I can do.
Moony: *smiles playfully* Buying me a drink?
Sirius: I- I mean, only if you want to. *puts up a hand* I dunno what your girlfriend would say because you two are clearly a nice couple and I think she's head over heels because have you seen the way she looks at-
Moony: Padfoot.
Sirius: What?
Moony: You're rambling.
Sirius: Shit. Sorry.
Sirius: I guess I should leave you alone now. *mutters*
Moony: *touches Sirius's wrist gently* No, you can stay. *offers quietly*
Sirius: Why would you want me to?
Moony: Well, first of all because I'm not dating Dora.
Sirius: You're not?"
11,7945231,Sirius,Moony,"Sirius: You're not? *hopes his face is not giving away how relieved he suddenly feels* But- I mean, she looks like she's totally in love with you.
Moony: I hope not, *speaks jokingly* She's way too young... and I'm way too gay.
Sirius: *huge grin appearing on his face* It's- nothing, it's nothing.
Moony: Oh my god, Prongs was right, *eyeing Sirius with amazement*.
Sirius: About- wait, why do you call him Prongs?
Moony: You're so oblivious, *shakes his head, chuckling*.
Sirius: What do you mean?
Moony: Come on, do you really believe I was at the club because I like that kind of music? *asks with a clever smile* Or that I coincidentally always wander in when it's your shift? Or that I left my sketchbook here accidentally? I even gave you a bloody nickname, *laughs*.
Sirius: *speechless; his jaw has literally dropped* You and James have been-
Moony: Working together behind your back? Yes, *stands up, smiling at Sirius* You're not upset, are you?
Sirius: No, I'm just- you could have told me! *demands*.
Moony: Yeah, because telling strangers you fell for their first smile is something that turns out well most of the time, isn't it? *asks, stepping closer to Sirius*.
Sirius: We- we're hardly strangers, *says in a low voice*.
Moony: *smiles down at Sirius* I don't even know your name.
Sirius: *offers* You tell me yours, I tell you mine.
Moony: *looks at him with an adorable small lopsided smile*"
