0,8125531,Harry Potter,Minerva McGonagall,"Harry Potter: It's good to be home.
Minerva McGonagall: To my office? Or would you rather see the repairs we've done to the school?
Harry Potter: I think I'd prefer no one knew I was here. At least for the time being. So maybe I can tour the school after term ends.
Minerva McGonagall: A wise choice. You've created something of a stir, I must say, Mr. Potter. Disappearing again after the war like that. That horrible Skeeter woman has had quite a field day with speculation, though I dare say, no one believed her more wild conjectures.
Harry Potter: *laughs*"
1,8125531,Harry Potter,McGonagall,"Harry: You’ve created something of a stir, I must say, Mr. Potter. Disappearing again after the war like that. That horrible Skeeter woman has had quite a field day with speculation, though I dare say, no one believed her more wild conjectures.
McGonagall: A wise choice, and, taking his arm, began guiding him to her office. I hardly keep up on the latest gossip, McGonagall said, sternly.
Harry: Oh, sorry, then, Harry said, clearly not meaning a word of it.
McGonagall: But Molly Weasley does, and she has been sure to tell me all about it, she continued. I believe the latest theory is that you have abandoned all obligations to magical Britain in pursuit of a scandalous relationship with an American witch, supported on the evidence of a single photo of you in New York city.
Harry: I thought that was a magical camera flash, but I wasn’t sure.
McGonagall: Now the Quibbler, which I do subscribe to, has been publishing some very entertaining rebuttals to these pieces. According to Miss Lovegood, you have renounced the title of Chosen One and are sequestered somewhere in the American Midwest, learning the ancient secrets of wandless magic and forming an entirely new branch of magic.
Harry: I can always count on Luna to make me sound far more interesting than I actually am, Harry said fondly. And she did know where I was.
McGonagall: Where have you been? McGonagall asked, unable to entirely suppress her curiosity.
Harry: After the year with the ministry rounding up the last of the Death Eaters? I’ve been traveling. Spent some time in France for a while, and then on to Bulgaria and stayed with Victor Krum, you remember him. Learned some right nasty curses there that might have been useful, once upon a time. She hears rather than sees the wry smile in his words. Then six months in the States, with a muggle friend of Hermione’s family. No one knew me there, that was nice, and out west there are some remnants of pre-colonial magic to be found still. More so I heard in South America, but I didn’t make it there. And so on. Popping back across to see Teddy, of course, but he has his Gran, and Molly has practically adopted him—all of the Weasleys have really. Finished up with a stint in the Netherlands, funding some promising werewolf research, but mostly just thinking.
McGonagall: And now you’re back, she said.
Harry: And now I’m back.
McGonagall: You understand, Professor, Harry began, after a moment, that I don’t have my N.E.W.T.s. I never even finished seventh year. Between everything, I never had a chance the first time around, and then afterwards there didn’t seem to be much point. Hermione argued for it, of course, but I was so tired of Britain. So technically, I am completely unqualified for the position.
McGonagall: Quite a way to begin an interview, Mr. Potter, McGonagall said."
2,8125531,McGonagall,Harry,"McGonagall: I hardly think it’s necessary for me to recap all the mad things you and your friends got up to during your time at Hogwarts, but I will take a moment to remind you that you began your Hogwarts career as the eleven year old who defeated a mountain troll.
Harry: You know, I had almost forgotten about that.

McGonagall: Regardless of the status of your N.E.W.T.s, the lack of which I find perfectly understandable, there is no question that you are entirely overqualified to teach Defense Against the Dark Arts this coming academic year and for as many following years as you would like. I, in fact, have only one question for you.
Harry: Ask.

McGonagall: Why, Mr. Potter? You could have anything, be anything that you want. If you ran for Minister for Magic tomorrow, I feel quite sure you could win. Why come back here?
Harry: Professor, I’m tired. It has been three years, almost to the day since I defeated Voldemort, and I am still—I never asked for any of it: I only ever did what I didn’t have a choice but to do. I bought back my parent’s house in Godric’s Hollow, did you know? Fixed it up again after some photos I found. And some part of me wants to hide in there and never come out again, bury myself in the past. But, it does not do to dwell on dreams, especially dark ones. Let Hermione or Ron or, or Percy become Minister for Magic. Hogwarts is the only home I have ever known, and there are people here who need me but won’t ask anything of me I can’t do. And that, for me, is terribly rare.

McGonagall: Hogwarts will always be here for you, as long as you will have it, Mr. Potter."
3,8125531,McGonagall,Harry,"McGonagall: Welcome back to Hogwarts. And welcome to Hogwarts to you too, Mr. Lupin, *bending to speak to Teddy.*
Harry: Someone's feeling a little shy. It's been a big day for the little tyke. First side along apparation. First time seeing Hogwarts. We saw the giant squid sunning itself. And he's practicing controlling his hair color.
Teddy: Yeah, look! 'm Harry now.
McGonagall: Very good!
Teddy: But I like pink.
Harry: He takes after his mother."
4,8125531,McGonagall,Harry,"McGonagall: Welcome, she began, to all the new first years, as well as to all our returning students. I will keep this brief, as I’m sure everyone is anxious to begin eating and full of summer gossip to tell their friends or legends to scare the first years, laughter at this, but first some announcements.
McGonagall: First, following the incidents last April, we ask that students do NOT bait Peeves the Poltergeist or attempt exorcisms against him. He may be a nuisance, but he has rendered services to this school that merit his placement here. Calling to Mr. Filch that you are out past curfew does not void that. A pointed look at some sheepish Slytherin fourth years.
McGonagall: Second, the arithmancy section of the library has now been fully repaired and students are once again allowed to check out books, although Madam Pince warns that the northernmost end of the transfiguration shelves remains somewhat unstable, especially around the half moon, and recommends that students who intend to get books from that area inform her and at least two separate friends beforehand. Third, as always, the Forbidden Forest remains entirely off limits except on excursions led by a professor. Those of you wishing to visit the centaur Firenze for extra-divination lessons are no exception. Professor Trelawney will be leading chaperoned expeditions twice a month. You may speak with her for further details. She paused a moment, taking a proper breath in.
McGonagall: Finally, I am very pleased to announce that we have with us a new professor of Defense Against the Dark Arts, although I expect most of you already know this, Professor Potter.
Harry: *passing food to his godson under the invisibility cloak.*
McGonagall: As McGonagall sat in her office the next day during the start of classes, she insisted to herself that it wasn’t immoral, per se, to listen in on one of her new professor’s lessons. If anything, it was prudent, and maybe if Dumbledore had done so he would have noticed that Moody had been replaced by an imposter, or that Lockhart was a fraud, or that Quirrel had Voldemort living on the back of his head. Not that McGonagall suspected any of that of Harry, but, well, she was curious, and there were wards that let her check in on any room in Hogwarts. So technically, yes, she was spying on Harry’s lessons, but it wasn't wrong.
McGonagall: She felt uneasily like this was exactly the kind of thing Dumbledore would have approved of, but when she glanced at his portrait on the wall he appeared fast asleep. She conjured a shivering image of the Defense Against the Dark Arts classroom before her.
McGonagall: Harry’s first class was at quarter to ten and a mix of Slytherin and Gyffindor fifth years. They would have been too young to have stayed and fought at the Battle of Hogwarts, but many of them would have seen it begin. Five minutes before class, they filed in, whispering to each other behind their hands, and Harry, sitting at his desk, checking over lessons plans, pretended not to notice."
5,8125531,Harry,Gryffindor student,"Harry: There’s a funny thing I noticed back when I was in school. See, they put the Slytherins and the Gryffindors together in class, but the Slytherins always sit together and the Gryffindors always sit together, so why bother?
Harry: Everyone please stand up. I’d like all Gryffindors to go to the left side of the room please, and all the Slytherins on the right.
Harry: All right then, you please, yes, you, Ms. Burke, to this desk please. And you please, Ms. Montague, next to her, thank you.
Harry: These are to be your seats for at least the next month, please. After that, if you find you still absolutely can’t stand the people you are sitting next to, you may change. At the very least, this should cut down on the mysterious whispering problem we seemed to have had as you all came in, although if we’re lucky you’ll make friends with your new seatmates and that whispering problem will come back.
Gryffindor student: But Ha- Professor? Why?
Harry: Because, Mr. Xin, house prejudices are dangerous things. They are dangerous when we make friends only with people of our own houses, and they are dangerous when we blame problems on people of other houses.
Harry: But your house does not define you. The most cowardly man I ever knew was a Gryffindor, and I have seen Slytherins do braver things than any Gryffindor. That said, any prejudiced talk from anyone in this classroom will not be tolerated. Prejudice against other houses, prejudice against Muggleborns, prejudice against magical creatures. If I hear it, if I hear of it, there will be swift consequences.
Harry: Anyway, I understand that your magical education in this as in most other subjects has been badly interrupted, but I’m glad that you have at least three years of defense training by now. More than I could say for myself, *Harry said with a grin*. I intend to spend this year with you talking about magical strategy and introduction to dueling. Because I am not sure of your background, we will also..."
6,8125531,Neville,Teddy,"Neville: I'm sorry Teddy, you shouldn't have been playing where you shouldn't have been.
McGonagall: *watching Neville and Teddy* Neville took him back gratefully, apologizing profusely and scolding Teddy for playing where he shouldn’t have been. Teddy looked less than remorseful though, and a small part of McGonagall gave it up for a lost cause. *McGonagall left them, walking slowly back to her office and contemplating the spell that had been activated.*

McGonagall: It was strange because, to start, the castle had told her about the remaining traps. Of course, the castle believed that a little danger and peril was healthy for growing witches and wizards, but after the battle, it had told her the locations of traps. Peeves had gone through the corridors, deactivating them where he could and simply springing them when he couldn’t, so they could be dealt with properly, and she knew they had gone over the corridor where Teddy had been playing at least twice because it was close enough to the Gryffindor tower that there were bound to be students sneaking out past it at all hours."
7,8125531,Harry,Dumbledore,"Harry: “- ever think for just a moment that I had a right to know?”
Dumbledore: “Harry,”
Harry: “You sat up here in your high tower, and you organized everything as you saw fit! Did you ever care how anyone else felt about it?”
Dumbledore: “It was war,”
Harry: “You thought you were the only one capable of making decisions that affected everyone!”
Dumbledore: “Who else would have stood up to do it?”
Harry: “How many plans?”
Harry: “How many plans and back up plans and back up, back up plans did you have in place so in the end I would walk into that damn forest and die?”
Harry: “Bullocks!”
Harry: “You knew nothing! You guessed, and you schemed, and you hoped, and you prayed because you were guilty over something I never had a part in. You raised me like the damn sacrificial lamb, and just think of all the people who had to die for your guess to work out, for me to stand back up and—”
Harry: “We were just children.”
McGonagall: “Harry,”
Harry: *sobs into McGonagall's shoulder*
McGonagall: “You know, I think James would have also stuck you to the ceiling as a diversion to sneak into this office. I know Sirius...”"
8,8125531,Harry,McGonagall,"Harry: Certainly not, Professor Potter, *flitted around the edges of his mouth as he struggled to keep a straight face.*
McGonagall: Though if you think you are teaching chess you’re sorely mistaken. He’ll have you in three moves.
Harry: *looked back at the board, puzzled*
Anthony: Merlin’s ba- Merlin, *Harry swore, remembering just in time the first and second years in the room.* You’re right. Well, if you’re not busy, do you want to take over for me?
McGonagall: *surprised at the invitation, but really having nothing better to do, she didn’t see any reason to decline.*
Harry: Good! *standing and brushing himself off.* Because Nigel, *a sixth year muggleborn in the corner,* is something called a Dungeon Master, and he promised to teach us.
McGonagall: *raised an eyebrow.* What is a Dungeon Master? she asked.
Harry: I have no idea! *Harry said.* That’s why Nigel is going to teach us.
Henry: *had placed the board on a desk and was silently replacing the pieces.* A game, Professor? *he asked.*
McGonagall: *With a last skeptical look at Harry, McGonagall acquiesced and sat down to play.*
Harry: There’s been a change of plans, *he said, evasively.* I’m just working out some details.
McGonagall: Details on what, Mr. Potter? *McGonagall asked, using her best headmistress voice.*
Harry: *A pause stretched out while Harry tried and failed to keep from looking smug.* Transportation.
McGonagall: To where? If I may ask.
Harry: Godric’s hollow, *Harry admitted.* Andromeda, Teddy, and everyone are going to meet us there. At my parent’s house.
McGonagall: *McGonagall waited for more details, which, after a moment, Harry volunteered.* I invited all the students who were staying here for the holidays. Hogwarts is great and all but, well it’s not the same as having a family for Christmas. And it seemed a shame to interrupt our D&D sessions.
Harry: Yes, well, some of the muggleborn parents are understandably a little concerned at their children taking magical transportation like that, and Nigel himself is terrified of them, something about the Star Trek transporter problem. So while a portkey will do it for most of them, I’m just working out some last minute details for the rest.
McGonagall: Perhaps, *she said after a long moment,* I might be persuaded to let you borrow some of the school brooms. Provided, of course, *she said, giving him a pointed look,* younger students are accompanied by older more experienced flyers.
Harry: *grinned,* Can’t be more dangerous than flying thestrals to invade the Ministry, can it?
McGonagall: If that is the reference you insist on measuring things against, I’m afraid we may have a professional disagreement on the meaning of danger. *Harry laughed and McGonagall added archly,* And I, Mr. Potter, outrank you."
9,8125531,Harry,A,"Harry: I want to talk to you, A walked towards B, It's urgent!
McGonagall: And I, Mr. Potter, outrank you.
Hermione: The Prime Minister of Romania has an uncle who is a wizard, actually, but apparently no one got around to telling the current president about the existence of magic, so that’s giving us quite a bit of trouble. We know for a fact that there’s a group of at least five Death Eaters holed up in Bucharest, but we can’t get at them.
Ron: You’ll get them. It’s just bureaucracy.
Neville: How’s S.P.E.W. going?
Hermione: It’s not called that anymore. Well, I did manage to convince Regulation and Control to draft a protection act. It’s not emancipation, but it’s regulation and that’s a start.
Harry: Not just leaving random socks hidden all around Britain?
Ginny: So, do you think you’ll keep Harry on another year? Or is he sacked for being a terrible influence.
McGonagall: I think Harry can stay. Although it was looking somewhat iffy a couple weeks ago when two second years managed to hex each other three separate times in the same class.
Harry: To be fair, Angela’s mother’s hearing got pushed up, so she was having a rough week.
Neville: Harry, detention with you usually means chocolate and a chance to ask questions about the war. Students try to get detention with you.
Harry: At least the questions I..."
10,8125531,McGonagall,Longbottom,"McGonagall: Mr. Longbottom, if you have given a first year girl gillyweed I can personally guarantee that you will never become a professor at Hogwarts.
Harry: Is that really any worse than buying a first year a broom?
McGonagall: That was for Quidditch and is an entirely different matter.
Ginny: *seconded the idea*
Hermione: *professed to still completely fail to understand the appeal of the sport*
McGonagall: *let them continue, secure and content in a tower of Hogwarts, high above the rest of the world.*

McGonagall: Miss Junipers, has Professor Potter told you why you are here?
Calypso: *shook her head while wearing absolutely the guiltiest look McGonagall had ever seen on a student*
Harry: *rolled his eyes*
McGonagall: This morning, Kreacher informed him that a Hufflepuff student had slipped into the kitchen and attempted to bribe the house elves to slip this into his drink. Professor Potter recognized it as a love potion and brought the matter to my attention. Does any of this sound familiar to you?
Calypso: It wasn’t me Professor! I’m rubbish at potions!
McGonagall: Miss Junipers, love potions can be bought. This one originates from an order service called Madame Monette’s Amorous Solutions.
Calypso: I’ve never even heard of that!
McGonagall: Additionally, it is entirely possible to determine who a love potion is intended to make the target fall in love with, without having to actually drink it.
Calypso: *looked panicked, aware that she was well and truly caught in the act*
Calypso: I’m so, so sorry Professor! It was—well someone sne"
11,8125531,Calypso,Harry,"Calypso: I’m so, so sorry Professor! It was—well someone sneaked some firewhiskey into the Hufflepuff common room for Andrea’s birthday, and things got a little out of a hand, and it was a dare, and I’m so sorry!
Harry: I’m afraid your fate isn’t in my hands.
McGonagall: Do you understand how serious an offense this is?
Calypso: No! I want to be a healer at St. Mungo’s! If I get a record, they’ll never take me!
Calypso: Are you really going to tell the ministry? Will they even let me take my N.E.W.T.s after this?
McGonagall: Miss Junipers, you are very lucky in that Professor Potter has requested that we be lenient on you, given that in your years at Hogwarts this has been your first offense.
Calypso: With Professor Potter?
McGonagall: No, Miss Junipers. With Professor Slughorn.
Calypso: Yes, Professor.
Calypso: *leaves with a last longing glance at the love potion and then at Harry*
Harry: *bursts out laughing*
McGonagall: I don’t think it’s particularly funny.
Harry: Bit of well-founded paranoia: I always check my drinks first. I would have been fine. Besides, Ginny’s well stocked on antidotes to love potions.
Harry: But the principle of the thing remains. We can’t have students attempting to dose you.
Harry: But I’m only a few years older than some of these students, and I am the hero of the wizarding world.
Snape's portrait: As always, glad to see it hasn’t gone to your head, Potter.
Harry: I mean, That I’m sure it will blow over within a few years, and until then I have the entire fleet of house elves on my side.
McGonagall: I really don’t know why they still allow these.
Harry: They’ve been banned at Hogwarts for forty years.
Harry: Oh, well, when has the wizarding world ever been progressive on anything?
McGonagall: I’m considering banning Madame Monette’s altogether.
Harry: Replace all their subscriptions with Quibbler subscriptions. Luna would be able to afford another trip."
12,8125531,Harry,McGonagall,"Harry: Isn’t there anything you can do to stop the girls from falling all over you?”
McGonagall: Why do you think I wear all the ridiculous sweaters?” Harry asked. “I wouldn’t mind if they were just quiet about it like they are with Neville.” He got a sudden thoughtful look. “I could have Ginny threaten to hex them all.”

McGonagall: Are you looking forward to summer holidays, Professor Potter?” she asked.
Harry: Yeah, Andromeda agreed to let Teddy get a broom that flies more than a foot off the ground so Ginny and I are going to teach him Quidditch. Then for my birthday Luna has promised some sort of surprise, and I have no idea what it is but knowing her it will be worth it.
McGonagall: And your gaming group?
Harry: Worked that out ago months ago. He rattled off a list of who was going where and finished up by saying, “Everyone is going somewhere where they are happy, and they have all promised to write.
McGonagall: Well, then you seem to have everything quite under control.
Harry: So, the reason I have asked you here.
Harry: I’m not getting the sack, am I?
McGonagall: Don’t be ridiculous, Potter.
Harry: Just checking.
McGonagall: I just want to ask you how you are.
Harry: If this is a ‘check on Harry, make sure he’s okay’ talk, I get those weekly from Andromeda and daily from Molly, he warned."
13,8125531,Harry,McGonagall,"Harry: “I’m not getting the sack, am I?”
McGonagall: “Don’t be ridiculous, Potter.”
Harry: “Just checking.”
McGonagall: “I just want to ask you how you are.”
Harry: “If this is a ‘check on Harry, make sure he’s okay’ talk, I get those weekly from Andromeda and daily from Molly.”
McGonagall: “As your employer, and as your friend, I want to ask how you are and whether working at Hogwarts has done what you hoped.”
Harry: *went quiet for a long moment, looking out a window across the grounds of Hogwarts where the last, long rays of the sunset reflected off the lake. Distantly, Dumbledore’s tomb gleamed white and gold.*
Harry: “The real reason I made the Gryffindors mix with the Slytherins in my class was because I don’t care anymore what side of the war your parents were on. I just don’t want any more kids to die.”
Harry: “Anyway, Meredith Burke and Allison Montague have a summer trip to France planned together. They’re doing half wizarding things and half muggle things. In the dueling club, two third years showed up last month and were able to pull off fully formed, if somewhat shaky, Patronuses. Henry, who comes from a mix of about twelve different pureblood families, is spending a couple weeks with Nigel’s family this summer.”
McGonagall: “Yes, but Harry, how are you?”
Harry: “That’s what I’m saying. All these kids, I did that. I made that possible. So you have Gryffindors spending their summers with Slytherins, and purebloods staying at muggle homes, and what it all means is—”
Harry: *paused and took a breath, trying vainly to flatten his hair back out.*
Harry: “The war is actually, finally over. Properly. And I’m not off running away across the world anymore. I’m here. With a job to do. Where it began, and where it ended, and it did end. It really is over.” *He laughed, a slight sound of overdue relief.*
McGonagall: *understood.* “Good.”
Harry: *They looked at each other across the desk for a long breath, and then he said, “I expect any edits to your curriculum for next year by mid-July please. That’s all then. Go finish preparing your exam, Potter.”
Harry: *stood, but waited a moment before leaving. He leaned down and put a hand over McGonagall’s.* “I don’t know if I ever said thank you, Professor.”
McGonagall: *smiled at him.* “You never had to.”
Harry: *walked out and let the door fall to behind him. There were murmurings from the headmasters on the walls.*
Phineas Black: “He’s too young to be a professor. He’s too soft on the students.”
Dumbledore’s portrait: “You’ve done well by him, Minerva.”
McGonagall: “I think he’s done well by all of us.”
McGonagall: *watched the door for a while, thinking, and then said, “He’s right, isn’t he? The war is over for good this time. There’s no last minute plot to revive Voldemort, there’s no new Dark Lord, no secret heir?”*
Dumbledore’s portrait: *twinkled in that strange, disarming way.* “No. When Harry defeated Voldemort four years ago, he defeated him for good, with a magic older and stronger than…”"
14,8125531,Harry,Voldemort,"Harry: He’s right, isn’t he? The war is over for good this time. There’s no last minute plot to revive Voldemort, there’s no new Dark Lord, no secret heir?
Dumbledore: No. When Harry defeated Voldemort four years ago, he defeated him for good, with a magic older and stronger than anything Voldemort ever wielded. I cannot tell you if another dark wizard will rise to power; there will always be those who seek to rule over other men and be called lord, but I think if they come they will not find it as easy to gain power as they once did. Harry is healing very old wounds.
McGonagall: He gets to be happy now. He deserves that.
Harry: It’s strange for the end of the year to come without having to fight any evil.
McGonagall: Have a good summer, Harry."
