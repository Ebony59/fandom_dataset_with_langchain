0,8243507,Hermione,Miranda,"Hermione: Do not. Let it get to you.
Miranda: *understanding Hermione's advice* It killed Miranda that she could do nothing for Hermione, that she was named as the cause of Hermione’s oppression in some way.
Matt: We’re a bit early. Let’s find a bench, shall we?
Miranda: Good idea!
Matt: *pushing the cart* He was of half a mind to remove Hermione from this school and find her magical tutors so that she could be at home, amid people who loved her in her totality.
Miranda: *thinking about researching Hermione's alternatives* Her child was in pain and suffering. To do everything she could to stop it was her only goal.
Miranda: *thinking about writing to McGonagall* What did people think, that just because her daughter had entered a society that was closed to her that Miranda had ceased to be a mother?
Miranda: *thinking about Hermione's letters* Her daughter’s letters had slowly changed this position, and helped her to stand down.
Miranda: *thinking about Hermione's friends* Miranda was glad to know that she did have other friends in other houses, such as a casual friendship with Susan Bones.
Miranda: *thinking about the Weasley twins* She also was secretly very fond of the Weasley twins.
Hermione: *in a letter* Yesterday, when I was studying, and Harry and Ron were outside playing pickup quidditch, Fred and George taught me a few third year spells they’re learning.
Miranda: *reading Hermione's letters* Hermione’s letters were slowly filled, not only of schoolwork and her cultural observations, but of experiences.
Miranda: *seeing Draco Malfoy* He bullied Hermione, that much she knew, even if Hermione had not said as much.
Miranda: *observing Draco's mother* She didn’t seem evil, just an absentee mother.
Miranda: *observing Draco's father* His single glance made Miranda’s skin crawl. He had the eyes of a rapist, the eyes of a murderer, who lived to watch his victims die slowly in agony.
Miranda: *thinking about protecting Hermione* If that Mr. Malfoy ever took one towards Hermione, Miranda would disarticulate him, slowly, and without anesthetic, moving so slowly that his magic would begin to heal him just before she made a deeper, longer, firmer, slice into his body, moving incrementally over his skin, making scars of scars of scars, just as his child had done to hers."
1,8243507,Miranda,Hermione,"Miranda: Hermione, there's your friends, the We—
Hermione: Mum! Shh!

Miranda: *watching keenly, her eyes sharp*
Hermione: *absorbed in her book*

Miranda: *sharing a knowing look with Matt*
Matt: *looking bemused*

Twin 1: Ron, Ginny! Mum needs your help!
Miranda: *keeping her gaze light*
Hermione: *freezing slightly, then exhaling intentionally and letting her eyes fall back on the page*
Matt: *looking faintly amused*

Miranda: *reminding Matt to watch the conversation play out*
Matt: *nodding in agreement*

Twin 1: *pasting on a look of surprise*"
2,8243507,Miranda,Hermione,"Miranda: Oh, hey, ’Mione.
Hermione: Hello, Fred.
Fred: Actually, I’m George.
Hermione: Sure you are, Fred.
Fred: Only joking, I… How did you know?
Hermione: Regrettably, no.
Matt: Why don’t you ask her on the train?
Mrs. Weasley: George, you’re going to miss the train!
Mrs. Weasley: Sorry, Fred! Come on, then!
Miranda: Did you see that? Did you? Oh my God, Matt!
Matt: I think you’re awfully excited over a tiny crush on her best friend’s older brother. It’s likely to fizzle and become an awkward teenage memory.
Miranda: Hermione was exploring the world, making friends, making memories, doing things that she would laugh about decades later, in the company of others who had been there with her. Hermione had found her tribe.
Miranda: So…"
3,8243507,Miranda,Hermione,"Miranda: So... Tell me more about the project you're working on with Fred. *walking through King's Cross*
Hermione: Well, it's actually George and Fred. *explaining their project* But anyway...
Hermione: What's going on, Mum?
Miranda: Nothing, nothing. *glad to have her daughter for this conversation* I was thinking that if you wanted to have friends round one of these term breaks, that you might consider extending an invitation to Fre—er, the twins.
Hermione: I don't think his parents will let that happen. *tense expression* There's a lot going on that I can't explain.
Miranda: Well, they can hardly object to a family dinner. Why don't you let me arrange something with Mrs. Weasley.
Hermione: I... Fine. But I swear, Mum, I will hex you if you give into your delusions in front of Molly. A more marriage-minded woman you'll never meet, though I do love her.
Fred: *trying to slip away unnoticed*
Miranda: *pretending not to see or hear* *approaching their bench*
Fred: *greeting Miranda with a shy smile* *chit-chatting with Miranda*
Hermione: *turning the page of her book*
Fred: *stepping behind Hermione* ..."
4,8243507,Fred,Hermione,"Fred: What are you reading?
Hermione: Prtichard’s discussion of the Goblin Rebellion of 1752. It’s really quite fascinating.
Fred: Right, especially the part about how the Goblins ended up throwing their lot in with werewolves, and Gore was elected Minister for Magic because of it. I think that bit’s on pages 679 to 743. If you want to read ahead and check it.
Hermione: I’m done taking book recommendations for you, if you’re just to take my fun and shut it down. You have yet to internalize the point that context is as critical as facts.
Fred: I didn’t recommend any such book. You must be thinking of Forge. And anyway, the point of knowledge is to apply it.
Hermione: You can’t apply it logically unless you have a deeply grounded context in which to develop—
Fred: This argument is so much more efficient on paper. All I am trying to say is that you have to know what other theorists say so that you can develop your own theories.
Hermione: To a point, yes. But if you get caught up in the law of this, or the theorem of that, you start to lose your own voice and your own interpretation of facts.
Fred: You’re not going to know if something is going to work unless you have a firm grounding in theory and history and the applicable discipline.
Hermione: You can’t design an experiment unless you have a literature review, after all.
Fred: You come up with the experiment and then you conduct the review. There is some interpretation.
Hermione: Yes, but you conceptualize an experiment on the basis of preexisting knowledge. And then you write the review, and edit your conceptualization and probable outcomes as you go along.
Fred: Or you could just steal potions ingredients, and conduct clandestine experiments in the girl’s loo. Take a risk, live a little.
Fred: All I’m saying is that you can’t pay attention to the syntax of the thing, sometimes—
Unknown character: And here, ladies and gentleman, we have a rare sighting of Weasley and Granger arguing outside of the library, or more recently, the fourth floor broom cupboard—
Hermione: Funny."
5,8243507,Fred,Hermione,"Fred: And then, before Fred could continue, there was a young man saddling up to Fred, saying in his best announcer’s voice, 'And here, ladies and gentleman, we have a rare sighting of Weasley and Granger arguing outside of the library, or more recently, the fourth floor broom cupboard—'
Hermione: Funny. *puts her book in her backpack, and slung it over her shoulder* I have to go help the Prefects. I said I would. I should have been there ages ago. Mum, meet Lee Jordan.
Miranda: Mrs. Granger, lovely to meet you. *shifts* The broom closet thing, well that’s only because of Peeves. He sounds an alarm when they’re seen together. Your daughter is rather legendary.
Hermione: You have to know the rules to break them most artfully.
Lee: And Granger scores the final goal! Game, set, match, Hermione!
Fred: You’re mixing up your metaphors again. Since when do you play tennis?
Lee: Since I met a muggle girl this summer. I’m very good at tennis now.
Hermione: You charmed your racket, right?
Lee: Well, and her.
Hermione: Bye, Mum!
Lee: That’s what counts, isn’t it, Freddie?
Fred: You’ve lost your mind. Have a good term, Dr. Granger. Thanks for all the muggle records.
Miranda: Fred, do me a favor, would you, and let your Mum know I’d like a chat?
Lee: Well, there’s no time like the present, is there? Bye, Dr. Granger!
Miranda: Bye, Lee! Have a good term, boys! Remember to clean your teeth and check the broom closets for poltergeists before picking one!
Fred: *trips as he walks away*
Lee: *howls with laughter*"
6,8243507,Miranda,George,"Miranda: Actually, I'm George. *winks at Hermione*
Hermione: One day... I just might believe you, Fred, and then what will you do? I should hope you have a plan, here.
Fred: I've always got a plan. Can't tell you what it is, yet.
Hermione: Okay. Should I go over there to Fred and tell him I would be very happy to go to the Yule Ball with him? You know once I give my word, I wouldn't break it, and he did ask in an owl.
Fred: Hermione— *flummoxed*
Hermione: I was only joking!
Fred: Hermione... The whole school, literally, is within earshot and listening.
Hermione: I don't care! Why should I care if the whole school knows? Why should I care if they hear the whole argument? It certainly saves time on the gossip rounds!"
7,8243507,Hermione,Angelina,"Hermione: Why should I care if they hear the whole argument? It certainly saves time on the gossip rounds!
Hermione: Hey, Angelina? Are you hearing this?
Angelina: Yes! Loud and clear, ta!
Fred: You and George annoyed at me...
Hermione: Oh, Fred. If only it were as easy as that. I’m not annoyed. I’m hurt. I asked you to stop that. I asked, and you didn’t. What does that say about us, really?
Fred: Hermione, I only...
Hermione: It’s not a joke, Fred, unless everyone is in on it.
Miranda: Good book, Hermione?
Hermione: Well, why shouldn’t it be? It’s a very interesting book about the gender-integration of Hogwarts. I’ve already found four factual errors in this chapter alone. I’m planning to write the publisher with my corrections when I finish.
Fred: That’s like your Bible. You’ve never said a word against it!
Hermione: As I have said a million times, Fred, my duty is to the truth and to justice. The idea that people would intentionally publish books with glaring errors is beyond me, so I am inclined to be helpful and state the obvious.
Fred: Is that what you call it? Think of the poor little clerk that will read your letter and dissolve into a puddle of tears and wailing. Whatever will they do?"
8,8243507,Hermione,Fred,"Hermione: Is that what you call it? *teased Fred*
Fred: Think of the poor little clerk that will read your letter and dissolve into a puddle of tears and wailing. Whatever will they do?
Hermione: Stating the truth is only logical. *closed her book* Even if it is repetitious and obvious.
Miranda: Ebbinghaus suggests that information becomes memory most effectively by something called spaced repetition, that is repeating a question, or say, a phrase, *tested her assumptions*
Miranda: ...at regular intervals over a period of time increases retention and recall. A recent study suggested that people who commit to learning in this way are 67% more likely to commit that something to memory, to most fully understand it and explore it, and to apply it in their lives.
Fred: Interesting...
Hermione: I'd like to see this study.
Miranda: I'll owl it.
George: I'll keep them in line.
Miranda: I think they've got themselves handled, don't you?
George: Actually, I was more talking about Fred. I still don't think Fred knows what's hit him. It's only been years. Then again, everyone has always said I'm the clever twin.
Miranda: Well, far be it from me to disagree with everyone. Have a great year, George.
George: You know, you're the only person who has optimism for school anymore. It's refreshing.
Hermione: You fight like hell, and you let them steal nothing from you.
Miranda: We're not going until there's no other choice. If, Hermione, if."
9,8243507,Miranda,Hermione,"Miranda: You’re not going to be safe, even in Australia, unless I take every trace of your—
Miranda: We’re not going until there’s no other choice.
Miranda: If, Hermione, if.
Hermione: *nodded*
Miranda: *busied herself with shushing him, and offering a cat treat through the bars as Hermione collected herself*
Miranda: *She did not know when she would see her daughter again. Even now, Sirius told her to be at the ready for evacuation at any moment.*
Miranda: *She knew that keeping her memories was the only way she would survive.*
Hermione: *did not understand, though she might one day, that the ability to remember the war was the only thing that told you had survived on days you felt like you couldn’t go.*
Miranda: *Miranda was startled out of her musings and her melancholy by sound of a pop that was rather like a bubble bursting in her ear.*
Hermione: Fred! You did that just to show off!
Fred: Actually—
Fred: *He sniffed, clearly mocking his estranged brother, Percy.*
Fred: *He looked down at Hermione, making much of their height difference, As the creator of very complex portrays designed for just such travel, I, Miss Granger, am an expert.*
Hermione: You’re a show-off and a flirt.
Fred: You’re the flirt.
Fred: *He looked over at the young children boarding the train.*
Ron: *came bustling over, and greeted both women, adding, Hermione, I’m not going to the meeting alone. Come on.*
Ron: *He took the cat basket from her, calling back, You can argue with Fred later. Preferably when I’m not around.*
Hermione: Apparently I live to torture him.
Fred: He’s used to it.
Miranda: *She wished that Matt was allowed to come, but they were never, never to go in the wizarding world together.*
Miranda: *“Stay safe. Daddy and I are always here, and there’s a beach with your name on it.”*
Hermione: When this is over.
Miranda: *She knew it in her soul.*
Miranda: *“Go.”*
Fred: I promise you, no matter what, she will come to you. She will come back.
Miranda: You both will. You haven’t a choice.
Fred: I can’t promise you that, Miranda. Harry, Ron, and Hermione have to survive. They have to be the ones to win this, and I will do everything to make sure that happens. I can’t tell you"
10,8243507,Miranda,Fred,"Miranda: She will come back.
Miranda: You both will. You haven't a choice.
Fred: I can't promise you that, Miranda.
Fred: Harry, Ron, and Hermione have to survive. They have to be the ones to win this, and I will do everything to make sure that happens.
Miranda: Don't demean what you have by telling me you'd die for her. That's meaningless tripe.
Miranda: You live for the people you love, experience life to the fullest no matter the risks. You live through the tears, you don't die with a smile.
Fred: Miranda...
Fred: I don't know how this war will end, but I promise you, at the end, that you will know I have done everything I could to keep my word and be on this platform.
Miranda: *When the train pulled away, leaving Fred by her side, Miranda had never felt so alone.*
Miranda: *Miranda suspected Fred felt the same way.*

Miranda: You don't have to go, Hermione.
Hermione: I owe it to the people who will never have the chance.
Miranda: I'll expect you home for Saturday tea.
Miranda: You've got to get going, Hermione.
Hermione: *Hermione hesitated.*
Hermione: *Hermione stood, picked up Crooks's basket as she had so many times before, and stepped back.*
Hermione: Fred?
Voice: Don't tell me you were expecting George. I'll leave and go get him, shall I?
Hermione: *Hermione turned so fast she nearly tripped.*"
11,8243507,Hermione,Fred,"Hermione: Fred? *whirling about, a single question on her lips*
Fred: Don’t tell me you were expecting George. I’ll leave and go get him, shall I?
Hermione: *turning fast, nearly tripping* Oi!
Ginny: *calling out from an open window* Watching you two is like watching paint dry! I did not miss your clandestine wartime we—
Neville: *calling out from a window down the carriage* Now is not the time!
Hermione: *eyes filled with tears* Well, I do hope you’ll be blissfully and orgasmically happy together.
Fred: Had to break her heart, though. Bigamy’s illegal. You should look into that when you’re Minister for Magic. Probably doesn’t count if your first wife is a goddess.
Hermione: *rolling her eyes fondly* Right after you tell me why you didn’t say you were coming.
Fred: I was going to surprise you, you know, station in Hogsmeade. But then I remembered that I promised Miranda I’d be here to get on the train. So then I had to get to London, and get through security, and avoid my mother, and devise a suitable entrance.
Hermione: *whispered* Thank you.
Miranda: *laughing and waving* Thank you.
Hermione: *whispered* Thank you.
Fred: *providing a hand onto the train*"
