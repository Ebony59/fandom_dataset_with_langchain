0,830080,Sirius,Remus,"Sirius: This is nuts, *waves his arm at the front facade of Hogwarts* Really? Can we swap? I've cinnamon.
Remus: What?
Sirius: This! Not the sticky bun! *flops down on the steps and puts his face in his hands*
Remus: Oh, come on Padfoot, I'm just teasing. Well, not about the bun, are you sure there's nothing but cinnamon?
Sirius: Bloody Lily Potter and her bloody machinations.
Remus: That's no way to talk about the mother of your future godson. *sits next to Sirius* He offered a bit of his half-eaten bun, and Sirius waved it off.
Sirius: That's the problem, though, isn't it?"
1,830080,Sirius,Remus,"Sirius: Bloody Lily Potter and her bloody machinations.
Remus: That's no way to talk about the mother of your future godson.
Sirius: That's the problem, though, isn't it? I mean, when the love of your best friend's life comes to you and says, oi, Sirius, your godson's got to get signed up for Hogwarts, of course you say yes, Lily, indeed he does.
Remus: *listened sympathetically, licking the icing off the bun.*
Sirius: And she says well good, Sirius, can you give us a hand? of course you say --
Remus: -- me being Sirius --
Sirius: -- right -- you say yes, sure, do I need to fill out a form? Permit slip? Get myself listed in case someone hexes him into a ferret?
Remus: A ferret?
Sirius: It could happen. And she says no, really there's just this little favour, and there you sit, on the steps of Hogwarts, saving a spot in line for bloody Potter, who's planning on fucking around and not coming to relieve me until six.
Remus: Buck up Padfoot, it could be worse.
Sirius: Oh yeah?
Remus: Well, yes. I mean, your best friend could have come up to you and said Oi, Remus, how about a night on the town? I'll drive, and then proceeded to fly you to Hogwarts to sit with him while he waits in line for bloody Potter, who's actually planning on fucking around and not coming to relieve you until eight. Furthermore, Hogwarts could be inApperateable, meaning that your only choices are to remain with said nameless friend until James arrives, or walk to Hogsmeade and listen to his howls of abandonment the whole way there.
Sirius: Is that all?
Remus: Oh, and he could have brought only cinnamon buns.
Sirius: That little carpet lizard had better be grateful to his godfather, that's all I have to say.
Remus: He's still in his nice warm womb --
Sirius: Sirius, yuk!
Remus: -- and I'm out here with a whiny werewolf and blasted cinnamon buns, when I specifically said almond buns.
Remus: Honestly, Sirius, don't you think it's rather fun? Or will be, when someone else shows up. I remember the Signing Days when we were at school. All the nervous parents waiting until the doors opened at midnight so they could register their children -- remember the one year we charmed waterballoons to chase the stragglers like bludgers?
Sirius: I did a month's detention for that.
Remus: Wouldn't have been more'n a week if one of the Damp hadn't been a bigwig at the Ministry.
Sirius: You, however, still owe me a month's detention.
Remus: I'm sure we can come to an arrangement.
Remus: Listen, the point is, it's always terribly exciting and now we'll have come full circle, won't we? I mean, we'll get to be the ones who parade into the great hall at Midnight and put down a name, just like we used to watch other people do."
2,830080,Sirius,Remus,"Sirius: 's...Peter, Sirius answered. You, however, still owe me a month's detention.
Remus: I'm sure we can come to an arrangement, Remus said, hiding his grin behind some popcorn.
Sirius: Listen, the point is, it's always terribly exciting and now we'll have come full circle, won't we? I mean, we'll get to be the ones who parade into the great hall at Midnight and put down a name, just like we used to watch other people do and, you know, just like our parents did.
Sirius: My parents never stood in line, you can be sure of that, Sirius grumbled.
Remus: They have to, don't they? It's the law. Even Board of Governors members have to stand in line, that's what Dumbledore always said.
Sirius: Probably polyjuiced someone else up to look like them, Sirius answered.
Sirius: My mum didn't leave the house when she was pregnant. For love of Merlin, she called it her 'confinement'. And you can be sure Dad never did anything so...democratic, he mock-sneered.
Remus: Well, my parents took pictures, they were that proud, Remus answered cheerily.
Remus: Oh, I should have brought my camera.
Sirius: You can't think of staying for the whole thing, Sirius said. We're going to be here all bloody day as it is!
Remus: Well, why not? It's a rite of passage, and it's not like I'm going to have kids.
Sirius: Why wouldn't you have kids?
Remus: Don't be dim. A werewolf has a one in four chance of fathering a werewolf.
Sirius: Right. Well, you could adopt.
Remus: Yes, because if I'm not allowed to be a legal godfather I'm sure they're going to let me adopt, Remus said drily. It's fine, I'm not actually all that fond of children.
Sirius: Liar, Sirius said, but Remus fell silent, so he didn't press the point.
Remus: Did your parents really take pictures? he asked.
Remus: Oh yes, Remus answered. They made a trip out of it. Mum wasn't very far along, see, so they decided they'd take the train up as far as Muggle trains go, and did some touristing, and a weekend in Hogsmeade and all. They did up a scrapbook of the whole thing.
Sirius: Your mum and scrapbooks, Sirius groaned.
Remus: You're in most of them, you should feel honoured, Remus teased. Everyone's always asking who the handsome young bloke next to me is in the photos whenever she brings them out. And then I tell them that's James.
Sirius: Sirius shoved his shoulder, and popcorn went flying. A couple of magpies flew down and began fighting over them, and Remus added another handful to the white kernels scattering the ground. Four for a boy, he said, pointing to them. Five for silver, Sirius added, as another one fluttered down.
Remus: Doesn't count, I said four first, Remus said smugly. Look, someone else is coming.
Sirius: HALOOOOO LADS! boomed a deep voice from across the grounds, and a familiar figure came into view. Sirius stood and waved, grinning. It's Frank! he said, and took off down the hill, leaving Remus to sit on the steps and feed popcorn to the five magpies, two ducks, and squirrel now vying for it. It was starting to taste more and more like cinnamon, the lower in the bag he got.
Frank: Well, how're you then? Frank Longbottom said, as he and Sirius reappeared at the steps to the school. Hallo Lupin, how's things?
Remus: Fine thanks, Frank, and yourself?
Frank: Couldn't be better! Am I number three?
Sirius: Number two, we're both here for the Potters, Sirius answered.
Frank: Roped you in, did they?
Remus: Godfathering business, Remus said, nudging Sirius as he sat again. Frank stood, hands in his pockets."
3,830080,Frank Longbottom,Remus,"Frank Longbottom: Hallo Lupin, how's things?
Remus: Fine thanks, Frank, and yourself?
Frank Longbottom: Couldn't be better! Am I number three?
Sirius: Number two, we're both here for the Potters.
Frank Longbottom: Roped you in, did they?
Remus: Godfathering business.
Frank Longbottom: Yourself?
Sirius: Neville Longbottom, Class of 1998.
Frank Longbottom: Cor, there's a scary thought, isn't it?
Sirius: No scarier than Anonymous Potter, Class of 1998.
Frank Longbottom: Haven't they named that kid yet?
Remus: They're still pondering.
Sirius: Lily wants a nice normal name --
Remus: Sirius is a perfectly normal name!
Sirius: A normal Muggle name.
Remus: And James wants to name him after a Greek god, and Sirius has clear Ideas on the matter.
Frank Longbottom: Well, my mam's making me name him Neville, but it's a nice enough name, I don't mind.
Frank Longbottom: I think she's more excited about the baby than we are. Can't imagine why.
Frank Longbottom: Look, isn't that little Brenda Rourke?
Remus: Finnegan now.
Remus: Sirius, don't be an ass, go give her a hand.
Sirius: You give her a hand.
Frank Longbottom: Spendid, we've enough for Bridge now.
Frank Longbottom: My god, Brenda, is that twins?
Brenda: By all means, ladies first.
Brenda: It's not twins, it just looks it.
Frank Longbottom: A nine-stone woman carrying a twelve pound baby --
Frank Longbottom: Twelve pounds?
Brenda: I'm going to kill Jonathan.
Remus: Why are you here?
Brenda: No, I mean -- shouldn't your bloke be here?
Frank Longbottom: You know, when Little Finnegan starts levitating the dog, you're going to have to tell his father you're a witch.
Sirius: No worries, I've got it.
Sirius: Been spending a lot of time with James and Lily, she does this all the time...it's hormones, that's all, isn't it duck?
Frank Longbottom: Did he just call her Duck?
Remus: Now you see why he got the godfathering job.
Remus: He's a big softie under the leather.
Remus: Is this the line for Hogwarts Signings, tall sir?
Remus: Are you here to bring us cocoa?
Frank Longbottom: It is, but house-elves aren't allowed to sign, I'm sure of it.
Sirius: Master Who?
Dobby: Master Draco, who is being born next Tuesday.
Sirius: Bloody Narcissa.
Sirius: Fine, well, you're behind Longbottom there, who's behind Finnegan, who's behind Remus and me. Sorry, Brenda, Lily'd kill and eat me if she knew I let anyone get in front of me.
Brenda: As long as he gets his name on the register I don't care.
Dobby: This is what Master Malfoy is saying, only he is adding 'who I have to push over to get there' onto the end.
Sirius: He would.
Sirius: Is there any popcorn left, Remus?"
4,830080,Remus,Brenda,"Remus: Sorry, Brenda, Lily'd kill and eat me if she knew I let anyone get in front of me.
Brenda: As long as he gets his name on the register I don't care.
Dobby: This is what Master Malfoy is saying, Dobby said hesitantly, Only he is adding 'who I have to push over to get there' onto the end.
Sirius: He would. Is there any popcorn left, Remus?
Remus: There's half a bun and some suspicious looking red things that might be exploded cinnamon bits. And it's the bit of bun I licked all the icing off of.
Brenda: I've got Chinese rice. And some ice cream. Still fresh, has a chilling charm on it.
Sirius: Nah, give me the bun.
Frank: Black, you're a pig.
Sirius: What? S'no worse than borrowing pants off each other and we did that all the time in school.
Remus: Remus didn't lick those first!
Frank: I hope to god not.
Remus: Funny-cinnamon-bit?
Brenda: Is anyone up for cards?
Frank: Looks like we'll be here for a while.
Remus: All right, show me how to play Bridge again.
Sirius: It's useless, Frank, I've tried three times. I think he doesn't really want to learn.
Remus: Show me again anyhow, at least Sirius will have something to laugh at.
Brenda: Remus, will you hold my place? I have to pee. And probably will again in forty or fifty minutes.
Remus: It's going to be a long day.
Bill Weasley: Mind yourself. There's a couple of Slytherins planning on hexing the first parents through the doors.
Sirius: We'll hex 'em right back, and it's no use trying that trick to get us to let you go first.
Bill Weasley: It's no matter to me, I've made arrangements with McGonagall. She agreed to put the kid's name down out of sheer pity for our mum, I'm standing in line mostly for the form of the thing. Plus, gets me out of classes.
Frank: Another boy?
Bill Weasley: This makes six. Mum says she's cutting dad off after the next one, and we're just hoping she doesn't mean literally.
Ram Patil: I think Sara's cutting me off after these two.
Sirius: And I thought one was bad.
Brenda: I can only imagine. Do you get the little vein things?
Sara: Oh yes. And the swollen ankles. And the bloating.
Brenda: And the strange cravings.
Sirius: NO MORE. NO MORE TALK OF PLACENTAS AND FLUIDS!
Sara: Do not yell at a..."
5,830080,Brenda,Sara,"Brenda: thought one was bad, Brenda said to Sara, sympathetically. I can only imagine. Do you get the little vein things?
Sara: Oh yes. And the swollen ankles. And the bloating, Sara complained.
Brenda: And the strange cravings, Brenda agreed. And the discha --
Sirius: NO MORE, Sirius boomed. NO MORE TALK OF PLACENTAS AND FLUIDS!
Sara: *grabbed him by the collar and pulled him close.* Do not yell at a pregnant woman, she said darkly. Sirius gulped. Remus gently pried her fingers off his shirt.
Remus: I tell you what, Bill, I'll hold your place, Remus said, And you can run inside and get some butterbeers and pumpkin juices from the kitchen, and then nobody will attempt to kill anyone else.
Bill: Right, Bill said, dusting off his trousers as he stood. Can't have the future leaders of our nation traumatised en utero. Still got enough chips, Ms. Finnegan? Ms. Patil?
Brenda: Yes, thank you Bill, I'll just toddle along with you, Brenda said. My forty minutes are up.
Bill: *gallantly offered his arm to Brenda, and they vanished around the corner of the school.*
Sirius: We could sneak in, you know, Sirius said thoughtfully. Duck in the side-gate and --
Remus: Remember the last dad who tried that? I think he's still got hooves instead of hands, Remus said.
Sirius: That was brilliant, Sirius agreed.
Frank: Oh look, another one, Frank remarked lazily, as someone began walking up the line towards the doors.
Sirius: Got your Resolute Face on, Sirius? Sirius pursed his lips as the grandfatherly-looking wizard approached. Not for sale! he said, indicating his place in the line. The man sighed. Worth a try, he grumbled, slinking back down the line. Sirius tossed a card down.
Remus: Breaks your heart, Remus said thoughtfully.
Sirius: Yeah, breaks my heart to see a chap who got here at four in the afternoon try to buy his way to the front, Sirius snorted. We suffered for this spot!
Remus: Yes, cinnamon buns and half an hour of utter solitude, early this morning. Oh how we suffer, Remus drawled.
Sirius: Still, you know if he thought hexing me into next week would get him up here, he would, Sirius replied. People are vicious when it comes to their kids.
Frank: When you have one of your own you'll understand, Frank said. The kid isn't even born yet and already I'm fitting new locking spells on the doors.
Sirius: Not gonna have kids, Sirius said. That's what godkids are for.
Bill: Amen to that, Bill said, coming around the corner. Every time she pees she swears at her husband like it's his fault.
Sirius: You ovulated!
Brenda: Oooh, if I could move comfortably I'd give you such a thumping, Brenda groaned. Remus, punch him for me.
Remus: *Remus obediently punched Sirius in the arm, and Sirius punched back, and they tumbled around in the dust, wrestling.*
Frank: First one unconscious loses his place in line! Frank called, as the people behind him craned their necks and began taking bets.
Remus: Gotcha! Remus crowed, pinning Sirius with his legs and lifting his hands over his head in triumph.
Sirius: *Several people groaned and paid a select few, who were grinning smugly. An owl drifted down and settled on Sirius' chest, looking at him with a quizzical expression. Remus grabbed it and pulled the letter off while it squawked, before handing the fluttering creature to Sirius and rolling away.* It's from James, he said. Dear Sirius -- oh, they're going to be a bit late, he said, folding the letter up again.
Sirius: Late? Sirius inquired.
Remus: Sure, but you can go at eight and I'll stay here --  Remus grabbed for the letter back, but Sirius had already plucked it up out of his hands. FALSE LABOR? Sirius shouted.
Brenda: Oh, the poor --  Brenda began, but Sirius took no heed.
Sirius: Dear Sirius, Lily gone into false labor, staying the night at St. Mungo's, sign the kid up for us and I'll buy you dinner, Sirius read, furious. All bloody day I've been here! If I hadn't kidnapped Lupin I'd have killed someone out of sheer boredom, probably that bloody House Elf!
Dobby: *Dobby skittered quickly behind Frank, who made frantic silencing gestures.* Now, you see what you get when you don't let me lie to you? Rem"
6,830080,Sirius,Frank,"Sirius: What's an elevator? Frank asked curiously.
Remus: Muggle culture is lost on magic-borns, Remus said with a sigh. Look at Sirius. Fine specimen of a man, has a flying motorbike, top NEWTs, Hogwarts boy, and yet refuses, absolutely refuses, to even try to understand the Muggle cinema.
Sirius: I like the candy, Sirius protested.
Remus: Candy is not the majority of the Muggle Cinematic Experience! Remus exclaimed. I took you to see Star Wars and you picked it to death!
Sirius: Well, who cares about Muggles throwing fireballs at each other and racing things that can't fly more than four feet off the ground, Sirius grumbled.
Frank: Two hours, Frank announced, putting away his pocketwatch.
Remus: That's not spiked tea, he said, That's tea-flavoured whiskey. You'd better be able to write the kid's name, come midnight.
Sirius: Can you, now? Sirius asked, with a grin.
Remus: Oh bugger that's right, they still haven't picked a damn name. Do you think they'll take 'Potter to be determined at a later date'?
Remus: Oh, just put something down, Remus sighed. Name him Sirius if you really must.
Sirius: I'll tell Lily you told me to, Sirius threatened.
Remus: Well, if I'm going to die over his name, we ought to at least name him Remus. Or perhaps anything but Remus, he finished thoughtfully.
Remus: Got to start with an R. Old family tradition, Remus said. Richard's good. Rory. Roland, I quite like Roland, he added. The horn of Roland in the passages of Spain...
Sara: Padma and Parvati, said Sara, smiling shyly at her husband. What about you, Brenda?
Brenda: Good Irish name, Brenda said. Thinking of Seamus.
Bill: And Longbottom's mum picked Neville, and the Weasleys --
Sirius: Good lord, at this point, draw one out of a hat, Bill said. It's planets and things in my family, Sirius said. Perseus and Mars and Polaris and all.
Sirius: Nother one coming, he sighed. You'd think they'd have learned by now --
Dobby: It is Master! Dobby exclaimed. He quickly scuttled into line outside of the fire and stood there at attention.
Lucius: Elf, Lucius said, as he finally approached Dobby, who began to tremble, What DID I say about getting to the front of the line?"
7,830080,Sirius,Lucius,"Sirius: Do you like my cane? It's to make up for the fact that I have a very small --

Lucius: Elf, Lucius said, as he finally approached Dobby, who began to tremble, What DID I say about getting to the front of the line?
Dobby: Dobby is very sorr --

Sirius: Hello, Cousin Lucius.
Lucius: Cousin? Oh no, my dear boy. Did you forget you've been disowned and shunned?
Sirius: Thank god, I thought I was still stuck with your sort as family. It was a sad day when Narcissa lowered herself to marrying a Malfoy.

Sirius: In 1592 a Malfoy sold herself into indentured servitude in the house of Black. And in 1870 a Black was forced to divorce a Malfoy --
Lucius: That is unsubstantiated rumour, whelp!
Sirius: But a better-bred whelp than you are. And first in line.

Remus: Not for two hundred.
Lucius: I didn't ask the half-breed.
Sirius: I was actually going to bargain with you for a while, just to see how desperate you'd get, right up until you said that.

Frank: Oh look, a stick. Inside a stick.
Frank: I'm sure you wouldn't want to hex an innocent, inexperienced young man in front of an Auror. Or indulge in bribery as a method of assuring your child a place at Hogwarts School. Especially as your house elf has been holding your place as seventh-in-line and winning at Bridge all day.
Lucius: Seventh?

Bill: Hi, my name is Another, he said, introducing himself to Brenda. I'm gonna ask mum if we can name him that. Dad's stuck us all with boring Muggle names.

Sirius: Give my love to Cissa!
Remus: Yes, what a curse on us that he should be so handsome.
Sirius: Hope the whole Malfoy clan goes squib. Serve them right. Blacks too. Cept for me. And Andromeda, he added thoughtfully. She's not a bad sort.

Frank: Might want to actually sort into a line of some kind."
8,830080,Frank,Sirius,"Frank: Almost time for the doors to open, and people are going to really try to start line-jumping soon, I bet. Might want to actually sort into a line of some kind.
Sirius: Yaarhgh.
Frank: *pushing himself to his feet and dusting his trousers off directly onto Remus, who sputtered and stood quickly to get out of the way.*
Frank: Hope Lily's doing all right.
Sirius: Bet you they went out for dinner and just didn't want to come.
Sirius: Well, if I put down the name Another Potter, it'll only serve them right.
Remus: Makes me feel old.
Sirius: You? How d'you think I feel? If James and Lily kill each other, as they're bound to do sooner or later, I'm stuck with a kid. I've got to be a role model and all. You get to be fun uncle Remus.
Remus: Yeah, I guess. S'not really what I meant, though.
Sirius: Oh? Enlighten me, great one.
Remus: It's just, you know, I feel tired. I mean, James and Lily've got something real. They've got a baby, and it's theirs, and the rest of us are...treading water. I keep waiting for my life to start, Sirius, and instead what I get is the war. I'm tired of the war. I'm tired of fighting on the one hand and on the other trying to make enough to feed myself. I feel old.
Minerva McGonagall: Mister Black, I suppose it's too much to hope that you've made an honest woman of whoever it is you're standing in line for.
Sirius: James went ahead and did it for me, ma'am. I'm here to sign for Potter, Male, Name Indeterminate. Look, I brought the good influence with me.
Minerva McGonagall: Remus Lupin! Are you drunk?
Remus: No, ma'am. Just a bit tired, Professor McGonagall.
Frank Longbottom: Bit of a nip round the fire, that's all, ma'am.
Minerva McGonagall: Almost time, then?
Sirius: On a personal note, It's good to see you boys in such high spirits. Though perhaps a little too high, in some cases.
Albus Dumbledore: Mr. Black.
Sirius: Headmaster.
Dumbledore: I can hardly think your own offspring bring you here tonight, Sirius."
9,830080,Sirius,Dumbledore,"Sirius: Headmaster, *replied just as deadpan.*
Dumbledore: I can hardly think your own offspring bring you here tonight, Sirius.
Sirius: My godson, *announced, the words echoing pleasingly off the high, enchanted ceiling.* James and Lily's firstborn.
Dumbledore: Ah, of course. And Mr. Lupin?
Remus: Babysitting Mr. Black, *replied with a grin, leaning over Sirius' shoulder.*
Dumbledore: You'd best be getting on with it then, *unrolling the parchment and flattening it with a muttered charm.* The child's name on the left, expected date of attendance, and your names as signers on the right, please.
Sirius: We haven't got a name yet, *hissed as they came forward.*
Remus: Put any old thing, *hissed back.* Didn't Lily say she liked Harry?
Sirius: Blow that for a lark, *declared.* He's having a proper wizarding name.
Frank: Come on Black, *called,* They're rattling the sabers, put the name down already.
Sirius: You can't be --
Remus: Just sign! *Sirius said impatiently.*
Remus: James is going to have our heads, *he said, and signed.*
Dumbledore: Thank you, gentlemen, *Dumbledore said.* Please remind Mr. and Mrs. Potter that this is legally binding, and should the child's name be altered significantly he may be required to be re-registered.
Remus: We're in for it now, *he said.* Let's take James out and get him drunk before we tell him, all right?

Harry: What you have to remember, Harry, *Remus said,* is that we were both very young and your parents had more or less abandoned us, and we didn't actually know that the name on the parchment was binding.
Harry: Are you all right, Harry? *Remus asked, worried.*
Harry: My name is SIRIUS ROLAND DIONYSUS HARRY POTTER.
Remus: Well, it could have been Harold..."
