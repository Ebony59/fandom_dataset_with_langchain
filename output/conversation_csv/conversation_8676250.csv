0,8676250,Newt,Niffler,"Newt: Nice try, *gave the niffler a shake to make sure it didn't have anything shiny and stolen in its pouch*.
Newt: You and I are going to have a chat later.
Newt: *picked up the cigarette case* Maybe the owner's name would be engraved on the inside of the lid.
Newt: *popped open the catch* He had just enough time to realize that the tingling in his fingers had been caused by an almost completely decayed suspended animation hex and then things got very exciting.
Unknown man: *popped out of the cigarette case* Give me your wand, or I'll kill you before your beloved leader Grindelwald ever has the chance.
Percival Graves: Your what?
Newt: My niffler. Magical creature - rather like a magpie. They love shiny things.
Percival Graves: The transportation and importation of magical creatures is illegal in America."
1,8676250,Graves,Newt,"Graves: You want me to stay in a confined, magically-altered space… after being trapped in one against my will for three months.
Newt: Well, you don’t have to stay in there the entire time, and it’s really quite spacious. I spend quite a lot of time down there. And all of the creatures are spelled to encourage them to stay in their habitats.
Graves: Encourage them to-
Newt: Come on. I’ll introduce you to everyone.
Graves: You want me to feed them?
Newt: Of course. If you’re going to be spending time here, it’s best if everyone gets to know you."
2,8676250,Newt,Graves,"Newt: They’re very accepting of strangers if rather shy. *brightened up again*
Graves: You want me to feed them? *a touch disbelievingly*
Newt: Of course. If you’re going to be spending time here, it’s best if everyone gets to know you.
Graves: Right. He had been an auror for more than a decade. He could handle feeding a few bizarre, questionably-obtained, magical creatures if it would help him get back to America. He’d done much worse jobs.
Graves: *tosses the rest of the herd another handful of pellets*
Newt: Oh, here. This is what I found you in, so you should probably have it.
Graves: *accepts the cigarette case with only the barest outward signs of reluctance*
Newt: I’ll, uh, just go and get us some supper then.
Graves: *awoken by a slight weight leaning against his ribcage*
Graves: This is evidence. *talking to the niffler*
Graves: Fine. *hands over the cigarette case*"
3,8676250,Graves,Newt,"Graves: Where are your permits?
Newt: Pardon?
Graves: Your permits. Where are they? I would like to look them over.
Newt: Oh, I keep them in- here. *produces a slightly battered wallet* There you are."
4,8676250,Newt,Graves,"Newt: There you are. *proffered the papers to Graves*
Graves: Thank you. *accepted the papers*
Newt: You don't have a permit for the nundu. *paused* Nundu... aren't those the creatures which regularly wipe out entire wizarding enclaves in Africa?
Newt: They only wipe out villages if they're provoked. *paused* And I don't have a permit so much as a signed proclamation from the Magical Governor of Zimbabwe ordering me not to give it back and promising that he will declare war on any nation which tries to return the nundu to them. I think it's a little over the top really.
Newt: As long as he gets his peppermint tonic once every other day, he's no trouble at all. *assured him*
Graves: *stared at him*
Graves: Your international magical creature importation permit needs to be renewed by the end of the month and your permit for the doxies expired in February. *handed the papers back over*
Newt: Really? *paused* Thank you for telling me.
Graves: *nodded*
Newt: *gave him a brief flash of a smile in return*
Graves: *turned his head*
Graves: Can I help you? *raised an eyebrow at it* You're not going to find anything else. The cigarette case was all I had. Grindelwald took the rest."
5,8676250,Graves,Newt,"Graves: You're not going to find anything else. The cigarette case was all I had. Grindelwald took the rest. *raised an eyebrow at it*
Graves: How big can one of these grow naturally? *delicately scratched the underside of its chin with the tip of his finger*
Newt: Females can reach up to fifteen feet when fully grown without magically altering their size.
Newt: *laughed* There's something you've got to see!
Graves: Did you need something?
Newt: There's something you've got to see!"
6,8676250,Newt,Graves,"Newt: I’ve only ever seen them do this once before, *breathed, his voice barely a whisper.* Together they peered around the rock.
Graves: *spared a moment to glance over at Newt.* His eyes were bright in the moonlight, wide with fascination and wonder. The corners of his mouth turned up softly, and his hair reflected a shattered cascade of silver sparks.
Graves: *turned his attention back to the swaying mooncalf.* It now had gained a partner who was dancing intricate loops beside it.
Graves: *woke to natural sunlight streaming across his face.* What-? Oh, that was right. Newt had offered to let him sleep up in the cabin the previous night after the mooncalves had finished dancing. He had wanted to make notes on his observations. That explained the natural light. It didn’t explain the warm fuzzy weights sleeping on top of him.
Graves: *gathered up the snoozing creatures.* Walter must have let them all out. Oh, hell. Walter slept without any dignity or shame with limbs splayed everywhere. The edge of something glittery was sticking out of its pouch. It had probably robbed the entire boat blind overnight. Before Graves took his international portkey back to America, he was marching Newt straight to a mechanist’s to get those latches on his case fixed.
Graves: *paused at the bottom of the ladder.* Newt was fast asleep at his desk, quill still held loosely in one hand and he was practically buried beneath magical creatures. Bowtruckles waved gently in his hair, the demiguise was curled up on his lap, occamy chicks were draped across his shoulders like feathery scarves, doxies nestled in the crook of his arm, and the massive nundu of all things had its head resting on the floor near Newt’s feet. The nundu lifted its head and blinked languidly at Graves as if to say, “What are you doing up? It’s far too early.” Then it licked its paw, closed its eyes and went back to sleep. It was, without a doubt, the most ludicrous thing Graves had ever seen. It looked like an accident waiting to happen.
Graves: *smiled just a little bit anyway.*"
7,8676250,Newt,Graves,"Newt: She’s moody because she didn’t find a mate while she was in season. *informed Graves in a soft voice as if he didn’t want the erumpent overhearing him and having her feelings hurt.*
Graves: *just nodded.* He was too busy breathing through the breathtaking adrenaline rush of outrunning an erumpent without magic to care about the exact cause. He’d missed this since becoming head auror. It had been too long since he’d truly been out in the field. Graves had never been particularly fond of desk work.
Newt: *frowning down at the erumpent with concern.* This doesn’t become you at all, you know. You’ll feel much better with some extra potassium and iron in your diet. It’ll stop your feet from getting cramps. *The erumpent let out a trumpeting snort sound. Newt let out the sigh of a put-upon parent dealing with a particularly temperamental child.*
Graves: *The corners of his mouth pulled up minutely.* They’d been doing that an awful lot over the last five days. Probably more than they had in the past year.
Graves: Oh, hell. *He didn’t want to go back. He didn’t want to go back to his cold, lonely apartment and his desk covered in paperwork surrounded by fellow aurors who didn’t know him well enough to spot an imposter. He wanted to stay here with this mad, British magizoologist and his menagerie of dubiously legal magical creatures.*
Graves: *Damn it.* Newt was not looking forward to arriving in France as much as he’d thought he would.
Newt: *He’d been anticipating sending his first draft of his manuscript onto his publisher and then heading back to Africa or possibly central Europe or Australia to continue his research. One year in the field was only the beginning. His contract covered at least another year of field research – possibly two if his first edition was well received – and Newt wasn’t about to waste that time on something as mundane as editing.*
Newt: *Well, humans came and went. Shouldn’t he have learned that by now? Only creatures stayed. Either way, they’d be arriving in France tomorrow.*
Newt: *He’d really been enjoying having someone to share his creatures with.*"
8,8676250,Graves,Walter,"Graves: What in the blazes? *shifts and rubs sleep out of one eye*
Walter: *lifts its head and squints at the gold coin* *plucks the coin from Graves's fingers and tucks it back beneath his ribcage* *huffs and flops back down*
Graves: *sits up* *puffskeins roll away* *Walter plops into his lap with an indignant noise of protest*
Graves: Do you know why Walter felt the need to hide things in my bed last night?
Newt: Who? *looks up from his fidgeting, his eyebrows knitting in confusion*
Graves: The niffler. It reminds me of a petty thief I used to arrest quite often.
Newt: Oh! It does suit him, doesn't it? I usually just call him 'pilfering pest' or 'thieving bugger'. *eyebrows rise as he takes note of the shiny trinkets lying on top of the blankets* I, uh... I think he's trying to bribe you.
Graves: Bribe me?
Newt: To stay.
Graves: *smuggling Graves through muggle customs was no harder than smuggling his case through muggle customs ever was* *explaining to the goblins at the Paris branch of Gringotts why Graves should be allowed into the bank when he didn't have so much as a passport to prove his identity was a touch more exciting* *took close to an hour of talking and two complicated magical identification spells before Newt finally found himself standing in front of a large communication mirror waiting for someone in MACUSA to answer the mirror's summons* *Graves was standing off to one side after they had agreed that it probably wasn't best to completely startle whoever answered the mirror*"
9,8676250,Newt,Mr. Scamander,"Newt: Mr. Scamander, I wasn't expecting to hear from you for at least a year.
Newt: Ah. Yes. Well, about that. It would seem that I found something that you lost.
Newt: Madam President. Goldstein. Harper.
Tina: Mr. Graves?
President Picquery: His identity has been verified?
Newt: Twice over by the goblins.
President Picquery: Then I must say it's good to see you alive, Mr. Graves.
Graves: Thank you.
Graves: I haven't noticed any lingering side effects from my imprisonment and am ready to take an international portkey back to New York as soon as possible.
Graves: Percival, we believed you to be dead. LeRoy Hunt has been made head of the Department of Magical Law Enforcement. Your personal possessions were put into storage.
Graves: I see.
Newt: Um, you know, my research budget has provisions in it for an assistant.
Newt: An assistant? Or a bodyguard. Professor Dumbledore suggested that. I'm not entirely sure if he was joking or not."
