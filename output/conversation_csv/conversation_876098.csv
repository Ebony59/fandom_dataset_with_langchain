0,876098,Hermione,Plump woman,"Hermione: First trip to Diagon, then? *wide-eyes, parents' numb expressions*
Hermione: Yes, it's amazing.
Plump woman: Don't worry, dear, we'll get you fixed up. *pulling out robes, skirts, button ups, ties, scarves, all in dull black, white, and grey*
Plump woman: Don't worry, dear. They'll get a little color to them once you've been sorted. But I don't want to ruin it for you!"
1,876098,Hermione,Woman,"Hermione: Yes, it's amazing, *politely replied.*
Woman: Don't worry, dear, we'll get you fixed up. *Began pulling out robes, skirts, button ups, ties, scarves, all in dull black, white, and grey.* Don't worry, dear. They'll get a little color to them once you've been sorted. But I don't want to ruin it for you!
Woman: Now, we do have a large selection of wristbands. Usually people get two. One for decoration, and one for everyday coverage.
Hermione: No, thank you, *she said quickly.* I'm not the jewelry type.
Woman: Oh, silly me, of course no one has told you. *She said quickly, blushing a little.* See, at some point while you are growing up, your magic will manifest itself physically. You will get a set of words on your wrist. These words will be specific to your soulmate, the one person your magic knows you are supposed to be with. *She began laying out ones that Hermione might be interested in.* But they are intensely personal, these words. They can be almost anything - I've even heard of someone who had a date, time, and address. But since you will literally be wearing your heart on your sleeve, you have these to cover up. People don't always wear them with long sleeves, they get a little uncomfortable, but everyone will expect you to be wearing one if your wrists are otherwise bare.
Hermione: Then...I will take these two. *She said with more confidence than she felt.*
Hermione: The words aren't very exciting to her for the next two years. Lavender and Parvati giggle about them sometimes, wondering what theirs will be, but she doesn't focus on them and the boys practically never mention it. She carries the cloth wristband in her pocket at all times, but she never worries because she is not the kind to roll up the sleeves on her uniform. But they come into her life in her third year, and she will never forget the circumstances. Harry received a broom, the best broom, anonymously, and she was worried. She'd already had to watch him fall off his broom once, and she refuses to do so again. As Professor McGonagall leaves the room and the boys turn on her, as she defends herself (and she will cherish for years that technically, she was right, Sirius HAD been the one to send the broom), her wrist begins to itch. She is too busy with the accusations and the tears and the angry huff of both boys turning their backs on her to worry about the burning sensation. But as soon as she gets to her bed and pulls the curtains, she looks, and there, written in blood red, are two words.
Hermione: The Hallows. *She doesn't have free time, what with classes and Buckbeak, but she makes this a priority to the best of her ability. Eventually, she asks Madam Pince for a book on The Hallows. The woman laughs (she will, every once in a while, but only when Hermione can see her), asks if her dorm mates have been telling tales, and writes down the call number for a book called The Tales of Beedle the Bard.*
Hermione: She cries all the time, now. It's as if it's her first year all over again - no friends, overwhelmed, and depressed. In this case, it's worse, because she had friends, actual friends, and had lost them. She was overwhelmed because she was in too deep, and there was no adjustment period, as far as she could tell, no way she was going to just hit her stride and settle in. And she is depressed. It's the friends, and the work, but it's also the words. She got her words (before Lavender or Parvati, as far as she can tell), but she wishes she hadn't. Because her words are associated with death and sadness. It is at this point when she begins to realize that surely not everyone in the Wizarding World has a happy ending, and it looks as if she had been selected to be one of those people.
Hermione: When she is again in the Hospital Wing, and she has watched Harry almost die again tonight (multiple times), she stops trying to connect them to Harry. He has enough death in his life without her trying to push her words on him. Even though it..."
2,876098,Hermione,Seamus,"Hermione: Yes, mum, I'm still wearing it, she said delicately, trying to decide whether she should go for the truth or say that the wizarding idea of the wrist being obscene had been so instilled in her that she just couldn't bear to be without it. I-er-I got my words this year. Truth, it was.
Hermione's mother: Oh, Hermione, that's wonderful! Well, go on. Let's see.
Hermione: She pulls off the band and shows her mother the two words which had haunted her for months, in a really very gorgeous shade of red and that universal looping cursive in which all magical quills seem to write. Oh, love, it's gorgeous. Have you figured it out, yet?
Hermione: The truth, but not the full truth. No, mum. Anyway, it's specific to the other person. I might not know at all until they bring it up. There are stories of people not finding out for years until someone else says it casually in conversation or something.
Hermione's mother: Well, I'm sure you'll figure it out. You're so clever. Her mom runs her fingers through her hair and laughs. Hermione wishes she could laugh about it.
Seamus: Er, knock knock? She hears Seamus say from the other side.
Hermione: Yes? She replies, surprised. They weren't unfriendly, but she couldn't remember the last time someone outside the boys had sought her out without an incomplete essay in hand.
Seamus: Well, I just - can I ask you a question?
Hermione: Of course, Seamus. Go ahead. This makes her comfortable again. She is used to being quizzed.
Seamus: Well, it's personal.
Hermione: Er, Seamus-
Seamus: Not personal about you. Personal about me. He looked away, cheeks flaming even though they were nowhere near the fire.
Hermione: Seamus, I know I don't come off as - well, I'm not known as the most fuzzy of people. She wasn't sure how to say this without sounding like a silly girl. But I'd never, ever tell. As long as no one is in immediate danger, your secret is safe with me, and I'm always up for a chat. It's sad, she thinks, that she is only 15 but she has to remember to make room for the possibility of immediate danger.
Seamus: Would you mind if I showed you my mark? I know it's personal-
Hermione: Oh, no, go ahead. I've never seen anyone else's before, I think it would be very interesting- He cuts her a look, and she manages to look a little embarrassed. I mean, I'm sure we can figure out the story behind your words.
Seamus: Well, it's not words so much as - well -"
3,876098,Seamus,Hermione,"Seamus: Would you mind if I showed you my mark? I know it's personal-
Hermione: Oh, no, go ahead. I've never seen anyone else's before, I think it would be very interesting- He cuts her a look, and she manages to look a little embarrassed. I mean, I'm sure we can figure out the story behind your words.
Seamus: Well, it's not words so much as - well - Seamus looked around carefully, then perched on the chair across from her and rolled up his sleeve.
Hermione: Oh! Seamus! I know what that is! She said, perhaps a little too loudly, and he jerked his sleeve back down. They both looked around, but no one bothered to pop around the wall of books.
Hermione: So, what's the verdict?
Seamus: Oh, it's quite simple. It's a football. It's used in a muggle sport, actually, she started rambling, very popular. In fact if you wanted to know more about it, you could probably ask Dean, he's- she stopped, eyes widening and breath catching, -crazy about it.
Seamus: Well. He said, not looking her in the eye. This is has been fun, but I think I'm just going to flee now. He began to get up from the chair across from her, and she grabbed his arm. His left arm. His left wrist.
Hermione: Seamus, don't, she said quickly. Don't do this. It's alright, you know. It's fine.
Seamus: What, that I'm apparently going to fall in love with my best friend?
Hermione: It's all fine.
Seamus: Oh, Merlin, I hadn't even come to terms with the fact that I like other blokes, much less this one. He's my best friend. What am I going to do, now? He asked.
Hermione: I don't know, Hermione replied. I'm sitting this whole thing out.
Seamus: What, entirely? Not going to try to figure out your words?
Hermione: Yes, well, She said, suddenly prim and proper. But, it only seemed fair. He hadn't asked for reciprocity, but it only seemed fair. Mine aren't exactly nice.
Seamus: Oh.
Hermione: Would you - well, do you want to see?
Seamus: Of course, Hermione.
Hermione: Oh, my God. He looked a little panicked. You know what those are?
Hermione: Of course. After she buttoned up her sleeve and let her robe fall back into place, she explained I looked it up. Just a fairy tale, nothing more.
Seamus: Not this one, Hermione. This one is death and destruction. Folly and - and hubris.
Hermione: You think I don't know? Her eyes flashed.
Seamus: Hey, calm down. You know my big secret. I'm not going to be mean to you about it. It's just - well, it's sad, isn't it? I mean, I always figured eventually Harry would wise up and-
Hermione: Don't take this the wrong way, Seamus, but I want nothing more than for Harry to have nothing to do with my words, all things considered.
Seamus: I know. But you guys could have been something, you know?
Hermione: I know. But I'm not the only person to ever have unhappy words. She raised her chin, and continued doing what she had been doing. Ignoring it.
Seamus: Well, I'm sorry.
Hermione: Around the side of the books, Hermione saw Dean Thomas's head. Oi, Seamus, there you are! Come on, I'm about to show some of the lads how to play football! You're going to love it! Meet us on the pitch!
Hermione: They both went instantly red, and Hermione whispered, He went off again. Good thing, too, give you a bit of time to get your composure.
Seamus: Thanks for this, Hermione. You're the best."
4,876098,Ron,Hermione,"Ron: Hermione, what are you doing? I don't care how tired your arms are, you can't stop stirring!
Hermione: I can't believe Snape even has words, much less-
Ron: You saw Snape's words?
Hermione: You didn't?
Harry: What did they say?
Hermione: I-I wasn't able to work out what they said. He was all the way across the classroom, after all.
Hermione: Lemon drops. She breathed. I know who-
McGonagall: Don't. It's nothing like what you are thinking.
Hermione: I think it is, Professor. You see, mine is red, too.
McGonagall: Not you.
Hermione: It's alright, Professor. I've had it worked out since 3rd year. I'm used to it.
McGonagall: *whispering* I'm sorry."
5,876098,Ron,Harry,"Ron: Don't worry, Harry's asleep so deep, a stampede of hippogriffs wouldn't wake him.
Hermione: You what?
Ron: I-well, I peeked. When we were all in the Hospital Wing. 5th year.
Hermione: 5th year? You've known all this time? Ron, that is such a huge invasion of privacy, I can't even-
Ron: Look, I had a reason. And I've got something I want to say about it, and I'm just worried that I won't get another shot.
Hermione: We don't talk like that, Ron, you know that.
Ron: I know. But look, humor me. I thought they might be for me. At the time, I thought mine were for you.
Hermione: That doesn't excuse anything, you..."
6,876098,Ron,Hermione,"Ron: Look, I had a reason. And I've got something I want to say about it, and I'm just worried that I won't get another shot.
Hermione: We don't talk like that, Ron, you know that.
Ron: I know. But look, humor me.
Hermione: *glaring at him*
Ron: I thought they might be for me. At the time, I thought mine were for you.
Hermione: That doesn't excuse anything, you selfi-
Ron: *pulls off his band and shows her* Lionheart. I thought it meant you, from the day I got it. Everyone thought you'd be more suited in Ravenclaw, but I knew better. We charged into danger right behind Harry time and again, and I knew that you were just as deserving of being a Gryffindor as the bravest of us.
Hermione: Ron, that's - well, that's very sweet.
Ron: So when I got the chance to see yours, to see if they matched, I just took it. I'd like to remind you that some giant brains had just fed on me, and Merlin only knows what kind of potions Pomfrey had given me. But I went to look at yours. And I want you to know that the only thing I thought of when I saw yours was sheer panic.
Hermione: Wow, thank you, Ron, that is absolutely lovely of you.
Ron: *waves his hands in surrender* That's not how I meant it, and you know it. Besides, you know what they mean.
Hermione: I know. I've had this long to get used to them.
Ron: Well, I was terrified they were for me. I'd never seen a red one before, and I thought it might be something bad, when coupled with what they mean. So I freaked out. That's why I was so awful to you last year. I'm sorry.
Hermione: *laughs a little* It's alright, Ron. I wasn't great to you last year, either.
Ron: *lets her almost-apology pass without comment* But, something happened recently. Someone made me realize that my words aren't for you, after all.
Hermione: What happened?
Ron: When we were at Shell Cottage. I was talking to Luna about how brave she had been, to be in there with that awful woman for so long. And you know what she said to me? 'Gryffindors aren't the only people with lion hearts.' I almost died. I think I played it off, maybe, and she went inside soon after that. But, Hermione. It's Luna. I can feel it.
Hermione: *smiles and ruffles his hair* Well, thank goodness. That poor girl has had such a crush on you forever.
Ron: Really, you think so?"
7,876098,Luna,Hermione,"Luna: The words are...not always concrete. The magic inside us can see into the future, somewhat. Divination. But, as I'm sure you know, divination is...an imprecise branch of magic.
Hermione: *snorts aloud*
Luna: Sometimes the words are concrete. But that is rare. More often, the words are subjective. They can apply to several situations or people. Ron's for example, are subjective. They are not exact directions, but something he feels.
Hermione: Luna, if you're feeling guilty-
Luna: It's of course entirely possible to love more than one person. The words are a guide, but they don't dictate our feelings for us. If someone were to bind up their wrist at 11 and never look at their words, they would still find a love just as true as the rest of us. We just choose only those who fit our words, because we understand that our magic understands more than we could ever hope to understand. Do you understand?
Hermione: I...think so.
Luna: Ron loved you. He did.
Hermione: Look, Luna, if you're looking for absolution, you can have it. I've always known that my words weren't for Ron. I love Ron, surely, but not like you do. And I would never want to stand in your way. If you're meant to be, then you're meant to be.
Luna: If I didn't know mine, I would probably think that his were for you. *begins to unbutton her sleeve* After all, I just said them in conversation, but you ARE the lion heart. *shows her wrist to Hermione*
Hermione: *gasps*
Luna: But, I've never had to doubt mine.
Hermione: Ronald Billius Weasley. You've had his name this whole time.
Luna: That's why I can be sure. Why I can let him be sure. I'm so sorry, Hermione. I'm sure there will be someone for you.
Hermione: *laughs and shakes her head* There never will, Luna. *unclips the pretty silver decorative cuff bracelet that her mother had gotten for her, to reveal her own words*
Luna: Oh, Hermione.
Hermione: It's alright. All you can do for me is be happy."
8,876098,Hermione,Harry,"Hermione: Oh, I couldn't possibly, I've got lots of other students to check on. *her feet are already moving toward him.*
Harry: Come over here! *looking at her with a pleading look.*
Hermione: Alright, everyone, go about your day. If I find out someone is following me, I'll be more than happy to start handing out detentions. *storms out and Harry follows her.*
Harry: Look, *laughing* Don't you have something else to do? Ginny will be here somewhere.
Hermione: Nope, *laughing* Filch gave her a detention right as she was about to leave, can you believe that?
Harry: Hey, I just wanted to say thank you, *rushing out* For whatever you said to Ginny to convince her. She showed me her words last time we met up. I don't know what she was so worried about. *laughing and shaking his head.*
Hermione: You didn't care? Not even a little?
Harry: Why would I care?
Hermione: Well, I mean, it's- *stopped*
Harry: Sure, I mean, it's a little weird that something about purity would be associated with me, I mean, I've got blood on my hands. But...I dunno, maybe that's how she sees me. What's with the weird reaction?
Hermione: Oh, nothing, *laughs, eyes looking for an escape route.*
Harry: You're a terrible liar. What are you keeping from me? *stopped her and put both hands on her shoulders.*"
9,876098,Hermione,Harry,"Hermione: I mean, I've got blood on my hands. But...I dunno, maybe that's how she sees me. What's with the weird reaction?
Unknown character: Oh, nothing, *laughs, eyes looking for an escape route.*
Unknown character: You're a terrible liar. What are you keeping from me? *stops her and put both hands on her shoulders. Her wrist flared up again.*
Unknown character: Nothing! *They were on the outskirts, now, and he coaxed her into a side alley.*
Unknown character: Do you know what her words are? *He asked calmly.*
Unknown character: Yes. Sanctimonia Vincet Semper. I...peeked. *He looked at her like she was crazy. When you wrote me last. I wanted to know why she wouldn't show you.*
Unknown character: To her relief he laughed. I knew you wouldn't keep out of trouble, even with Ron and me gone. Why did you freak out just now?*
Unknown character: She couldn't be the one to tell him. She wasn't petty. She wasn't trying to break them up. She had to keep reminding herself of this, because she felt pretty terrible about coming between them, no matter what she wanted. Believe me, Harry. You don't want to know. Just be happy.*
Harry: I can't do that now, Hermione, and you know that. What is it that you know?
Hermione: Please don't do this.
Harry: Hermione, please.
Hermione: It's - well, it's the Malfoy family motto. It's on their crest and everything.
Harry: How the fuck does the Malfoy family motto count as subjective?!
Hermione: Well...it could be...
Harry: Don't, Hermione. Just don't.
Unknown character: *She is left standing in the alley, and she needlessly straightened her robes before going to continue her Head Girl duties.*
Unknown character: *A week later, she carried her bags upstairs. She didn't intend to stop in the Head's common room, but as she gets to the stairs to her room, she hears a throat clear behind her and she stops. Look, Seb, today's been awful, can we skip tonight's meeting? She says before she can register the fact that her wrist isn't burning because of the bag hanging off of it.*
Harry: It's Seb, is it? That's awfully familiar. *She hears Harry's voice behind her and begins to berate herself for not looking around her.*
Hermione: We're familiar.
Harry: Really? That's interesting. *The tone in his voice infuriated her.*
Hermione: Not like that! Not that it would matter if it was. I don't know if you've noticed, but you've been...well, you've been a bit of a shite friend this last year.
Hermione: Me? *He stands up, and Hermione carefully sets her things on the staircase, before taking up a defensive stance.* You left while I was in the hospital. You didn't come to the Burrow all summer. You didn't tell us that you were planning on coming back to school. Then you're distant the whole time you're here, not even dropping a line to say when Hogsmeade weekends are so we could come see you. Or, better yet, you're Head Girl! You could come have dinner in the village any time you wanted!
Hermione: *Suddenly she is furious.* I put off getting my parents for a week waiting for you to wake up! I didn't leave your damn side longer than it took to pop home for clothes and a shower! And I would have thought you would expect me to come back to school.
Harry: *Some of the wind leaves Harry's sails.* I didn't know you'd stayed.
Hermione: *She allows herself to calm down a little, too.* You were hurt, Harry. Why would you think I would leave you?
Harry: *He collapses on the couch.* You wouldn't. Of course you wouldn't. *She isn't sure what to say, so she stands there until he says Look, can we talk?*
Hermione: I- *she wants to snap at him, but she is so tired, and NEWTs are closer than she*"
