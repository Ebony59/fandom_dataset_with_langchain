0,8887009,Emiya,Kiritsugu,"Emiya: I imagine that you were expecting someone else. *looks at Kiritsugu and Irisviel*
Emiya: So, clearly I am not King Arthur. Though maybe I am, due to my overwhelming memory loss.
Kiritsugu: How did you know about the summoning?
Emiya: I've met King Arthur before. And even if you had summoned the correct servant, you still would have been surprised. Given that she's a woman.
Kiritsugu: I thought you said you had memory loss.
Emiya: Oh, my mistake. I mean, I must have been told that somewhere. At some point in time. By someone.
Emiya: I do, but I'm not telling you.
Emiya: You could waste a command seal, and I'd have to give up a name, but then you'd be at a disadvantage going into this when you already have one in the fact that you didn't get Saber, you got Archer instead.
Kiritsugu: Is that true?
Emiya: Yes. And if you have enough patience to have a conversation with me, I'll even give you my true name by the end of it.
Emiya: No. You won't find me anywhere.
Kiritsugu: If I talk with you, you'll tell me the truth at the end of it.
Emiya: This is how this conversation will work. You'll figure out why I'm here and what I want, and I'll tell you exactly who I am. And then..."
1,8887009,Kiritsugu,Emiya,"Kiritsugu: If I talk with you, you'll tell me the truth at the end of it.
Emiya: This is how this conversation will work. You'll figure out why I'm here and what I want, and I'll tell you exactly who I am. And then--
Emiya: And then you decide what you want to do about the Grail War.
Kiritsugu: Fine. But this ends tonight.
Emiya: Great. I'll cook dinner when we're done. I can't trust you to do it. And when was the last time the castle was cleaned?
Kiritsugu: So why are you here?
Emiya: That's not how this works. A conversation has two people, not just one talking at the other one.
Emiya: Why don't we start with a simple question? The most obvious one?
Kiritsugu: Why did you materialize and not King Arthur?
Emiya: Normally in a summoning, you use a catalyst, right? Something to get the servant you want.
Emiya: And yet you got me. So how did that happen?
Kiritsugu: It shouldn't. I must have failed somehow in the ritual. Or the artifact could be fake.
Emiya: I can assure you that that is definitely Avalon. And I can tell you that whatever happened in the summoning, it wasn't because of you doing something incorrectly.
Kiritsugu: So then why, you?
Emiya: I'll give you a hint. It isn't something you did, but who you are.
Emiya: I have heard of one time where a master summoned a servant she did not intend to purely because of her connection to him in life."
2,8887009,Emiya,Kiritsugu,"Emiya: “I have heard of one time,” he says gently, “where a master summoned a servant she did not intend to purely because of her connection to him in life.”
Kiritsugu: Are you saying you and I are connected?
Emiya: Perhaps. Maybe it's because we're both fellow heroes of justice.
Kiritsugu: Do we know each other somehow? Have I met you before?
Emiya: No.
Kiritsugu: But we do share something.
Emiya: Yes.
Kiritsugu: You have a surprising amount of knowledge about the Grail War for a servant.
Emiya: True, that is normally the case, though I will tell you something else. There is at least one servant who has fought in a Grail War twice and remembered her first summoning during her second.
Kiritsugu: I was never told of that.
Emiya: It hasn't happened yet.
Kiritsugu: Just who are you?
Emiya: That's what you're trying to find out, aren't you?
Kiritsugu: You still haven't answered how you know so much about the Grail War.
Emiya: I know it because this isn't my first war. On either side.
Kiritsugu: You've been summoned before?
Emiya: Yes.
Kiritsugu: And you've summoned before.
Emiya: Yes.
Kiritsugu: And you remember everything?
Emiya: Yes.
Kiritsugu: Why?"
3,8887009,Emiya,Kiritsugu,"Emiya: Why?
Kiritsugu: Luck, in my experience, has little to do with anything.
Emiya: All true.
Kiritsugu: Archer, how do I know you?
Emiya: Not yet.
Kiritsugu: No. That's not going to work now.
Emiya: We had a deal. You find out why I'm here and what I want--
Kiritsugu: No. Because I think what you want is very dependent on who you are.
Emiya: You still haven't answered why I'm here?
Kiritsugu: I think you've answered that. You're here to fix something. Or else you wouldn't keep fighting in this war.
Emiya: What about being a hero of justice?
Kiritsugu: I think we both know how that works out.
Emiya: Well, you could have told me. You knew it would end that way and yet you didn't tell me not to do it. You just said you couldn't. You never told me I shouldn't do it."
4,8887009,Shirou,Kiritsugu,"Shirou: Well, you could have told me. You knew it would end that way and yet you didn't tell me not to do it. You just said you couldn't. You never told me I shouldn't do it.
Kiritsugu: You need to tell me the truth now, Archer.
Shirou: Call me Shirou.
Kiritsugu: We do know each other.
Shirou: Yes.
Kiritsugu: From the future, so not an ancestor. A descendant, maybe. Great-grandson? Grandson?
Shirou: Son. But you adopted me. I'm not related by blood.
Kiritsugu: I adopt you at some point. And at some point, you fight in a Grail War as a master. And another one as a servant. Is this all correct?
Shirou: Yes.
Kiritsugu: And then I summon you and--
Shirou: *silence*
Kiritsugu: *silence*
Kiritsugu: I know who you are. I know why you're here.
Shirou: I want to save you.
Kiritsugu: *puts his hand on Shirou's shoulder*"
5,8887009,Emiya,Kiritsugu,"Emiya: I can help you. I can make it right. *waiting for Kiritsugu's response*
Kiritsugu: Are you here to help me win the Grail? Is that why you came to me?
Emiya: I'm here to make sure you don't win. *preparing for Kiritsugu's reaction*
Kiritsugu: *surprised* Why?
Emiya: Because winning the Grail means you lose everything else. You lose your wife, your daughter, everything you believe in. Your wish causes a fire that kills hundreds of people and leaves children orphans.
Kiritsugu: *silent and wide-eyed*
Emiya: You want to know how you end up adopting me? My parents die in the fire. You save my life and die five years later. And it repeats all over again. There's another war. Another Grail. That's how I become a master. Because nothing you ask the Grail for will ever turn out the way you want it to.
Kiritsugu: *pale and horrified* Is that true? Is that what happened—will happen?
Emiya: I can't guarantee it. But you can't trust the Grail to give you anything you want. Nothing it offers is worth the price you pay.
Kiritsugu: *low and pained voice* Because you've paid that price.
Emiya: And so have you. Just not yet here.
Kiritsugu: *asking for a proposal* So what do you propose?
Emiya: You have family here. If you leave, the Old Man won't let them go with you and he'll find another master to replace you. Forcefully, if he has to. And if I play along, he won't let both your wife and daughter leave.
Kiritsugu: *defeated* Plus I risk Iri's life."
6,8887009,Emiya,Kiritsugu,"Emiya: I have one idea.
Kiritsugu: Yes?
Emiya: Cut off the problem at the root.
Kiritsugu: There's-- no way. You have to understand-- it's impossible.
Emiya: Command me to.
Kiritsugu: What?
Emiya: You know the command seals give immense boosts in power, enabling a servant to accomplish tremendous things if they will it. And this is something I will agree to. Use all three seals and tell me to do this.
Emiya: Command me. And I can save you.
Emiya: Please.
Emiya: This is the only way that I can think of, he pleads.
Emiya: Father.
Emiya: Please.
Kiritsugu: *opens his eyes and reaches up to touch his hair*
Kiritsugu: But what if I want to save you too?"
