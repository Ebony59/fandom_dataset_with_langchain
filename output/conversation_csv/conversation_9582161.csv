0,9582161,Tony,Peter,"Tony: Hey, kiddo. What's up?
Peter: Hey, Mr. Stark! I was wondering if you could maybe help me with my homework? I'm working on calculus, and I'm not sure what to do, and Aunt May can't remember anything past geometry.
Tony: Uh, yeah, sure, 'course. What're you workin' on?
Peter: L'Hopital's rule. I, like, I sorta get it, and I've got my notes, but I kinda zoned out for a minute, and I don't know how she did a part. Here, I'll send you a picture of the problem.
Peter: And so she said that this would be one to the power of infinity, but how would it be infinity? Wouldn't it be zero considering...
Peter: Fuck, I'm a dumbass. Never mind.
Tony: Glad I could help.
Peter: Yeah, yeah. Thanks."
1,9582161,Tony,Peter,"Tony: Glad I could help, *chuckles*.
Peter: Yeah, yeah, *mumbles* Thanks.
Tony: See ya, kid, *smirking*.
Tony: Alright, FRI, gimme something to do.
Tony: Dad, *says flatly*.
Peter: Mr. Stark, I- uh, I have a little bit of an emergency.
Tony: What'd you do, Parker?
Peter: So, uh, I was doing my thing, y'know, uh, fighting crime, and--
Tony: Peter.
Peter: I found a cat.
Tony: A cat.
Peter: Yeah.
Tony: Explain?
Peter: I'd just stopped this guy from mugging another guy, and I just heard these really sad and pathetic meows coming from the alley, so I--
Tony: Are you telling me you seriously just saved a stray cat from an alley?
Peter: ...Yes.
Tony: Oh, my God.
Peter: C'mon, Mr. Stark, Aunt May isn't gonna take in a cat! She's allergic!
Tony: And what am I supposed to do?"
2,9582161,Peter,Tony,"Peter: C’mon, Mr. Stark, Aunt May isn’t gonna take in a cat! She’s allergic!
Tony: And what am I supposed to do? Can’t you just take it to a shelter?
Peter: Well, first, he’s a he. Not an it. And… I kinda like the little guy.
Tony: Peter--
Peter: No, listen, hear me out! You get an adorable cat--
Tony: Peter--
Peter: --I get to visit him whenever I want--
Tony: That’s not--
Peter: --You’ll always have someone to spend time with if Rhodey and Vision are out, and he’s not a dog, so you don’t even need to take him out for walks or anything! C’mon, Mr. Stark! Please!
Tony: I-- *groaned, rubbing his hand across his face*
Peter: *interrupted by the smallest little mew he’d ever heard*
Tony: Peter, I don’t have ti--
Peter: *meowed again, Tony narrowed his eyes, walking towards his bedroom door where he’d heard the sound*
Tony: Peter, *a hint of a warning in his voice*
Peter: Please, Tony! Please! I named him T’Challa.
Tony: Are you kidding--
Peter: But come on, he looks just like him!
Tony: This is a very bad idea.
Peter: Yes! You hear that, T’Challa? You’ve got a new home!
Tony: We’re not calling him T’Challa.

Tony: *doesn’t want to call Steve, but sometimes he feels like he just needs to scream at Steve*
Tony: *misses his prank buddy, his science bro, his freaky assassin friend, his childhood-hero-turned-friend*
Tony: *reaches towards the phone, picks it up, and stares at it*
Tony: *swallows past the lump in his throat, looks at the phone in his shaking hand*
Tony: *hands hover over the buttons of the phone, but before he can do something he’d probably regret, he hears the elevator doors open behind him*
Tony: *twists in his seat to see Peter walk in with a crumpled suit in his hands*
Tony: *eyes widen and his hands fumble with the phone before he shoves it in one of the drawers of the workstation*"
3,9582161,Tony,Peter,"Tony: *his hands hover over the buttons of the phone, but before he can do something he’d probably regret, he hears the elevator doors open behind him.* Hey, kid, what’s up?
Peter: *Peter eyes him suspiciously before shrugging.* “Uh, do you think you could make my suit, uh- not flammable?”
Tony: *Tony’s eyes narrow.* “That’s what happens when you enter flaming buildings, you know.”
Peter: “I was getting people out of there!” Peter said indignantly. “And you’re one to talk, Mr. I-flew-a-nuke-into-space!”
Tony: “That was years ago, and it was different!”
Peter: *Peter simply quirked an eyebrow.* “Yeah, okay, Mr. Stark.”

Tony: *Tony sighs, spinning a washer on the desk in front of him.* Being alone is not a good idea for Tony, especially when he’s in this sort of mood.
Tich: “Meow.”
Tony: *Tony blinks rapidly, trying to snap himself out of his daze.* What do you want?
Tich: *The kitten has grown a considerable amount in the past three weeks, definitely has more meat on his bones, but he’s still a considerably small cat. He looks even smaller curled up, and he emits another small sound.*
Tony: *Tony feels a warmth in his chest.* You know that’s unfair."
4,9582161,Tony,Tich,"Tony: You know that's unfair, *crossing his arms*.
Tich: *doesn't break eye contact, stretches and gives a small yawn*.
Tony: Fine. But you're very whiny, *getting up from his seat*.
Tich: *preens as Tony sits down next to him and scratches behind his ears*.
Tony: *scritches across the soft fur*.
Tich: *cranes his neck up to look at Tony and meows, before darting onto Tony's lap*.
Tony: *stills as the kitten crawls across his thighs before settling between them with a yawn*.
Tony: *carefully leans back and rests his hand on Tich's head, feeling stupidly warm*.

Tony: No. *Mr. Stark--* No! They can stay at the compound, I don't fucking care, but I'm going to stay away from them, and they are going to stay away from me. That was the deal.
T'Challa: *silent for a moment* Very well. I will make it clear to them that they are to stay away from you.
Tony: *lets out a relieved sigh, swallowing thickly and nodding* Okay. Thank you, your highness.
T'Challa: Of course, *the call ends*.
Peter: Mr. Stark?
Tony: *looks up to see Peter walking in, Rhodey next to him*.
Rhodey: *leans against the wall for support, looking at Tony with concern*.
Peter: *frowning with his eyebrows furrowed*.
Tony: *shuts his eyes, rubbing a hand across his face*.
Tony: They're coming. Pardoned. They're going to stay at the compound.
Peter: What? *The question is asked by both of them*.
Tony: *sighs, dropping into a chair* It's all done. They're finally pardoned. Which. Great. The world needs the Avengers, whatever, I just-- *His breath catches, and he lets it out in a shudder*.
Rhodey: *approaching*.
Tony: *makes a mental note to make the braces quieter*.
Rhodey: *a familiar hand settles on his shoulder* You don't have to, Tones.
Peter: Yeah. I'll punch Rogers in the face if he tries anything.
Tony: *startled laugh* Thanks, Pete, but I don't think we need any more conflict, *he says, though he appreciates it greatly*.
Peter: Yeah, well, I didn't ask for permission, *Peter says*.
Rhodey: *humming his verification*.
Tony: *another chuckle* You're a bad influence on him, *Tony says, shaking his head*.
Rhodey: *shrugs, sitting next to Tony* I think I can live with that if I get to punch Rogers in the face.
Tony: Rhodey, *Tony whines*.
Rhodey: *talking over him* Seriously, if I could just give that dick a black eye, I would be the happiest man alive.
Peter: You two are ridiculous.
Rhodey: Nuh-uh, *Peter says, sticking his tongue out in true teenage fashion*.
Tony: *rolls his eyes as Rhodey settles his arm around his shoulders, letting himself relax*.
Tony: *he has these people, he'll be okay*.
Tony: *nope, nope, not okay, he's not okay at all*."
5,9582161,Tony,Peter,"Tony: just give that dick a black eye, I would be the happiest man alive.
Peter: You two are ridiculous.
Tony: Nuh-uh, *Peter says, sticking his tongue out in true teenage fashion.*
Tony: *rolls his eyes* as Rhodey settles his arm around his shoulders, letting himself relax. He has these people, he’ll be okay.
Tony: Nope, nope, not okay, he’s not okay at all. T’Challa may have promised to keep the Others away, but he isn’t exactly able to keep that promise when he’s busy ruling another country.
FRIDAY: Boss, the Avengers-- the captain’s Avengers- have entered the building.
Tony: What? Why’d you let them in?
FRIDAY: The security cameras in the front are still broken from this morning’s attempted kidnapping. I’ve refused access to the elevators, but that’s not stopping them from using the stairs.
Tony: O-okay, FRI, don’t- don’t let them- don’t-
FRIDAY: Boss, Hawkeye has his explosive arrows to get through any obstacles in their path. I’m sorry, I can’t-- Boss!
Tony: *slips to the floor, his hands reaching for his chest.* No, no, they can’t- I can’t see them. I can’t, FRIDAY, I can’t-
Tony: *lets out a quiet gasp* as the kitten makes his way towards him, looking at him with concern.
Tony: T- Tich, *Tony says, reaching*, and the cat hurries its pace and bounds across the floor until he reaches Tony. He sets his paws on Tony’s knee, tilting his head curiously.
Tony: I don’t want them here, *Tony says, his voice choking off.* I can’t, *he whispers*, and Tich’s ears twitch. The kitten quickly leaps into Tony’s lap, gently nuzzling his stomach.
Tony: *winces as he hears a faint explosion.* FRIDAY, tell the staff to go home. Structural integrity will be fine, but I don’t want anyone to panic.
FRIDAY: Boss, you’re panicking.
Tony: I’m aware, FRIDAY, *he snaps*, then winces. Tich looks up at him, his tail twitching. Sorry, *he mutters*.
FRIDAY: Completely reasonable, boss, *Friday says, her tone reassuring.*
Tony: *lets out a shuddering sigh* and gently cups the back of Tich’s head. The kitten nuzzles his stomach again, purring softly.
Tony: *flinches as another explosion is heard.* Boss, I’m trying--
Tony: I know, *he says, his eyes shut and his voice tight.* FRIDAY’s probably locking down everything she can, but Tony designed those arrows. They’re strong enough to get through anything FRIDAY puts up.
Tich: *meows, and it’s a distressed little sound*, and the genius feels a pang of guilt. It’s his fault this is all happening. It’s his arrows, it’s his fault they’re breaking in, it’s his fault that the security isn’t strong enough.
Tony: *another explosion, and Tony can start to hear the faint sound of hurried footsteps, slowly growing louder.* Stay away, stay away."
6,9582161,Tony,Peter,"FRIDAY: Staff has left the building, boss.
Tony: *tries to calm himself down, burying his fingertips in the kitten's fur* Stay away, stay away, stay away--
FRIDAY: You have no business seeing him, Rogers.
Steve: FRIDAY, where's Tony?
FRIDAY: Rogers.
Steve: *exasperated* Tony, you can't keep avoiding--
Peter: *storms into the room, his mask pushed down* I told you I would.
Tony: I didn't think you'd actually do it!
Peter: Hey, I promised Rhodey! Also, when he gets back, I'm totally telling him I beat him to it. *points at Cap* Fuck you, by the way.
Peter: *crouching and talking to Tich* Hey, Tich! How are you? You're getting tubby, has Mr. Stark been spoiling you?
Peter: Yes, I can. Rhodey and Pepper gave me permission.
Tony: But I didn't!
Peter: No offense, Mr. Stark, but you probably wouldn't let me punch whoever kills you.
Tony: Wait, why am I being killed? Why can't I die peacefully?
Peter: Because you're a billionaire and you don't protect yourself.
Tony: I have a flying suit of armor.
Peter: Which you fly."
7,9582161,Peter,Mr. Stark,"Peter: No offense, Mr. Stark, but you probably wouldn't let me punch whoever kills you.
Tony: Wait, why am I being killed? Why can't I die peacefully?
Peter: Because you're a billionaire and you don't protect yourself.
Tony: I have a flying suit of armor.
Peter: Which you fly into danger at every opportunity.
Clint: What the fuck?
Peter: Weren't you supposed to be retired anyway? What happened to spending time with your family?
Clint: The Accords weren't right!
Peter: One, they wouldn't have affected you if you didn't come out of retirement every five minutes, and two, how the hell is accountability not right? Did you even read the Accords? Why did you get into this mess in the first place? You had a family to take care of!
Peter: Same for you. You also had a family that you just dropped! Did you read the Accords?
Peter: I did! Yes, they weren't perfect, but they were amendable, not that any of you bothered to even try to listen when people pointed that out to you.
Peter: And you just follow him like a blind puppy! Did it not occur to you that just maybe accountability is important? That maybe the people of the world deserve to be safe? Or did you just hear Rogers say no and immediately follow him?
Peter: None of you thought about your actions. You would all blindly follow Captain America into the jaws of death just because he's Captain America.
Peter: So many of us looked up to you, and you deserve none of it.
Steve: Look, I'm--
Peter: Not sorry. Fuck you, Steve Rogers. Fuck your stupid phone. Fuck your letter. Fuck your apology. Fuck your hypocrisy. Fuck you.
Peter: Tony. Shut up.
Peter: How dare you believe that you had the right to keep the truth from him? You act like you're on this moral high horse all the time, but you're a regular person who fucks up and you need to know that. You claim to protect the little people, but you ignore one hundred and seventeen countries full of those little people, because you think you know better than them? Not to mention, you mistreated a man who did nothing but give and give to you for years! You blame him for Ultron, while you happily bring in the girl who supported Ultron and was the one who planted the idea in Tony's head in the first place, and--
Peter: You volunteered for a known Nazi organization!
Wanda: I was young, and HYDRA promised that I could get revenge on Stark for killing my parents.
Peter: You mean his weapons that killed your parents? His weapons that have been repeatedly verified that he had no control..."
8,9582161,Wanda,Peter,"Wanda: You volunteered for a known Nazi organization!
Peter: You mean his weapons that killed your parents? His weapons that have been repeatedly verified that he had no control over? He wasn’t firing the missiles, he was making them, and it was Obadiah Stane who was dealing them in the first place! And guess what? You may have been young, but don’t act like that excuses your actions. My uncle Ben died when I was young, and yeah, I wanted revenge, but I didn’t jump up to join a Nazi-terrorist organization. I didn’t fuck with a man who was already struggling with PTSD. I didn’t try to raise an AI that would kill humanity!
Peter: Maximoff planted the image of you guys dying and blaming him for it in his head. He saw all of you dead, and he wanted to stop that from happening. And of course, you berated him for hiding things, while you refused to tell him the truth about his parents! You knew that his parents were killed by the Winter Soldier, and you thought you could keep that information to yourself?
Peter: You didn’t have the right to decide, Rogers! That was Tony’s right! It was never yours, but again, because you thought you could do no wrong--
Peter: You left him in a dead suit in Siberia.
Peter: No, he wasn’t! You and I both know that Tony could have killed Barnes in one fucking shot, but he didn’t! He held back, because he wasn’t going to kill Barnes. You, however, you never hesitated! I saw the footage from the HYDRA base. You slammed your stupid shield into his head! Do you even know how much brain damage that could have caused?
Peter: Because Barnes touched the reactor. He tried to tear the reactor from the suit, and you fucking let him, and you knew that was a trigger for Tony! You knew about Afghanistan, about Obadiah, you fucking knew, and you just-- Fuck you, Rogers. Fuck you. Now, get the hell out of this building, because I already called the cops, and they’re gathering around this tower as we speak.
Peter: I came as quickly as I could. FRIDAY told me that they were breaking in, and I was nearby so I called the police and I tried to--
Tony: Peter, thank you. I don’t…
Peter: *gives him a small smile, quickly stumbling across the floor to wrap the genius in a hug*"
9,9582161,Peter,Tony,"Peter: I’m sorry.”
Tony: Sorry for what?
Peter: I’m sorry that you’ve had to deal with them for so long. You’re the greatest person I know, and they-- they treat you like a doormat, like they can just walk all over you and you’ll still be there when they get back, and they just-- you deserve so much better.
Tony: *lets out a watery chuckle*
Peter: I’m serious.
Tony: *gulps* I know. Just…
Peter: Don’t worry. One day, you’ll get used to people loving and caring about you. For now, I’ll just keep hugging you until it’s drilled into your brain.
Tony: *throws himself back onto Tony, and Tony lets out a startled oof before returning the embrace*
Peter: *after a minute* Did you really have to punch him in the face?
Tony: Absolutely.
Colonel Rhodes: *runs as fast as his braces will carry him to the living room where Tony’s helping Peter with his homework, gives Peter a high-five, hugs Tony, and curses the existence of Steve Rogers* Can’t believe you beat me to it, kid. Next time, I’m breaking his nose."
