Frank: Absolutely! We'll need our wands, some courage, and maybe even a pinch of Felix Felicis!

Harry: Haha, you always know how to make an adventure even more exciting, Frank. Let's go!

Frank: Hold on, Harry. We should bring some supplies too, just in case. I've got some Extendable Ears and a handful of Skiving Snackboxes.

Harry: Brilliant idea, Frank. Those Extendable Ears will come in handy for eavesdropping, and the Skiving Snackboxes might just save our necks.

Frank: Exactly, Harry. We work best as a team, always watching each other's backs. No matter what happens, we'll face it together.

Harry: You're right, Frank. Our friendship has seen us through dragons, dementors, and even the Dark Lord himself. Nothing can break us apart.

Let me help you up.

Draco: Save your concern, Potter. I don't need your pity. I can handle myself.

Harry: It's not pity, Draco. I just don't want to see you hurt. We may never be friends, but that doesn't mean I want you dead.

Draco: Hmph, you've got a funny way of showing it. Always getting in my way, making my life miserable.

Harry: Maybe if you didn't constantly provoke me, we might actually get along. But that's beside the point now. You need medical attention. Can you stand?

Draco: I suppose... I don't have much of a choice, do I? But don't think this changes anything, Potter. I still despise you.

Harry: Fine, hate me all you want. But for now, let's get you to safety. We'll sort out our differences later.

Draco: Safety? From what? My own family? They're gone, Potter. I have no one left.

Harry: I'm sorry, Draco. I didn't know... But you're not alone anymore. I'll take care of you, I promise.

Draco: You think I'd trust you? After all we've been through? You must be joking, Potter.

Harry: Trust takes time, Draco. But we've seen each other at our lowest. We understand each other's pain. It's time we put that to use.

Draco: And what if I refuse? What if I push you away like I always have?

Harry: Then I'll keep pushing back. Because despite all our differences, we've come to realize that we're not so different after all.

Draco: You really believe that, don't you? That we can actually find some kind of common ground?

Harry: I do, Draco. And I'm willing to fight for it. Together, we can overcome anything. You're not alone anymore."
