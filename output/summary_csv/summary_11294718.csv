Figured you could use a little pick-me-up.

Graves: *pausing from his paperwork* Queenie, you really shouldn't be bringing me treats all the time. I can't possibly eat this much sugar.

Goldstein: *smiling warmly* Oh, come on, Percival. You work so hard, you deserve a little indulgence. Besides, these pastries are too divine to resist.

Graves: *sighs, giving in* Fine, just this once. But don't make it a habit. I have a reputation to uphold.

Goldstein: *playfully teasing* Oh, what would people say if they knew the Director of Magical Security had a secret sweet tooth?

Graves: *smirking* They'd probably think I'm human after all. We can't have that, can we?

Goldstein: *laughs softly* You know, Percival, despite our differences in opinion, I appreciate your dedication to the magical world. We may clash, but I can see your passion.

Graves: *leaning back in his chair, studying Queenie* Likewise, Queenie. You have a unique way of seeing the world, and it's intriguing. Your love for magical creatures is admirable, even if I don't always understand it.

Goldstein: *grinning* Well, glad to know we're finally getting somewhere. Maybe one day you'll even join me on one of Newt's adventures.

Graves: *raises an eyebrow* Don't push your luck, Goldstein. I have my own battles to fight.

Goldstein: *leaning closer, a mischievous glint in her eyes* Oh, but Percival, imagine the wonders we could discover together. The magical world needs protectors like us, united.

Graves: *pausing, considering Queenie's words* Perhaps you're right. Maybe we can find a balance between our viewpoints. For now, let's focus on Newt's mission. We could be a formidable team.

Goldstein: *smiling brightly* That's the spirit! Together, we'll face anything that comes our way. And who knows, maybe we'll even change the world while we're at it.

Graves: *smirking, reaching for a pastry* Changing the world, one bite at a time. Count me in, Goldstein. Let's go save some magical creatures."

With each passing adventure, their friendship grew stronger, their shared laughter echoing through the air as they overcame each obstacle together. They became beacons of hope, rallying others to believe in their cause and defy the oppressive Rappaport's Law.

12,11294718,Percy,Graves,"Percival Graves and Newt Scamander have a complex relationship in the Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them fandom. Percy is an Auror who is fiercely loyal to Graves, the Director of Magical Security at MACUSA, and is willing to put his own life in danger in order to protect him. Graves reciprocates this loyalty, providing Percy with support and advice when needed. Despite their differing opinions, the two share a strong bond based on loyalty, understanding and a shared mission to protect the magical world. Percy eventually comes to understand Newt's ideals and helps him to repeal Rappaport's Law, which gives all magical creatures the rights and respect they deserve. This eventually leads to the two forming a strong friendship, which drives their success in protecting magical creatures.","(Scene: A dimly lit office at MACUSA. Percy Graves, a tall and imposing figure with a stern expression, paces back and forth while Newt Scamander, a gentle and soft-spoken wizard, stands nervously near a table stacked with magical creature files.)

Percy: (pausing mid-pace) Scamander, do you have any idea how much trouble your creatures have caused? The risk you've put us all in?

Newt: (quietly) I understand your concerns, Director Graves, but these creatures, they need our help. They deserve our protection.

Percy: (sighing, his voice softening) I can't deny your dedication, Newt. But we cannot simply ignore the laws that keep us hidden. Rappaport's Law is there for a reason.

Newt: (pleadingly) I know the law is in place, but it's outdated and unfair. We must find a way to change it, to ensure the safety and rights of all magical creatures.

Percy: (leaning against the table, his eyes meeting Newt's earnest gaze) I've dedicated my life to protecting our world, Scamander. I can't jeopardize that. And yet...there's something about your passion that speaks to me.

Newt: (softly) We both have a duty, Director Graves. To protect and preserve the magical world. We can do so much more if we work together.

Percy: (contemplatively) Perhaps you're right. Our missions may seem at odds, but at the core, we both seek to ensure the well-being of all magical beings. I didn't become an Auror to simply enforce the law; I became one to make a difference.

Newt: (a glimmer of hope in his eyes) Together, we can make that difference. We can show the world that creatures like your Obscurus can be understood and treated with compassion.

Percy: (nodding) It won't be easy, Scamander. Changing the law is an uphill battle. But with your knowledge and my influence, perhaps we can achieve the impossible.

Newt: (smiling gratefully) I'm grateful for your support, Director Graves. Together, I believe we can create a world where all creatures are valued and respected.

Percy: (extending his hand) Then let's shake on it, Scamander. A pact to protect the magical world, no matter the odds.

Newt: (firmly shaking his hand) A pact to protect and preserve. Together, we shall make a difference.

(Their hands clasped, the two allies forge a friendship built on loyalty, understanding, and a shared mission. As the office fades to black, the future holds promise for the magical creatures and the bond between Percy Graves and Newt Scamander grows stronger.)"
