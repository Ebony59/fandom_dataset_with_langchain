Peter: (grinning) Okay, Bucky, that prank we pulled on Sam last week was epic. I never knew you had a hidden talent for mischief!

Bucky: (smirking) Well, Peter, I've had a lot of time to perfect my skills. Being a former Hydra assassin does have its perks.

Peter: (teasingly) So, what else haven't you told me about your dark past, Mr. Barnes? Are you secretly a mastermind villain or something?

Bucky: (playfully rolling his eyes) Nah, I'm just a guy trying to make up for lost time. But don't worry, Spider-Boy, my loyalty lies with our team and keeping you safe. No villainous ambitions here.

Peter: (grateful) Well, I appreciate that, Buck. You've been looking out for me ever since that airport battle. And I gotta say, your wit and charm are seriously underestimated.

Bucky: (smiling) It's all part of my charm offensive, kid. Gotta win over the younger generation, you know? And besides, we gotta keep the Avengers on their toes with our shenanigans.

Peter: (nodding) Definitely. Remember that time we filled Tony's suit with web shooters? Classic!

Bucky: (laughing) How could I forget? The look on his face? Priceless. But hey, it's not all pranks and jokes, Peter. When the world is really at stake, we put our differences aside and fight side by side.

Bucky: (placing a hand on Peter's shoulder) That's right, kid. Teamwork and loyalty can conquer anything. Just know that you've got me watching your back, always.

Peter: (grateful) And you've got me too, Bucky. No matter how powerful the villain, we'll face them together. Our friendship is unbreakable.
