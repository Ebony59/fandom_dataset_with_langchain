4,4,13151907,James,Lily Evans,"James and Lily Evans met as 11 year old students on the Hogwarts Express. Despite James' initial admiration for Lily, she had a strong dislike for him and was often cold and distant. After leaving Hogwarts, James ran into his old friend Saturn Black in Diagon Alley and found out that she and her family had been ostracized for her wanting to be a witch instead of a wizard. James sympathized with her and offered her his support, and the two quickly became close friends and eventually fell in love. Despite his feelings for Lily, James was determined to protect Saturn and proposed to her with the help of his mother. After a brief ceremony, they were married with a wand-blessing ritual and a Scared Heart Betrothal Ring, last belonging to James' great-great-grandmother. Through their marriage, James and Saturn were able to create a new family and protect each other from the dangers of the wizarding world.","James: *leans against the compartment door, trying to catch Lily's attention* Hey, Lily! Mind if I join you?

Lily: *sighs and gestures for him to enter* Fine, but just this once. Don't think it means anything.

James: *smirks* Of course not, Evans. Just thought we could pass the time together. You know, as friends?

Lily: *rolls her eyes* Friends? You've got a funny way of showing it. Always pranking and showing off, thinking you're so clever.

James: *sits across from Lily and looks genuinely sincere* Look, I know I've been a bit of a git in the past, but I promise you, I'm not like that anymore. I've changed.

Lily: *raises an eyebrow skeptically* Changed? In what way?

James: Well, I ran into Sirius in Diagon Alley, and he told me what happened to you and your family. I... I felt terrible for all the pain you went through.

Lily: *softens slightly* You heard about that? Most people just ignore or make fun of it.

James: I could never ignore your struggles, Lily. I want to support you. I want to be there for you.

Lily: *genuinely surprised* You... you mean that?

James: *nods earnestly* More than anything. I want to be your friend, Lily. And maybe... maybe even more one day.

Lily: *pauses, her expression contemplative* I never thought I'd be saying this, but maybe... maybe we can start over. As friends. Proper friends.

James: *smiles warmly* I'd like that, Lily. I really would.

Lily: *grins shyly* Okay, James. Let's give it a shot. But if you ever go back to your old ways, I'm out.

James: *holds his hand over his heart dramatically* I promise, Lily. No more pranks, no more showing off. Just a genuine friend who cares about you.

Lily: *nods, the hint of a smile playing on her lips* Okay, James. Let's see if you can keep that promise.

And so, James and Lily's journey began. From the Hogwarts Express to Diagon Alley and beyond, their friendship blossomed into a love neither of them expected. Together, they faced the challenges of the wizarding world, protecting each other and forming a bond unlike any other. James, once the arrogant prankster, became Lily's unwavering support, and Lily, once cold and distant, found warmth and love in his presence. For James and Lily, their love transcended the magical realm, creating a new family that would stand together against any danger that came their way."
