MJ, with her signature stoic expression, stands next to him, arms crossed.

Peter: (whispering) Can you believe it, MJ? We're actually inside Stark Industries!

MJ: (sarcastically) Yeah, I'm thrilled. Remind me why I agreed to come again?

Peter: (excitedly) Because, MJ, this is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity! And maybe we'll even meet Tony Stark!

MJ: (rolls her eyes) Right, because meeting a billionaire playboy is exactly what I've always dreamt of.

Tony Stark walks into the lobby, striding confidently with a smirk. Peter's face lights up, and MJ observes their interaction.

Tony: (spotting Peter) Ah, Parker! Good to see you brought a friend. This must be your infamous MJ.

MJ: (deadpan) Infamous? I like it.

Tony: (smirking) You both have that extra something, you know? Anyway, welcome to Stark Industries. Thor is waiting to greet you both.

Peter: (whispering to MJ) Thor! I can't believe he knows my name!

MJ: (whispering back) Just another perk of being Spider-Man's sidekick, I guess.

Peter: (pauses, then softly) Actually, MJ... Tony offered me an internship. He wants me to join Stark Industries.

MJ: (surprised) Wow, Parker, that's a big opportunity. But why you? What makes you so special?

Peter: (smiling) I think it's because of my potential. Tony sees something in me. And maybe, just maybe, he sees it in you too.

MJ: (smirking) Oh, please. I'm not the superhero type.

Peter: (grinning) You may not wear a suit, but you're my partner in crime-fighting, MJ. You're just as important.

Their bond strengthens as they explore the Tower, solving puzzles and overcoming obstacles together, their friendship growing deeper with each challenge they conquer.

MJ: (smiling) You know, Parker, maybe this Stark Industries thing won't be so bad. We make a pretty good team.

Peter: (grinning) Yeah, we do. Who knows what amazing adventures await us here?

As they continue their tour, Peter and MJ become an inseparable duo, ready to take on whatever the future holds, side by side.
