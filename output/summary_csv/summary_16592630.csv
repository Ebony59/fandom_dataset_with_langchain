Newt: *smiling softly* Well, Theseus, there is much more to me than meets the eye. Porpentina understands my love for magical creatures, my passion for protecting them. She sees the value in what I do.

Theseus: *raises an eyebrow* Value? I always thought your creatures were nothing but a hindrance. But seeing how Porpentina believes in you, I can't help but wonder if I've been missing something all along.

Newt: *gently* You see, Theseus, it's not just about the creatures themselves. It's about the connection, the understanding. Porpentina has witnessed the impact these creatures have on the balance of our world. She appreciates their beauty and importance.

Theseus: *curious* And you, Newt, what do you appreciate about Porpentina? Is there more to this bond than just a mutual admiration for creatures?

Newt: *blushing slightly* Porpentina... she challenges me, Theseus. She pushes me to be a better version of myself. Her bravery and strength inspire me. And she's the only one who truly understands my quirks and obsessions.

Theseus: *smirking* Well, you've certainly caught Porpentina's attention. I've never seen her defend someone so fiercely. I must admit, it's intriguing.

What trouble have you stirred up this time, Porpentina?

Porpentina: (smirking) Oh, Theseus, you know me too well. Just a little run-in with some unruly dark wizards. Nothing I couldn't handle, of course.

Theseus: (chuckles) Of course not. You were always one to handle anything that comes your way. (pauses) But I do worry, Tina. You take on too much sometimes.

Porpentina: (rolls her eyes playfully) Theseus, you worry too much. I can handle myself. Besides, I've got a guardian angel looking out for me, don't I?

Theseus: (smiling) Yes, you do. Always watching over you, making sure you're safe. I'd do anything to protect you, Tina.

Porpentina: (touches his arm gently) And I would do the same for you, Theseus. We've always had each other's backs, haven't we?

Theseus: (nods) Since the very beginning. It feels like a lifetime ago when we first met, doesn't it? Our paths intertwined, destined to be together.

Porpentina: (grinning) You mean the moment I tripped and spilled that potion all over your robes? Ah, good times.

Theseus: (laughs) Indeed. It was the best accident that could have happened to me. It brought us closer, made us realize what we mean to each other.

Porpentina: (gazes at him fondly) You know, Theseus, I've grown quite fond of your creatures. They've got quite the personalities. How's that Niffler of yours doing?

Theseus: (smiles) Oh, he's always up to no good. But he's become quite attached to you, Tina. Thinks you're the best hiding spot for shiny objects.

Porpentina: (laughs) Can't resist a little temptation, can he? Well, tell him to behave himself. Can't have him stealing my keys again.

Theseus: (winking) I'll do my best, but you know how he is. Mischievous little bugger.

Porpentina: (grinning) Just like someone else I know. But I love you, Theseus. No matter how much trouble you bring into my life.

Theseus: (wraps an arm around her) And I love you, Porpentina. More than words can ever express. Our bond is unshakeable, our love unstoppable.

Theseus: (raising an eyebrow) Are you implying that we're in this mess because of you, Leta?

Leta: (mockingly offended) Oh, don't be daft, Theseus. We're in this mess because we can't resist the call of adventure, just like Newt and Tina here.
