Dumbledore's wise eyes softened with understanding, his gaze fixed on Remus. ""I understand your reservations, Remus. But we must consider all possibilities. Loyalties can be tested in the face of adversity.""

Remus sighed, his thoughts turning to the old days, when their bond was unbreakable. ""True, Albus. But our friendship, the bond we formed with James and Peter...it was stronger than anything. We were a family.""

Remus couldn't help but smile, his weariness momentarily forgotten. ""Oh, Peter. Always the jester, bringing light to our darkest moments.""

Peter puffed up his chest, grinning from ear to ear. ""Someone's gotta make you lot smile, right? Besides, we're in this together. Always have been, always will be.""
