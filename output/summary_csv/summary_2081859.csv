Steve knows from the start that Bucky is not his soulmate, as his mark is too large for Steve's. Despite this, Steve still dreams of Bucky's mark changing to silver, blue, or something iridescent if he were to lay his hand on it. As the story progresses, Steve learns that Bucky's mark is a brand, given to him by HYDRA, and not a soulmark. Despite this, Steve and Bucky's bond remains strong, and they continue to support each other through their missions and beyond. Steve eventually notices a faint handprint on his own neck, the same size and shape as Bucky's soulmark - revealing that Steve is the Asset's soulmate.

Through their connection, Steve and Bucky are able to understand and accept each other, and the Asset eventually trusts the man enough to choose him as his caretaker.
