Harry: *gratefully takes a seat at the kitchen table* I slept well, thank you. Dreamed about Quidditch, actually. 

Mrs. Weasley: *chuckles softly* Ah, Quidditch dreams. Those were simpler times, weren't they? Well, I'm glad you slept well. You know, we wouldn't want anything stopping you from enjoying your summer with us.

Harry: I do appreciate your enthusiasm, Fred, but I think we should focus on more important matters right now. Voldemort is out there, and we need to stay vigilant.

Fred: You're right, Harry. Serious times call for serious actions. We may joke around, but when it comes down to it, you can always count on us to have your back.

4,4,24904108,Harry,Snape,"The story also highlights the importance of relationships, and how having a sense of family, belonging, and support can make a huge difference in one's life.

Fred and George Weasley also display their love for Harry through their teasing and support, and Mrs Weasley welcomes Harry into their home with open arms. Through these relationships, Harry is able to find a sense of security and stability, something he has never experienced before.","As Harry walked into the potions classroom, he couldn't help but feel a sense of unease. Snape, with his greasy black hair and hooked nose, stood at the front of the room, his eyes piercing through anyone who dared to meet his gaze. 

Harry mustered up the courage to approach Snape's desk. ""Professor Snape, I need some help with this potion. I can't seem to get it right.""

Snape sneered, his voice dripping with disdain. ""Potter, as usual, you are utterly hopeless. Did you even bother to read the instructions properly?""

Harry clenched his fists, but forced a calm response. ""I did, sir, but I'm still struggling. Could you clarify a few steps for me?""

Snape's lip curled into a sarcastic smile. ""No, Potter, I will not hold your hand through every potion. You must learn to figure things out for yourself, as your saintly father never could.""

Harry's patience wavered, but he held his tongue. ""I understand, Professor. I'll try my best to work it out on my own.""

Snape's eyes bore into Harry's, a mix of annoyance and curiosity flickering in them. ""You've faced far worse than a botched potion, Potter. Surely you can handle this.""

Harry felt Snape's words hit him like a physical blow. It was true; he had faced countless dangers and challenges, yet Snape's skepticism always seemed to sting the most.

Before Harry could respond, the classroom door burst open, revealing Ron and Hermione, who had rushed to his side. Ron glared at Snape, his voice filled with fire. ""Leave him alone, Snape! He's trying his best!""

Hermione stepped forward, her voice unwavering. ""Harry's well-being is important to all of us, Professor. We won't stand for your constant belittlement.""

A flicker of surprise momentarily flashed across Snape's face, quickly replaced by his usual sneer. ""Do not lecture me on the importance of relationships, Miss Granger. I have no need for such sentimentality.""

Fred and George, overhearing the commotion, popped their heads into the classroom. ""You alright, Harry? Snape giving you a hard time again?""

Harry smirked as he looked at his friends, a sense of support washing over him. ""I'll be fine, guys. Let's just focus on getting this potion done right.""

Mrs Weasley, who had been passing by, entered the room with a warm smile. ""Everything alright in here, dears? Harry, you know you're always welcome at our home. We'll always be here for you.""

As Harry looked around at the familiar faces, he couldn't help but feel a surge of gratitude. They had become his family, and their unwavering support filled the void he had always felt. With them by his side, he knew he could face anything, even Snape's harsh words."

Hermione and the Weasleys share a strong bond of friendship and loyalty that helps them to stand up for justice and fairness.","Hermione's eyes sparkled with determination as she stood before the Dursleys, her posture tall and unwavering. Petunia and Vernon exchanged uneasy glances, feeling the weight of her intensity.

""Weasley family,"" Hermione declared, her voice ringing with confidence. ""Loyal, brave, and always willing to stand up for what's right.""

Vernon scoffed, his face reddening. ""Weasleys? What's that got to do with anything?""

""It has everything to do with it,"" Hermione shot back. ""They accept and respect me for who I am, intelligence and all. Unlike you, they see me as an equal.""

Petunia shifted uncomfortably, but her curiosity got the better of her. ""So, what unique talents do you possess, Granger?""

Hermione's eyes softened, a rare vulnerability shining through her fierce exterior. ""My knowledge and love for magic. They recognize and nurture my strengths, encouraging me to be brave and strong.""

Vernon sneered, his voice dripping with disdain. ""Magic? It's all nonsense!""

A mischievous smile played on Hermione's lips. ""But you see, Mr. Dursley, the Weasleys are magnetically drawn to my magic. They revel in it, embracing the wonder and excitement it brings. They understand the importance of embracing the extraordinary.""

Petunia's eyes widened, a flicker of envy surging within her. ""But you're just a muggle-born!""

Hermione's eyes gleamed with fire as she leaned in, her voice low and steady. ""That may be true, but the Weasleys never undermine me for it. Instead, they see my heritage as a source of strength, applauding my bravery and tenacity.""

Vernon's face turned a shade of purple, his voice booming with anger. ""This loyalty of yours means nothing! It won't protect you from the real world!""

Hermione's gaze locked with his, unwavering. ""On the contrary, Mr. Dursley, the Weasleys' loyalty has helped me survive the darkest of days. It has given me the courage to stand up for justice and fairness. And it will protect me, always.""

With a final nod, Hermione turned on her heel, the essence of the Weasley family's loyalty and friendship radiating from her. The Dursleys stood in stunned silence, their feeble attempts at undermining Hermione forever shattered by the strength of her character and the bond she shared with the Weasleys."

Ron: *frustrated* I can't believe they won't let us see him, Hermione! He's our friend, and he needs us!

Hermione: *soothingly* I understand, Ron, but Professor McGonagall has to make sure he gets proper rest and care. We need to trust her judgment.

Hermione: *sympathetically* I know it's hard to see him like this, Ron, but Professor McGonagall knows what's best. The healers are doing everything they can.

Ron's eyes flashed with determination. He crossed his arms, ready to argue.

Fred: Speaking of hearts, what's your plan to give those Dursleys a taste of their own medicine?

Fred: *laughs* Brilliant, George! Imagine Uncle Vernon with a bright pink afro. That will surely put him in his place.

George: And did you see those bars on Harry's window? It's like they're afraid he'll fly away on a broomstick or something. The nerve!
