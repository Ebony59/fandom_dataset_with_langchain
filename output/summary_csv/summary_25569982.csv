Intern: (calmly) Always ready, Flash. What's on your mind today?

Flash: So, I was reading about quantum physics, and I stumbled upon this mind-boggling concept. Can we really time travel?

Intern: (smiling) Ah, time travel, a fascinating topic indeed. While it's still theoretical, some scientists believe it could be possible, but the technology isn't there yet. However, it's essential to focus on the present and build our knowledge step by step.

Flash: (leaning closer) But don't you think it's worth exploring? Imagine all the mysteries we could unravel, the history we could witness firsthand!

Intern: (nodding) Your enthusiasm is admirable, Flash. The possibility of time travel has captivated scholars for centuries. But remember, we must first understand the laws of physics and the consequences before attempting such a feat. Patience is key in our pursuit of knowledge.

Flash: (grinning) I get it, Intern. Slow and steady wins the race. But what if we could borrow some of Stark's technological advancements? He's always pushing boundaries, right?

Intern: (chuckling) Tony Stark undoubtedly has an innovative approach. However, we must also consider the ethical implications of tampering with time. Our priority lies in expanding our understanding responsibly, respecting the boundaries set by science.

Flash: (raising an eyebrow) I suppose you're right, Intern. A measured approach is essential. But how can we resist the allure of exploring the unknown?

Intern: (thoughtfully) It's a delicate balance, Flash. We must remain curious, ask questions, and challenge boundaries, but always within the constraints of reason and our current knowledge. As we continue to learn, who knows what exciting discoveries await us?

Flash: (grinning) You're wise, Intern. I'll keep that in mind. I won't stop asking the tough questions, but I'll remember to tread carefully. Thanks for guiding me.
