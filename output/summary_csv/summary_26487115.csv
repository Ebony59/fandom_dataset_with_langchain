Snape: My Lord, I trust all is going according to plan?

Voldemort: Snape, my faithful servant. Yes, our plans are progressing as desired. The wizarding world will soon tremble at our feet.

Snape: I have taken the liberty of gathering information on Harry Potter, as you requested, my Lord. His every move is being closely monitored.

Voldemort: Excellent, Snape. The boy's fate is intertwined with mine, and it is crucial that we eliminate him swiftly. His demise will ensure my ultimate victory.

Snape: But my Lord, perhaps we can use Potter to our advantage. His unique abilities could be instrumental in achieving our goals, rather than simply disposing of him.

Voldemort: Do not presume to teach me strategy, Snape. I have already made my decision. Potter must be eliminated, as must anyone who dares to oppose me.

Snape: Very well, my Lord. Your will shall be done. However, I must remind you that I have pledged my loyalty to you, but my true allegiance lies with Dumbledore.

Voldemort: Your loyalty is a matter of convenience, Snape. It matters not, as long as you serve me faithfully.

Snape: My loyalty may be convenient, but it is not without limitations, my Lord. I will not stand idly by while innocent lives are lost.

Voldemort: Your sentimentality is your own weakness, Snape. But I suppose your power and cunning make up for it, to some extent.

Snape: I am glad you recognize my worth, my Lord. Perhaps I can be of even more use to you in the days to come.
