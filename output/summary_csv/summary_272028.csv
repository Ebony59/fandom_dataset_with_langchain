0,0,272028,Draco,Hermione,"In this fandom, Draco and Hermione are presented as two people who are determined to overcome any obstacles in their way. Draco is presented as a twenty-nine year old pure-blood who is expected by his parents to pick a bride and settle into a marriage contract. He, however, chooses to follow his heart and proposes to Hermione without his parents' interference. Hermione, on the other hand, is a strong-willed and independent woman, who is willing to forgive Draco and accept his proposal. Even after Draco's parents threaten to disown him, he still chooses Hermione and they eventually get engaged. Despite their initial differences in background and upbringing, the two have formed a strong bond, full of trust and understanding, proving the power of friendship.","Draco: *takes a deep breath* Hermione, my love, there's something I need to tell you.

Hermione: What is it, Draco? You seem tense.

Draco: *nervously fidgets with his hands* My parents, they want me to marry someone they've chosen for me. But I can't do it, Hermione. I can't marry anyone but you.

Hermione: *smiles softly, placing a hand on Draco's cheek* Draco, I knew this day would come. And I choose you too, no matter the consequences.

Draco: *relief floods his face* You have no idea how much that means to me, Hermione. I'm willing to face anything for us.

Hermione: *determined gaze* I know, Draco. And I'll stand by your side, no matter what challenges come our way.

Draco: *holds Hermione's hand tightly* They threaten to disown me if I choose you. But I can't let that stop me from being with you.

Hermione: We'll make our own path, Draco. We'll show them that love transcends all boundaries, no matter what they say.

Draco: *a spark of hope lights up his eyes* You really believe that, don't you?

Hermione: With all my heart, Draco. We'll prove to the world that love can conquer even the darkest of times.

Draco: *smiles, determination shining through* Then let's face this together, Hermione. Will you marry me?

Hermione: *tears of happiness in her eyes* Yes, Draco. I'll marry you, and we'll build a future filled with love and understanding.

Draco: *pulls her into a tight embrace* I promise you, Hermione, I'll never let anything come between us. Our love will prevail."
1,1,272028,Draco,Draco's mother,"The relationship between Draco and Narcissa is tested when Draco impulsively proposes to Hermione Granger. Narcissa threatens to disown Draco if he does not end his relationship with Hermione. Hermione leaves Draco in anger and Draco reflects on the importance of his mother's love and approval. After three months of estrangement, Draco is presented with a hand-carved necklace with a silver-blue dragon twined around a delicate pendant, a symbol of his mother's love and acceptance. He is faced with the dilemma of choosing between his mother's approval and his own happiness. Draco eventually chooses to stand by Hermione, no matter the cost, and reconciles his feelings for both his mother and Hermione.","Draco: *nervously pacing back and forth* Mother, I have something important to tell you.

Narcissa: *raising an eyebrow* What is it, Draco?

Draco: *takes a deep breath* I... I proposed to Hermione Granger.

Narcissa: *eyes widening in shock* Draco, you must be joking! You cannot seriously be engaged to a Mudblood!

Draco: *defensively* Mother, please! I love her, and she makes me happy.

Narcissa: *voice cold and firm* If you continue this relationship, you will be disowned. Is she worth losing everything for?

Draco: *in anguish* I... I don't know.

[Hermione enters the room, anger evident on her face]

Hermione: Draco, how could you? I thought you loved me!

Draco: *pleadingly* Hermione, please understand. My mother threatened to disown me if I didn't end our relationship.

[Hermione storms out, slamming the door behind her]

Draco: *regretfully* What have I done? I never wanted to hurt her.

[Three months later, a package arrives for Draco]

Draco: *curiously opens the package* A hand-carved necklace... with a silver-blue dragon twined around a delicate pendant?

[Draco's eyes well up with tears]

Draco: *whispering* It's from Mother... a symbol of her love and acceptance.

[Draco holds the necklace close to his heart, torn between his love for his mother and his love for Hermione]

Draco: *determined* I must make a choice... between my mother's approval and my own happiness.

[Draco takes a deep breath and makes a decision]

Draco: *resolutely* I choose to stand by Hermione, no matter the cost.

[Draco wipes away his tears, knowing that reconciling his feelings for both his mother and Hermione will not be easy, but necessary]

Draco: *whispering* I hope, one day, both of them will understand."
