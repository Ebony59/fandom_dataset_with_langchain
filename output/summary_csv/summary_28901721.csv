0,0,28901721,Draco,Rose,"Despite their differences, Draco and Rose develop a close bond. Draco is a former Death Eater who is now working at the Ministry of Magic, while Rose is a single mother and an employee of the Ministry. Rose visits Draco's office unannounced and the two develop a friendship as Draco finds solace in the relationship he has formed with Rose. Rose also asks Draco to name his stuffed dragon, and Draco reluctantly names it “Dragon”. Through their interactions, Rose and Draco develop a bond of friendship and understanding, and their relationship blossoms into something more. Rose expresses her love for Draco and Draco reciprocates with an heartfelt declaration. Eventually, Draco and Hermione build a strong connection and share a passionate kiss, which leads to a deeper understanding and appreciation for one another.","Draco sat at his polished desk, poring over Ministry documents. His steel-gray eyes fixated on the words, but his mind was somewhere else entirely. He was lost in the labyrinth of his own thoughts, haunted by the deeds of his past. The weight of his regret pressed upon him like a vice, squeezing his very soul.

Suddenly, the door to his office creaked open, and a vibrant burst of energy flooded the room. It was Rose, her fiery red hair cascading down her shoulders, a smile lighting up her face. Draco could feel a warmth spreading within him, a warmth he had long forgotten.

""Hey there, Draco,"" Rose chirped, her voice like a soothing melody. ""I hope I'm not interrupting anything important.""

Draco looked up at her, a spark of curiosity flickering in his eyes. ""No, not at all,"" he replied, his voice tinged with a hint of surprise. ""What brings you here, Rose?""

Rose's emerald green eyes sparkled mischievously as she held up a small stuffed dragon, its green scales glinting in the sunlight streaming through the window. ""I found this little guy in my daughter's toy chest,"" she said, handing it to Draco. ""I thought you could name him. It's only fair, considering I've told you all my secrets.""

Draco's lips twitched into a reluctant smile. ""Very well,"" he sighed, examining the toy with caution. ""I shall name him... Dragon.""

Rose burst into laughter, the sound like music in the room. Draco felt a warmth spread through his chest, a feeling he hadn't experienced in years. He couldn't deny the growing bond he felt with Rose, as if she was carefully stitching together the pieces of his broken heart.

Days turned into weeks, and their friendship deepened. They shared secrets, dreams, and moments of vulnerability, finding solace in one another's presence. The walls Draco had built around himself began to crumble, brick by brick, as Rose's infectious spirit filled the void.

One evening, as the moon bathed the office with its soft glow, Rose mustered up the courage to speak her heart. ""Draco, I... I think I'm in love with you,"" she whispered, her voice barely audible.

Draco felt his heart skip a beat, his breath catching in his throat. His eyes met Rose's, and he could see the raw emotions reflected in her gaze. Without a second thought, he stood up, closing the distance between them.

""And I... I love you too, Rose,"" he confessed, his voice filled with both fear and bravery. With each word, the weight of his past seemed to lighten, eclipsed by the newfound love and hope blooming within his heart.

Their lips met in a tender kiss, a union of souls long-searching for solace. In that moment, the world paused, and all that mattered was the connection they shared. Gone were the regrets and the darkness, replaced by a profound understanding and appreciation for one another.

Draco and Rose's love story would continue, their bond growing stronger with each passing day. Together, they shattered the shackles of their past, embracing a future filled with love, forgiveness, and a love that would conquer all."

2,2,28901721,Hermione,Rose,"When Rose meets Draco Malfoy, her mother's former enemy, she is intrigued by him and his office. Rose is fearless and inquisitive, and Draco finds her kindness refreshing. Draco is strict and frustrated at first, but soon warms up to Rose and even offers to help her mother with her work. Through their interactions, Draco and Rose form a close companionship, with Rose appreciating the stability Draco provides. Draco and Hermione come to respect each other and understand their shared love for Rose. They eventually become comfortable around each other and share a moment of understanding.","Hermione: Rose, please be careful around Mr. Malfoy. He was once our enemy, remember?

Rose: Mum, I know, but there's something about him that intrigues me. And have you seen his office? It's fascinating!

Draco: *sternly* Miss Granger, your daughter has been snooping around my office. I would appreciate it if you could keep her away.

Rose: *curiously* Why are you so strict, Mr. Malfoy? Can't you see I just want to learn?

Draco: *taken aback* No one has ever asked me that before. Well, I suppose I can see the kindness in your eyes, unlike your parents.

Hermione: Draco, I must admit, your willingness to help with my work surprises me. Thank you.

Draco: *grudgingly* Granger, consider this my way of repaying the debt I owe you. Your daughter's company isn't entirely unbearable.

Rose: *smiling* I appreciate your stability, Mr. Malfoy. It's comforting to have someone reliable around.

Draco: *softly* Stability is something I lacked in my youth. Perhaps that's why I find it appealing now.

Hermione: Draco, I have come to see you in a new light. We share a love for our daughter, and that is something we can understand.

Draco: *nodding* Yes, Granger, our circumstances may be vastly different, but our shared concern for Rose will always connect us.

Both Hermione and Draco: *in unison* We have come a long way, haven't we?

In that moment, a silent understanding passes between them, a realization that their shared journey with Rose has brought them closer than they ever thought possible. From enemies to respected acquaintances, their newfound camaraderie bridges the gap that once seemed insurmountable.

Setting: The Hogwarts Library, a serene and quiet place filled with ancient tomes and the familiar scent of parchment.

Hermione, engrossed in a heavy volume of Advanced Potion-Making, occasionally scribbles notes in her neat handwriting. Draco, leaning against a nearby bookshelf, watches her with interest.

Hermione lifts her gaze from the book as she catches Draco's eyes fixed on her. She arches an eyebrow, not one to be easily intimidated. 

Hermione: ""Can I help you, Draco? Or are you here to critique my reading habits?""

Draco smirks, a trace of mischief in his eyes.

Draco: ""Wouldn't dream of it, Granger. Just fascinated by your determination. Studying potions on your own when you clearly don't need to.""

Hermione chuckles softly, a rare moment of vulnerability seeping through her scholarly demeanor.

Hermione: ""Well, Draco, learning is a lifelong pursuit. And who knows what I might discover? Besides, it helps pass the time.""

Draco, for a fleeting moment, lets his guard down.

Draco: ""I suppose you have a point there. There's more to life than pureblood prejudices. I'm starting to see that now.""

Hermione: ""What made you change your perspective, Draco?""

Draco hesitates before answering, his eyes lingering on Hermione's face.

Draco: ""You, Hermione. Your unwavering strength and intelligence, even in the face of adversity. It's made me question everything I thought I knew.""

Hermione's expression softens, understanding filling her eyes.

Hermione: ""I never thought I'd hear those words from you, Draco. But I'm glad you've begun to see things differently.""

Hermione's heart skips a beat as she looks into Draco's eyes, seeing the vulnerability and sincerity there.

Hermione: ""I'm willing to try, Draco. Let's navigate the uncharted territories together.""
