0,0,32747020,Rose,Draco,"Rose is a young girl who has been adopted by Draco and Hermione Granger. She is a brave and fierce witch, with an unquenchable curiosity and a heart full of love. Draco was initially wary of taking on the role of a father figure for Rose, but he soon found himself falling more and more in love with her. Though Draco is not her biological father, he is always willing to protect her and provide her with the love and comfort of a father. Rose loves Draco deeply, and often looks to him for guidance and support. Through their relationship, the two have formed a unique bond that is filled with love, laughter and tender kisses.","Rose: *curiously* Draco, why do you always wear that silver locket around your neck?

Draco: *smiling* Ah, this locket is very dear to me, Rose. It once belonged to my mother, Narcissa. It reminds me of the love she had for me, and now it serves as a symbol of the love I have for you.

Rose: *gently touching the locket* That's so sweet, Draco. I'm grateful to have you as my father. 

Draco: *fondly* And I'm grateful to have you as my daughter, Rose. You bring so much joy and happiness into my life.

Rose: *playfully* Do you think I inherited my bravery from you?

Draco: *chuckles* Perhaps, but you definitely have your own unique brand of courage, my dear. You're not afraid to stand up for what you believe in, just like your mother.

Rose: *thoughtfully* I always wonder what my biological parents were like. Do you think they were brave too?

Draco: *gently* I'm sure they were, Rose. But remember, it doesn't matter where you come from. What matters is the love and support we give each other as a family.

Rose: *grinning* I'm glad you're my family, Draco. You're the best father I could have asked for.

Draco: *emotionally* And you're the best daughter a father could ask for, Rose. I promise to always protect you and be there for you, no matter what.

Rose: *sincerely* I know you will, Draco. And I'll always love you, forever and always.

Draco: *whispering* And I'll love you just as much, my brave little Rose."

3,3,32747020,Draco,Hermione,"Draco is a protective and understanding father figure to his adopted daughter, Rose, and although he is afraid of his inability to provide for her, he loves her with all his heart. Hermione is a supportive partner, both emotionally and physically, and reassures Draco that Rose loves and respects him. Their relationship is strong, and although they have different parenting styles, their devotion to Rose is undeniable.","Draco stood by the window, gazing out at the moonlit night, his mind plagued with worries about his ability to provide for Rose. Hermione approached him, her comforting presence calming his anxious thoughts. 

""Draco, my love,” she said softly, wrapping her arms around his waist. “You are the best father to Rose. She adores you, you know.""

Draco turned to face Hermione, his eyes filled with a mix of fear and affection. ""What if I can't give her everything she deserves? What if I fail as a father?""

Hermione placed a gentle hand on his cheek, looking into his eyes with unwavering support. ""Draco, you have already given her something no one else could - your love. Rose knows that, and that's all that truly matters.""

Draco sighed, his shoulders relaxing under Hermione's touch. ""I just want her to have the best upbringing, to be strong and capable. I don't want my past mistakes to affect her future.""

Hermione leaned in, pressing a tender kiss on Draco's forehead. ""You can't change the past, my love, but you can shape the future. And you're doing a remarkable job. Rose is a reflection of your love and dedication.""

Draco's chest swelled with pride, a small smile forming on his lips. ""Thank you, Hermione. Your unwavering support means everything to me.""

Hermione intertwined her fingers with Draco's, their bond strengthening with every word. ""We may have different parenting styles, but our devotion to Rose is undeniable. Together, we'll give her the love and guidance she needs.""

Draco pulled Hermione closer, their embrace a testament to their unbreakable unity. ""I couldn't do this without you, Hermione. You are the anchor that keeps me grounded.""

Hermione rested her head against Draco's chest, the steady beat of his heart bringing her comfort. ""And you, Draco, are the protector and understanding father figure Rose needs. We're in this together, always.""

As the moon bathed them in its soft light, Draco and Hermione stood together, their love and commitment shining through. Their journey as parents would be challenging, but their unwavering dedication to Rose would guide them through any storm that lay ahead."
