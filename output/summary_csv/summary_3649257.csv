2,2,3649257,Waver Velvet,Gilgamesh,"Waver Velvet and Gilgamesh are two characters from the Fate Stay Night and Fate Zero fandoms. Initially, Waver is intimidated by Gilgamesh's intimidating presence and his reputation for tyranny and violence. However, as their relationship develops, Waver slowly discovers more about the man behind the armor and the complex motivations that drive him. Waver and Gilgamesh share a bond that is both respectful and affectionate, with Gilgamesh often providing Waver with cryptic words of wisdom and Waver providing Gilgamesh with companionship. By the end of their journey together, Waver has gained a greater understanding and appreciation for Gilgamesh's true power and wisdom.","Waver Velvet paced nervously back and forth in the grand chamber, his eyes flickering anxiously. His heart raced as he awaited the arrival of the legendary King of Heroes, Gilgamesh. Stories of his tyranny and violence echoed through his mind, making him shudder with fear. 

Suddenly, the doors swung open, and there he stood, Gilgamesh, with his golden armor gleaming in the dimly-lit room. Waver couldn't help but feel a tremor of intimidation ripple through him as he met the King's piercing gaze. 

""Ah, the boy brims with fear,"" Gilgamesh's voice boomed, his tone dripping with condescension. ""Tell me, mongrel, why do you cower before me?""

Waver swallowed hard, summoning his courage. ""It's... it's your reputation, your Majesty,"" he stammered. ""The tales of your tyranny and violence... they have filled my dreams with nightmares.""

Gilgamesh's lips curled into a sly smile as he took a step closer to Waver. ""Ah, but you see, young one, there is more to me than meets the eye,"" he murmured cryptically. ""Behind the armor lies a man driven by complex motivations and desires that only the worthy can fathom.""

Waver's eyes widened as he listened intently to Gilgamesh's words. Despite his initial fear, a flicker of curiosity ignited within him. He had heard whispers of the enigmatic King's wisdom, and now, he yearned to unravel the mysteries that swirled around him.

As their journey continued, Waver found himself being pulled further into Gilgamesh's enigmatic world. The King of Heroes would often provide him with cryptic words of wisdom, challenging his perceptions and pushing him to question the very fabric of existence.

In return, Waver offered Gilgamesh a companionship that he had long been denied. Through their banter and adventures, a bond, both respectful and affectionate, began to blossom between them. Waver became the one person who could see beyond the golden armor and understand the depth of Gilgamesh's complexities.

With each passing day, Waver marveled at Gilgamesh's true power and wisdom. No longer intimidated, he saw in the King of Heroes a mentor, a friend, and a source of inspiration. And in return, Gilgamesh found solace in Waver's unwavering loyalty and genuine desire to understand him.

As their journey neared its end, Waver Velvet came to a profound realization. Gilgamesh, the infamous tyrant, was not simply a vessel of destruction and chaos. He was a being of immense power and wisdom, driven by a longing for greatness and a desire to leave his mark on history.

And so, Waver Velvet and Gilgamesh, the unlikely pair, stood side by side, their bond forged through time and adversity. As they faced the final battle, their eyes met, understanding passing between them, a silent acknowledgement of the profound impact they had made on each other's lives.

In that moment, Waver knew that he had gained more than just knowledge and power. He had gained a lifelong friend, and a deeper understanding of the complexity that lies within the hearts of men."
