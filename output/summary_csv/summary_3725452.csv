0,3725452,Seamus,Dean,"Seamus and Dean have been best friends since fourth year at Hogwart's School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. Their friendship is strong, built on mutual respect, admiration, and trust. Seamus notices Dean's handwriting on his hip and their conversation leads to Dean leaning in and kissing Seamus. In that moment, Seamus realizes that he loves Dean and wonders if their scrawls, a magical phenomena that allows people to see their soulmates thoughts written across their skin, match. Despite the teasing of their classmates, Seamus and Dean's relationship is further strengthened by the fact that they both have soulmates, and the story concludes with them sharing an intimate moment of understanding and connection.","Seamus: (playfully nudging Dean) Hey, mate, I couldn't help but notice your neat handwriting on my hip. Working on your calligraphy skills, are you?

Dean: (blushing slightly) Oh, come on, Seamus, you know I can't resist doodling whenever I get the chance. But I must say, my handwriting does look rather charming on you.

Seamus: (smiling) Well, I must admit, it certainly adds a dash of charm to my already handsome self. But seriously, how did you manage to write on my hip without me noticing?

Dean: (grinning mischievously) Ah, my friend, that's the beauty of magical phenomena. It appears our scrawls are more than just ink on paper. They have a mind of their own, finding their way to each other.

Seamus: (curiously) So, you're saying there might be a deeper connection behind these scrawls?

Dean: (leaning in closer) Perhaps, Seamus. Perhaps these scrawls are a reflection of what lies within our souls.

Seamus: (feeling a rush of emotions) Dean, I... I think I love you.

Dean: (gently cupping Seamus's face) And I love you too, Seamus. The scrawls merely confirmed what our hearts already knew.

Seamus: (whispering) But do you think our scrawls... match? As soulmates?

Dean: (looking into Seamus's eyes) Let's find out, shall we?

(As their hands touch, a soft golden glow envelops them. They watch in wonder as the ink on their skin begins to dance, forming intricate patterns that mirror each other perfectly.)

Seamus: (in awe) They match... our souls are truly intertwined.

Dean: (smiling) It seems the universe has conspired to bring us together, Seamus. Our love is meant to be.

(As their classmates tease and laugh, Seamus and Dean share a playful smirk, unaffected by their words. They take each other's hands, finding solace in their unbreakable bond.)

Seamus: (whispering) No matter what they say, Dean, we have each other. And that's all that truly matters.

Dean: (squeezing Seamus's hand) You're right, Seamus. Our love is stronger than anything they throw at us. We'll face it all together.

(And in that moment, Seamus and Dean share a tender and intimate connection, knowing that their love and understanding will always be their guiding light.)"
