Tony: (softening) You've got a bright future ahead of you, kid. I'm proud to call you my protégé.

Peter: (grinning mischievously) Speaking of bright futures, I've got an idea for a prank we can pull on the others. You in?

Tony: (raising an eyebrow) Oh, I'm always in for a good prank. What have you got in mind, Spider-Boy?

Peter: (whispering) Picture this: a fake spider crawling up Captain America's arm during a meeting. His reaction would be priceless!

Tony: (chuckling) I like the way you think, kid. Let's make it happen. But remember, no webbing his shield. We don't want to upset him too much.

Peter: (grinning) Noted, Mr. Stark. No shield webbing. Just a harmless scare.

Tony: (patting Peter on the back) You're growing up fast, Peter. Soon enough, you'll be running Stark Industries on your own.

Peter: (grinning proudly) And I couldn't ask for a better role model to learn from. You've taught me so much, Mr. Stark.

Tony: (smiling warmly) And you've taught me a thing or two about staying true to myself, Peter. I'm proud of the man you're becoming.

Peter: Thanks, Mr. Stark. That means a lot coming from you.

(They share a moment of silence, the unspoken bond between them evident.)

Tony: (breaking the silence) Alright, enough of this sentimental stuff. Let's get back to work and finish this prank. The Avengers won't know what hit 'em!

Peter: (grinning) You got it, Iron Dad! Let's show 'em what we're made of!

(They both laugh and continue their work, their friendship and shared love for pranks the fuel that keeps them going.)"
