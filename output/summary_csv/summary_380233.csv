Through moments of tension and attraction, Draco is able to realize that Potter is not a vampire, but instead is possessed by a powerful force. Potter then begins to show up and kiss Draco, leaving him feeling both confused and excited. Eventually, Draco visits Potter in the hospital wing to make sure he is telling the truth about his injuries. Here, they share a tender moment together, and Draco is overwhelmed by the urge to kiss Potter. Although their relationship is forbidden, Draco and Potter form a strong bond that is both passionate and forbidden.","Draco: *sighs dramatically* Potter, I've come to realize that you are not the vampire I suspected you to be. You're something else entirely.

Potter: *raises an eyebrow* Really, Malfoy? And what exactly do you think I am?

Draco: *pauses, studying Potter's face* You're possessed, Potter. There's a powerful force within you, one that both scares and intrigues me.

Potter: *leans closer, smirking* So, you're attracted to me now, Malfoy? Is that what you're trying to say?

Draco: *flushes, trying to hide his growing excitement* Don't flatter yourself, Potter. This is about solving a mystery, not about any attraction I may or may not feel.

Potter: *grins mischievously* Is that so? Because I could swear I saw a certain Slytherin blushing when I kissed him just a moment ago.

Draco: *stammers, caught off guard* That was all part of my investigation! I needed to see if the possession theory was correct.

Potter: *raises an eyebrow, unconvinced* And do you still need to investigate, Draco? Or is there something else you're curious about?

Draco: *averts his gaze, his voice barely a whisper* I...I had to see you in the hospital wing, Potter. To make sure you were truly injured and not using it as an excuse to get closer to me.

Potter: *softens, reaching out to touch Draco's hand gently* I wouldn't lie about something like that, Draco. I promise you, my injuries are real.

Draco: *feeling overwhelmed, he inches closer, their breaths mingling* I don't understand this, Potter. This desire I feel when I'm around you. It's forbidden, yet it's consuming me.

Potter: *leans in, his voice barely audible* Maybe some things are meant to be forbidden, Draco. And maybe we're meant to explore this bond we share, no matter the consequences.

Draco: *heart pounding, he closes the gap between them, their lips finally meeting* Potter... Harry, I...I can't resist you any longer."
