3,6071830,Tamamo,Carmilla,"Based on the original book, Tamamo and Carmilla are two powerful Servants who initially have a hostile relationship due to their differing outlooks. However, when Oda Nobunaga steps in, they come to understand each other's struggles and form a bond of mutual respect and admiration. Tamamo is a fox spirit with a deep understanding of humanity and an affinity for manipulating mental influence. She is fiercely loyal and protective of her master Ritsuka. Meanwhile, Carmilla is a powerful vampire warrior and Tamamo's rival. Despite their differences, the two share a strong bond and respect for one another. Tamamo provides Carmilla with advice while Carmilla is always ready to listen to Tamamo's wisdom. Together, Tamamo and Carmilla form an unassailable team that helps Ritsuka achieve his goals.","Tamamo: *crosses her arms, a mischievous smile playing on her lips* Oh, Carmilla, what a surprise to see you here. I hope you haven't been causing too much trouble in my absence.

Carmilla: *narrows her eyes, her expression icy* And what brings you here, Tamamo? I didn't realize I needed your approval for anything.

Tamamo: *laughs softly, her fox ears twitching* No need to be so defensive, my dear. I simply thought I'd offer my assistance, considering your recent… difficulties.

Carmilla: *grits her teeth, her fangs gleaming as she holds back her anger* I don't need your help, Tamamo. I can handle myself just fine.

Tamamo: *raises an eyebrow, a teasing glint in her eyes* Of course, of course. I'm sure you can handle everything on your own, darling. But wouldn't it be nice to have someone who truly understands by your side?

Carmilla: *pauses for a moment, her expression softening slightly* You think you understand me? That's a bold claim, Tamamo.

Tamamo: *steps closer, her tails swaying gracefully behind her* Oh, Carmilla, I understand more than you might think. We may be rivals, but we share a certain bond. A bond born from the struggles we've faced.

Carmilla: *sighs, her shoulders drooping slightly* Maybe… Maybe you're right. It can be lonely, fighting this constant battle with my own darkness.

Tamamo: *smiles gently, her eyes filled with compassion* We all have our darkness, Carmilla. But you don't have to face it alone. Together, we can help each other find the light.

Carmilla: *looks away, her voice barely a whisper* Perhaps… Perhaps I could use some guidance. If you're willing to offer it, Tamamo.

Tamamo: *extends a hand, her voice soft but determined* I will always be here for you, Carmilla. Just like I know you'll always be there for me. We may be rivals, but we're also friends. And friends support each other, no matter what.

Carmilla: *takes Tamamo's hand, a rare smile gracing her features* Thank you, Tamamo. I never thought I'd find a true friend in someone like you.

Tamamo: *squeezes Carmilla's hand, her eyes shining with warmth* Well, get used to it, my dear. Because together, there's no challenge we can't overcome."
