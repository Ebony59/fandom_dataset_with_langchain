Hermione: *looking up from her books, raising an eyebrow* What do you want, Fred? And why do you have that Extendable Ear?

Fred: *smirking* Just thought I'd give you a taste of my pranking skills. But I promise it's all in good fun. So, there's this new Weasley's Wizard Wheezes product I'd like your opinion on.

Hermione: *skeptically* I highly doubt you need my opinion on anything related to mischief, Fred. But fine, show me what you've got.

Fred: *extending the ear and placing it near Hermione's books* Here it goes, my brilliant invention to give books a voice! The ""Booktalker!""

Hermione: *surprised as the books start whispering in her ear* Fred, you've actually managed to create something useful. It's... impressive.

Fred: *grinning widely* Told you I could surprise you. So, what do you think? Could this be the next big thing at the library?

Hermione: *shaking her head, a smile playing on her lips* You're impossible, Fred Weasley. But I suppose your mischievousness has its charm. Just don't take it too far, alright?

Fred: *leaning closer with a mischievous glimmer in his eyes* Oh, but Hermione, where's the fun in that? You should join me sometime in one of my pranks. We could be quite the duo.

Fred: *grinning mischievously* Well, you are the brightest witch of our age, Hermione. Imagine the pranks we could pull off together! It would be legendary.

Hermione: *pausing for a moment, her eyes glinting with mischief* You know what, Fred? I think I might just take you up on that offer. But only if you promise to help me with my studies too.

Fred: *smirking* Deal, Hermione. Let the pranking and studying adventures begin. We're going to be unstoppable!
