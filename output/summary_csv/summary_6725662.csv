Tony and Sam Wilson, also known as Falcon, are seated across from each other at a sleek, modern glass table. Peter Parker, wearing his Spider-Man suit, stands nervously in the corner.*

Tony: *leaning back in his chair, smirking* So, Sam, how about we settle this annoying paperwork problem?

Sam: *leaning forward, arms crossed* Tony, I've already told you. I've got a mission to complete, and I can't babysit your friendly neighborhood Spider-Kid.

Tony: *playfully rolling his eyes* Sam, come on. You're practically Captain America's right-hand man. Plus, your wings make you the perfect chaperone for Peter here.

Sam: *sighing* Look, I'm flattered that you see my wings as handy, but I'm not a babysitter. Besides, you're Iron Man. Can't you handle this?

Tony: *grinning mischievously* Oh, I could, but I think Peter needs someone who understands the ""suit-wearing hero"" life. Someone like you, Sam.

Sam: *smiling, slightly caught off guard* Well, I guess I can't argue with that. But only if you promise to bring me that new Stark Industries gadget I've been eyeing.

Tony: *raising an eyebrow* Deal, but only if you keep an eye on Peter's training. I want him to be the best version of Spider-Man he can be.

Sam: *nodding* Deal. He's got some potential, that kid. I'll make sure he learns some tricks from the Falcon playbook too.

Tony: *leaning forward earnestly* Thanks, Sam. I know Peter looks up to you. You're like a father figure to him, someone he can trust in this crazy world.

Sam: *grinning, a hint of pride in his voice* Well, Tony, I'll do my best to be that person for him. He's a good kid, just needs some guidance.

Tony: *clinking his glass against Sam's* To Peter, the future of Spider-Man, and to our newfound partnership, my friend.

Sam: *smiling, clinking their glasses together* Cheers to that, Tony. We've got this, together. And who knows, maybe we'll even save the world in the process.

*As the two raise their glasses, Peter watches on, his nervousness fading away. He realizes that with these two heroes by his side, he is part of a greater family - a family that will always have his back.*"
