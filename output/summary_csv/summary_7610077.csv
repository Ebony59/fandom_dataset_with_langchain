Bob: *rushes in, looking flustered, accidentally crashes into Alice's table* Oh, I-I'm so sorry!

Alice: *looks up, smiling warmly* No worries, happens all the time. Are you okay?

Bob: *nervously adjusts his glasses* Yeah, uh, I'm fine. Hi, I'm Bob. Sorry again for the disturbance.

Alice: *extends her hand* Nice to meet you, Bob. I'm Alice. No harm done, believe me. What brings you here in such a rush?

Bob: *blushes* Well, um, this might sound strange, but a friend of mine asked me to pretend to be your boyfriend for a bit. There's this person who's been bothering you, and they thought it might help.

Alice: *raises an eyebrow, intrigued* Pretend boyfriend, huh? Well, that's certainly unexpected. But if it gets rid of this persistent admirer, I'm game. Let's give it a shot, shall we?

Bob: *relieved* Thank you, Alice. I really appreciate your willingness to go along with this crazy plan.

Alice: *grinning mischievously* Hey, life's boring without a little craziness, right? Let's have some fun and teach that admirer a lesson.

*time passes, admirer finally leaves*

Alice: *laughs* Well, that worked better than expected. Thanks for playing the role so convincingly, Bob. You're a natural!

Bob: *blushing* Uh, thanks, Alice. It was... um, interesting, to say the least. But I'm glad it worked out. 

Alice: *genuinely interested* You know, Bob, I think we make a pretty good team. How about we ditch the acting and be friends for real?

Bob: *surprised, but happy* I'd really like that, Alice. You're... different, in a good way. I think we could be great friends.

Alice: *smiling warmly* Excellent! Now, how about being my plus one to my friend's wedding next week? We'll have a blast, I promise.

Bob: *taken aback* Uh, sure, Alice. I'd love to. But I have to admit, there's still so much I don't know about you.

Alice: *grinning playfully* Well, Bob, get ready for a surprise. I'm not only into guys, I'm also attracted to women. Bisexual and proud, my friend!

Bob: *wide-eyed* Wow, Alice, I didn't see that coming. But hey, if our friendship is any indication, I'm ready to accept and support you no matter what.

Alice: *grateful* That means a lot to me, Bob. And I promise, I'll always be here for you too. We've got each other's backs, no matter what."

Harry: *smirks, looking up from his book* Oh, I thought it was Malfoy asking me out this time. I must be losing my touch.

Harry: *raises an eyebrow, concern flickering in his eyes* What is it, Draco?

Draco: *takes a deep breath, his voice slightly shaky* I hope you can accept this, but I'm bisexual. I've been struggling with it for a while, but I trust you enough to confide in you.

Draco: *relieved, his shoulders relaxing* Thank you, Harry. That means a lot.

Harry: *grins mischievously, pulling a small box out of his pocket* Speaking of accepting things, I got you something. Open it.

Draco: *curious, he opens the box to reveal a stunning set of knives* Harry... these are incredible. I've been eyeing this set for months!

Harry: *smiles fondly* Well, I figured it's about time I gave you a gift that shows how much you mean to me. And also, I've seen you cook. You need better knives.
