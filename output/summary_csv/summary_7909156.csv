Tony: Well, kid, it takes a lot of years and a ton of trial and error. But it's all worth it when I see what you can do with it.

Peter: Thanks, Mr. Stark. I couldn't have learned to control my powers without your guidance. You're like the cool uncle I never had.

Tony: *placing a hand on Peter's shoulder* You're more than just a kid, Peter. You're smart, you've got heart, and you never give up. That's what makes you a hero.

Peter: *grinning* Coming from you, that means a lot. Thanks, Mr. Stark.

Tony: No problem, kid. Just keep being amazing. And remember, with great power comes great responsibility.

Tony: I know you won't. Now, let's gear up and save the world, shall we?

Peter: Absolutely, Mr. Stark. Avengers, assemble!

*They both share a determined look and fist bump, ready to face whatever challenges lie ahead.*"
